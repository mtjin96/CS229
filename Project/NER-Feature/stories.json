The attack killed the governor of Kohistan district in Faryab, according to the provincial governors spokesman, Javed Bedar, who said the Taliban had taken control of the district.\n\nOfficials also reported fighting between Taliban and government forces in the northern province of Sari Pul. Authorities did not provide the number of casualties, Al Jazeera reported. \nEarlier on Monday, a suicide bombing at a government building in the capital city of Kabul killed 13 people and injured 31 others. The Islamic State (IS) claimed responsibility for that attack, on the IS-affiliated Amaq website. \nAlso on Monday night, a gunman and a suicide bomber driving a Humvee attacked a government building in the Afghan city of Ghazni, killing five police officers and wounding 26 other people, including the district governor, according to provincial governor spokesman Arif Noori. He alleged the Taliban was responsible for the attack. No group immediately claimed responsibility for it.\nInterior ministry spokesman Najib Danish said a government-declared ceasefire with the Taliban began Tuesday, under which it said it would not make offensive attacks against the Taliban. Its scheduled to last until June 20. On June 8, two days after the government declared its ceasefire, the Taliban announced a ceasefire on government forces to start later this week, coinciding with the first three days of Eid, the holiday that ends Ramadan.\nThe ceasefire went [into] effect this morning Danish said. We have ordered our forces to defend with all their power if they are attacked.\nThe Afghan government and the Taliban have continued to fight each other since the U.S.-led forces removed the Taliban from power in 2001 following the 9/11 attacks. Last year, more than 10,000 Afghan civilians were killed or wounded in conflicts between government forces and the Taliban.\nSources: Al Jazeera, Channel NewsAsia",

      "Content": "The G7 nations are scheduled to meet Friday and Saturday in Charlevoix, Quebec, to discuss trade and climate change, among other topics. The G7 is composed of Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the U.S. The EU also attends the summit. After the meeting, President Donald Trump is scheduled to leave Canada on Saturday for Singapore, in preparation for his planned June 12 meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said, We believe in the G7, its an important group. At the summit, Trump is scheduled to have one-on-one meetings with some leaders, including Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and French President Emmanuel Macron.\nOn Thursday, Trump met with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in Washington to discuss North Korea and trade. That morning, Trump tweeted he was getting ready to go to the G7 in Canada to fight for our country on Trade. \nThe Trump administration this year implemented tariffs on multiple imports, including steel and aluminum, citing national security concerns. Larry Kudlow, economic advisor to the president, said, \"Until we can have reciprocal relationships, we will not have free trade, and we will not have fair trade.\nTrudeau said of the upcoming summit, \"We know certainly that there will be frank and sometimes difficult discussions around the G7 table, particularly with the U.S. president on tariffs. Trudeau also planned to discuss gender equality and climate change at the meeting, according to Global News.\nAfter meeting with Trudeau on Thursday, Macron said, \"The G7 is an opportunity for us to get together and have frank, open discussions among nations who have long been allies and friends. He added that \"there will be subjects on which [Trump] is not totally in sync with the others -- I'm thinking of course of climate change and trade.\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel told the German Parliament on Wednesday that it is apparent that we have a serious problem with multilateral agreements here, and so there will be contentious discussions at the G7 meeting.\nReferencing a possible joint statement to be released at the end of the meeting, Macron said, \"Our common goal is to try to find a text that can be signed by everyone. He added that \"the desire to sign a common G7 declaration must not outweigh the need to be mindful of the content.\" Merkel said there would be \"no compromise for its own sake.\nG7 finance ministers met last week for three days. The six non-U.S. ministers ended the meeting with a message of concern and disappointment with U.S. tariffs.\nThe G7 was founded 42 years ago and its leaders meet yearly. The groups presidency rotates annually. Canada currently holds the presidency and in February published its G7 priorities for 2018, which include: \n\n\tinvesting in growth that works for everyone;\n\tpreparing for jobs of the future;\n\tadvancing gender equality and women's empowerment;\n\tworking together on climate change, oceans and clean energy; and\n\tbuilding a more peaceful and secure world. \n\nThis will be Trumps second G7 summit. Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte will be attending his first G7 meeting after being sworn in last Friday.\nTrumps policies on some international agreements\nSince taking office, Trump announced last June that the U.S. would withdraw from the Paris Agreement on climate change, saying the U.S. would begin negotiations to re-enter either the Paris accord or an entirely new transaction on terms that are fair to the United States. In May, Trump announced the U.S. would withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal, under which Iran agreed to restrictions on its nuclear program in exchange for a lifting of sanctions. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo later listed 12 U.S. requirements for a potential new agreement with Iran. \nLast January, Trump withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement that included Canada and Japan. In April, he asked his trade advisers to examine the possibility of re-entering negotiations for a trans-Pacific trade agreement if the U.S. arranged favorable terms. \nThis year, Trump implemented tariffs on solar cells, washing machines, and steel and aluminum. The administration said the steel and aluminum tariffs were related to national security concerns. The U.S. also let an exemption to steel and aluminum tariffs expire on June 1 for Canada, Mexico and the EU, which said they would implement response tariffs on U.S. imports. Mexico did so this week. Japan is also subject to the metal tariffs by the U.S.\nIn May, the Trump administration announced an investigation into whether automobile imports present national security concerns.\nThe U.S. has been in negotiations since last August with Canada and Mexico over the North Atlantic Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). \nSources: AFP, Global News, Reuters, The New York Times",

Political protests on an election day are prohibited in Russia, news outlet AFP reported.\n\nKlyukin also said that election meddling by a foreign company is not permitted in Russia. Google did not respond to a request for comment by AFP.\nRussias regional elections in September include 22 gubernatorial races, 16 parliamentary races and several municipal elections.\n\nBackground\nU.S. intelligence agencies have concluded with high confidence that the Russian government ordered an influence campaign into the 2016 U.S. presidential election. U.S. agencies also alleged that Russian companies stole and leaked information from American political groups, including the Democratic National Committee, prior to the election.\nNavalny has protested Putin and his government for several years, including a protest in June 2017 that resulted in his arrest. Navalny attempted to run against Putin in the 2018 presidential election, but was denied participation by the electoral commission due to a prior embezzlement conviction. Navalny, who says the conviction is without merit, called for Russians to boycott the election. Putin ultimately won the election with about 76 percent of the vote.\nNavalny is currently serving a 30-day prison sentence for reportedly violating public order laws during an earlier protest, AFP reported.\n\nSources: AFP, TASS",

      "Content": "U.S. President Donald Trump signed a new spending bill early Friday morning, ending a government shutdown that lasted a few hours after the previous temporary funding bill expired at midnight. The House of representative approved the bill around 5:30 a.m. in a 240-to-186 vote. The Senate had voted to approve the bill 71 to 28, with bipartisan support, after 1:00 a.m. Friday. \nThe shutdown\nThe government had automatically entered a shutdown, its second shutdown in two months, after the midnight deadline passed without the Senate approving a spending bill. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ken.) had spoken on the floor multiple times on Thursday and did not agree to move the time for a vote on a budget deal that Senate leaders announced they had reached on Wednesday. By not agreeing to move the time earlier, which required consent from all 100 senators, Paul delayed the vote until 1 a.m. Friday.\nHouse Minority Leader gives 8 hour speech\nOn Wednesday, the day before the funding deadline, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) held the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives for eight hours and seven minutes. Her address, given in support of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program (DACA), set a record for the longest continuous speech in the House chamber. It surpassed a previous record from 1909 of five hours and 15 minutes. Most members of the House have limits on the time they may hold the floor, but the House speaker, the majority leader and the minority leader may speak indefinitely under a special privilege known as the magic-minute. \nPelosi, 77, said she would vote no on the budget deal unless House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) allowed a vote on a plan that would provide protection for DACA recipients, also known as Dreamers, who are immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally as minors. DACA grants temporary work permits to qualifying applicants. The House had been scheduled to vote on the budget bill at midnight, before the Senate failed to pass it.. \nOn Sept. 5, U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that the Trump administration was rescinding the DACA program. On Jan. 9, a federal judge ruled that the administration must continue to renew DACA permits while there was a pending lawsuit against the repeal, filed by 15 states. The Justice Department said it would appeal that ruling. On Jan. 24, President Donald Trump announced a plan that would include a path to citizenship for immigrants enrolled in DACA.\nApproximately 800,000 Dreamers have received work permits and other benefits since 2012.\nSources: CNN, Fox News, The New York Times,The Washington Post",

At least 46 others are missing, Guatemalas national disaster agency said. \n\nThe eruption began before noon, sending ash 3.7 miles (6 km) into the air. The ash fell on the nations capital, Guatemala City, and on the nearby area of Sacatepquez Department, the town of Chimaltenango and city of Escuintla. Lava and pyroclastic flow began moving down the mountain at about 4 p.m. local time, entering villages and covering roads. \nThe National Disaster Management Agencys director, Sergio Cabaas, said the town of El Rodeo was buried. The director of the National Institute of Forensic Sciences, Fanuel Garcia, confirmed the updated death count of 62 on Monday evening. Rescue workers pulled at least 10 people alive from ash and mud flows on the volcano on Monday. Rescuers were still attempting to reach some of the affected villages as of Monday afternoon, BBC reported. \nHundreds of police officers, firefighters, soldiers and emergency workers have been deployed to the affected areas. Approximately 3,100 people have been evacuated and 1.7 million people have been affected by the eruption, the Associated Press reported. \nGuatemalan President Jimmy Morales declared three days of national mourning and said he would declare a state of emergency, which would need to be approved by Congress. The international airport in Guatemala city has been closed due to ash.\nVolcanic flow\nPyroclastic flow from volcanoes is a mixture of gas and hot volcanic material, such as pumice and ash, that can travel up to 435 mph (700 km/h) and reach temperatures between 392 and 1,292 degrees Fahrenheit, (200 and 700 degrees Celsius), according to BBC. Lava flow from Fuego reached 1,292 degrees Fahrenheit (700 degrees Celsius), according to Eddy Sanchez, the director of Guatemalas seismology and volcanology institute. \nVolcan de Fuego\nFuego is about 25 miles (40 km) south and west of Guatemala City and at its peak has an altitude of 12,346 feet (3,763 meters). An eruption in February sent ash 1.1 miles (1.7 km) into the air, and one in 1974 caused damage to local farms. No deaths were reported in either case. \nSources: AP, BBC",

Lpez Obrador formerly described a proposal to explore the possibility of amnesty for criminals.\nSpeaking about violence and government corruption, Anaya said gangs should be dismantled, instead of just removing the leaders.

      "Content": "North Koreas vice foreign minister said Wednesday that the U.S. must stop requiring the North to have unilateral nuclear abandonment in advance of talks between North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump scheduled for next month. North Korean state news outlet KCNA published the statement from the minister, Kim Gye Gwan, on Wednesday, after the North suspended talks with South Korea early Wednesday morning local time over military exercises the South was conducting with the U.S. \nA few hours after suspending the meeting with the South, North Korea said it was not interested in a one-sided meeting with the U.S. designed to have the North abandon its nuclear weapons program. \nIf the U.S. is sincere in its approach to North Korea, it will receive a deserved response from us, Kim Gye Gwan said. However, if the U.S. is trying to drive us into a corner to force our unilateral nuclear abandonment, we will no longer be interested in such dialogue and cannot but reconsider proceeding with the North Korea-U.S. summit. \nWhite House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said about the North Korea statement on Wednesday, if they want to meet, well be ready and if they dont thats okay, adding that Trump administration is still hopeful that the talks will proceed. Sanders said Trump was ready for very tough negotiations, and if the negotiations were canceled, the U.S. would continue with the campaign of maximum pressure against the North. \nTrump said well have to see if the talks proceed in response to the Norths message. When asked if the U.S. would still pursue North Korean denuclearization, he nodded. \nThe planned meeting between Kim and Trump, scheduled for June 12 in Singapore, would be the first between a North Korean leader and a sitting U.S. president. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo traveled to North Korea earlier this month in preparation, and the U.S. negotiated the return of three American citizens to the U.S. North Korea has canceled scheduled diplomatic talks in the past, The Associated Press and The Washington Post reported.\nNorth Koreas Kim has met with Chinese President Xi Jinping twice over the past two months. A Chinese government spokesman said the North and the U.S. should meet each other halfway in advance of the scheduled talks, and foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang said, the situation on the [Korean] peninsula has eased up, which is worth cherishing.\nCanceled South Korea meeting\nEarly on Wednesday local time, the North suspended talks with the South that were scheduled for later that day, calling South Korea-U.S. joint military drills a provocation and a preparation for an invasion of North Korea. The U.S. and South Korea began conducting air combat drills called Max Thunder with U.S. stealth fighters a few days ago. It has conducted the drills every year for about the past decade. \nThe Max Thunder drill is training for pilot skill enhancement, not an attack drill or implementation of an operation plan, a spokesperson for South Koreas Defense Ministry said. \nWednesdays meeting between the Koreas was to be a follow-up to the April 27 meeting between Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in. Following that meeting, the two leaders issued a document called the Panmunjom Declaration for Peace, Prosperity and Unification of the Korean Peninsula. That document announced the countries had agreed to work towards the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and a formal close to the Korean War that ended in an armistice in 1953. Wednesdays meeting had been scheduled to discuss these goals.\nKCNA reported that the military exercise was a flagrant challenge to the Panmunjom Declaration and an intentional military provocation running counter to the positive political development on the Korean Peninsula.\nUS strategy\nBoth Pompeo and national security adviser John Bolton have said the U.S. goal is for the North to have complete, verifiable and irreversible nuclear disarmament. Bolton said the North would need to agree to disarmament similar to the Libyan model. In 2003, Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi agreed to denuclearization in exchange for sanctions being lifted. Bolton was the under secretary of state for arms control at the time. Gadhafi was overthrown and killed by rebels in 2011.\nKim Gye Gwan said Wednesday that the world knows too well that our country is neither Libya nor Iraq, which have met a miserable fate, adding the North has a feeling of repugnance toward Bolton.\nBoltons statements are not an expression of intention to address the issue through dialogue. It is essentially a manifestation of [an] awfully sinister move to impose on our dignified state the destiny of Libya or Iraq, which had been collapsed due to the yielding of their countries to big powers, the vice minister said.\nSources: AP, BBC, CNBC, CNN, CNN, Reuters, The New York Times, The Washington Post",

Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said Ambassador to Yemen Vladimir Dedushkin and his staff will temporarily perform their duties in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Zakharova said the current security situation in Yemens capital Sanaa was the reason for the move.\nThe current conflict in Sanna began on Nov. 29 when Houthis and supporters of former president Ali Abdullah Saleh began fighting; the two groups were allies up to that point. Saleh, who was Yemens president from 1990 to 2011, was killed by Houthi forces on Dec. 2.\nIn 2014, Houthis and Salehs supporters formed an alliance to take control of Sanaa and oust then internationally recognized President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi. In 2015, Hadi left Yemen and Saudi Arabia and its allies intervened in the conflict, fighting against the Houthis and attempting to restore Hadis government.\nSources: Al Jazeera, TASS",

He ordered security forces to search for and confiscate weapons from parties \"outside the official security forces.\nShiite cleric Moqtada Al-Sadr, whose coalition won the highest number of seats in parliament after elections last month, said his followers should exercise patience and self-control regarding the incident, and that an investigative committee would report to him on the explosion within three days.\nSources: BBC, CBS News",

      "Content": "Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg met with EU lawmakers on Tuesday to answer questions about data analytics firm Cambridge Analyticas use of Facebook users personal data. Zuckerberg said Facebook had not done enough to prevent the tools weve built from being used for harm as well.\nWhether its fake news, foreign interference in elections or developers misusing peoples information, we didnt take a broad enough view of our responsibilities. That was a mistake, and Im sorry, said Zuckerberg.\nEU Parliament members asked Zuckerberg about new EU data protection rules, data privacy, online bullying, monopoly power and targeted advertising.\nZuckerberg did not answer certain questions on the cross-use of data from Facebook and its WhatsApp messaging service, and on the blocking of target ads, Reuters reported. Instead, Zuckerberg said he would follow up with answers later.\nZuckerberg said Facebook expected to comply with new EU rules, called the General Data Protection Regulation, which take effect this Friday. One rule stipulates that consumers must give affirmative consent before their data can be used by a business. Companies in violation of the new rules may receive fines of up to 4 percent of the companys worldwide turnover, or up to 20 million euros.\nIn April, Facebook said that data from about 87 million users, 2.7 million of which reside in the EU, had been improperly shared with Cambridge Analytica. Facebook has suspended 200 apps from its platforms as part of its internal investigation into third-party apps with access to user data.\nZuckerberg also said 500 million fake accounts were removed from the platform in the first quarter of 2018. He also said that Facebooks artificial intelligence systems can now flag 90 percent of content related to Islamic State and other militant groups without requiring user intervention.\nAs Zuckerberg noted during his testimony with U.S. lawmakers, he said Facebook plans to hire additional staff and develop artificial intelligence to recognize hate speech.\nAccording to Reuters, Zuckerberg plans to meet with French President Emmanuel Macron on Wednesday; he has declined to speak with British lawmakers. According to the Independent, Facebook plans to send either Mike Schroepfer, Facebooks chief technology officer, or Chris Cox, its chief product officer, in the CEOs place. The company did not provide a reason why Zuckerberg would not attend.\nSources: Fox News, Reuters, The Independent",

The Syrian government has denied allegations of the attack and invited international inspectors to the site.\nI ordered the United States armed forces to launch precision strikes on targets associated with the chemical weapon capabilities of Syrian dictator of Bashar al-Assad, Trump said from the White House Diplomatic Room shortly after 9 p.m. local time. \nThe president said the strikes were launched in coordination with France and the U.K. The combined American, British and French response to these atrocities will integrate all instruments of our national power: military, economic and diplomatic, he said.\nThe attacks were carried out by manned aircraft and ships that launched cruise missiles from the Mediterranean Sea. Around 4 a.m. local time, the missiles and bombs hit a scientific research center near Damascus and two chemical weapons facilities west of the city of Homs, according to Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff. One of the facilities in Homs was used to produce the nerve agent sarin, he said. \nThe Russian military said Syrian air defense units shot down 71 out of 103 cruise missiles fired by the allies. Syrian state-owned television said 13 missiles had been shot down by Syrian air defenses near the town of Al-Kiswa. \nU.S. officials disputed those statements, saying 105 weapons were launched and they all hit their targets. No aircraft or missiles involved in the operation were successfully engaged by Syrian air defenses according to Lt. Gen. Kenneth McKenzie, director of the Joint Staff at the Pentagon. He said the U.S. was not aware of any civilian casualties.\nTrump said the goal of the strike was to establish a strong deterrent against the production, spread and use of chemical weapons, and that the U.S. was prepared to sustain this response until the Syrian regime stops its use of prohibited chemical agents.\nTrump tweeted on Saturday morning: A perfectly executed strike last night. Thank you to France and the United Kingdom for their wisdom and the power of their fine Military. Could not have had a better result. Mission Accomplished!\nThe alleged chemical attack in the town of Douma, about 10 miles east of Damascus, reportedly killed at least 40 people and injured more than 500.\nRead the Raw Data on Russia's statements about the Douma attack.\nSources: CNN, Fox News,The New York Times, AP",

      "Content": "The European Union Parliament voted 448 to 197 (with 48 abstentions) to initiate a review of whether Hungary had violated EU law for allegedly restricting the media, denying refugees equal rights and other actions. The vote could eventually lead to penalties or sanctions on Hungary. Not everyone agreed about the vote. Heres a look at what leaders are saying:\nHungarys prime minister\nHungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbn alleged that the EUs decision was a response to Hungarys refusal to take in the number of refugees required by an EU-wide resettlement quota scheme. (Hungary has refused to take in refugees since the EU enacted temporary intake quotas in 2015.)\nRegarding his countrys decision to not take in the refugees, Orbn said in a January interview, We don't see these people as Muslim refugees. We see them as Muslim invaders, adding that Germany had wanted the migrants, but Hungary didnt. We believe that a large number of Muslims inevitably leads to parallel societies, because Christian and Muslim societies will never unite. He called multiculturalism only an illusion.\nHungarys foreign affairs minister\nThe decision of the European Parliament on the adoption of the [report on Hungarys alleged EU violations] is the petty revenge of the pro-immigration politicians, Hungarian Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade Pter Szijjrt said. He said Hungary would be reviewing the available opportunities for legal redress.\nInitiator of the vote\nEU Parliament member Judith Sargentini of the Netherlands issued a report listing Hungarys alleged violations, which led to the vote on Hungary. \nViktor Orban's government has been leading the charge against European values by silencing independent media, replacing critical judges, and putting academia on a leash, Sargentini alleged in a letter. Individuals close to the government have been enriching themselves, their friends and family members at the expense of Hungarian and European taxpayers.\nWe stand up for the rights of all Europeans, including Hungarian citizens and we defend our European values, Sargentini said of Wednesdays vote. Now it is up to the European leaders to take their responsibility and stop watching from the sidelines as the rule of law is destroyed in Hungary. This is unacceptable for a Union that is built on democracy, the rule of law and fundamental rights.\nPresident of the European Commission\n\nThe commissions president, Jean-Claude Juncker, who is ineligible to vote with the Members of the European Parliament in accordance with EU rules, said via his spokespersons Twitter account, that he was in harmony with today's decision.\nThe European Commission is using the tools we have, launching infringement procedures against countries that don't respect EU law, his spokesperson tweeted.\nOther criticism of Hungary\nAmnesty International's expert on human rights in the EU, Berber Biala-Hettinga, said the EU vote made it clear that human rights, the rule of law and democratic values are not up for negotiation.\nOther criticism of the EUs action\nSome politicians critical of the EU or centralized European government criticized the vote, such as British politician Nigel Farage, who led the campaign for the U.K. to leave the EU. \nEuropean Parliament votes to remove Hungarys voting rights, the authoritarian grip of the EU gets even tighter, Farage tweeted. \nGeert Wilders, leader of the Dutch Party for Freedom, tweeted, Hungary is the example for all EU countries and Orban is a hero and deserves the Nobel Prize.\n\nSources: BBC, Deutsche Welle, Deutsche Welle, EU Parliament release, Farage Twitter, Hungary MOFA, UPI",

Kyl had reportedly retired to spend more time with his family, The Associated Press reported. Kyl worked alongside McCain and Sen.

      "Content": "On Thursday, Japan announced it had executed by hanging the remaining six members of the Aum Shinrikyo religious group who had been on death row. The group was responsible for the 1995 sarin gas attack in the Tokyo subway system that killed 13 people and injured more than 5,500. Japan hanged seven other convicted group members, including its leader Shoko Asahara, about three weeks ago. \nOn March 20, 1995, the group released sarin gas in Tokyo subway cars. Five group members used sharpened umbrella tips to puncture plastic bags of sarin on three different subway lines that were scheduled to arrive at Kasumigaseki station within four minutes of each other, according to CNN. Within seconds, some victims were choking and vomiting, and some blinded and paralyzed. \nOn Thursday, Japanese Justice Minister Yoko Kamikawa said the extremely heinous crimes committed by the group had been carefully organized and planned, and that attacks of this size should never happen again. She said the attack was indiscriminate terrorism against the public that shocked the world.\nAsaharas death sentence had been set since 2006, according to Japanese broadcaster NHK. The other 12 group members appeals were exhausted in January 2018. Asahara, whose real name is Chizuo Matsumoto, never acknowledged his responsibility for the attacks during an eight-year trial, according to The Associated Press.\nThe six men executed Thursday included four who were involved in the subway train attack. Two others, one of whom recruited people into the group, were convicted of other crimes, including involvement in the 1994 attack, and the 1989 murder of a lawyer and his family. The lawyer had a class action lawsuit against the group, CNN reported. Some of the six men were also involved in the production of deadly chemicals.\nAuthorities also found Aum Shinrikyo responsible for a June 1994 sarin gas attack in Matsumoto that killed eight and injured more than 500. The group released sarin from a truck while driving around an apartment complex, CNN reported. Aum Shinrikyo was accused of being responsible for 27 deaths. Authorities raided its headquarters near Mount Fuji in 1995, and captured Asahara about two months later.\nMembers of the group believed the world was going to end in a global war, and that anyone who was not part of the group would go to hell unless group members killed them, according to BBC. \nAfter the Tokyo sarin attack, group members attempted and failed to release hydrogen cyanide in some train stations, BBC reported.\nAsahara started Aum Shinrikyo, whose name means supreme truth, in 1984. Japan granted it official status as a religious organization in 1989. At one point, the group had 10,000 members in Japan and 30,000 in Russia. \nAbout 2,000 people are members of three groups that formed after Aum Shinrikyo was broken up, according to AP. At least two of those groups are legal in Japan, with designations as dangerous religions that may be subject to surveillance. The U.S. and other countries have designated Aum Shinrikyo a terrorist organization.\nExecutions in Japan are performed in secret, with prisoners given less than a days notice, according to Amnesty International. There are currently 110 people on death row in Japan, with 88 of those appealing their cases, CNN reported.\nSources: AP, BBC, CNN",

His secretary Austin Fernando did not provide a reason for the suspension, according to Reuters. Parliament had been scheduled to have one more session before May 8. The suspension follows a vote in the Sri Lankan parliament last week to reject a no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.\n\nVotes of no confidence indicate that the parliament no longer supports the governments leadership and can lead to the dissolution of the government.\nIn January 2015, Wickremesinghe appointed Arjuna Mahendran, a Singaporean, as central bank governor. Mahendran was later accused of illegally aiding his son-in-law in a treasury bond sale; Mahendran denied wrongdoing. A parliamentary committee and a presidential commission investigated the bond sales and determined the prime minister was not guilty of any wrongdoing in the case, according to Lakshman Kiriella, the Leader of the House.\nOn Wednesday, six ministers from the presidents Freedom Party resigned their positions in the Cabinet, while staying in parliament. They, along with 10 state and deputy ministers who also resigned, had voted for the no-confidence motion. The 16 officials left the national unity government and said they would join the the opposition party in parliament. \nWe were to cross over and sit with the opposition on April 19. Now we will do that on May 8, said Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena, one of the 16 lawmakers who joined the opposition. \nSirisena appointed four temporary ministers, and said he would appoint a new cabinet, to be sworn in on April 23, according to Reuters. \nWickremesinghe is a member of the United National Party, which is in a coalition with Sirisenas Freedom Party.\nSources: AP, Daily FT, News 1st, Reuters, Reuters, The Hindu",

      "Content": "Gina Haspel, President Donald Trumps nominee for CIA director, said that under her leadership the CIA would not restart the detention and interrogation program that at one time included techniques such as waterboarding. Haspel made the statement while answering questions from Senate Intelligence Committee members on Wednesday in an approximately 2 1/2 hour open nomination hearing, before answering questions in a closed session. \nIn her opening statement, Haspel mentioned challenges the U.S. faces, including from terrorist groups and a nuclear threat against the continental U.S. from a rogue state. She also spoke about challenges from Iran, Russia and China.\n \n I would not allow CIA to undertake activity that is immoral, even if it is technically legal. I would absolutely not permit it. I believe CIA must undertake activities that are consistent with American values, Haspel said during the public hearing.\nI dont believe that torture works, Haspel said. We got valuable information from debriefing of al-Qaeda detainees. I dont think its knowable whether interrogation techniques played a role in that. \nWhen asked about videotapes of interrogations that her boss at the CIA, Jose Rodriguez, had ordered destroyed in 2005, she said she absolutely supported destroying them. She said the reason for doing so was that there was a great deal of concern about the security risk to the CIA officers shown in the tapes.\nJack Reed (D-R.I.) asked if Haspel would make a pledge of loyalty to Trump if he asked her for one. Haspel said, my only loyalty is to the American people and the constitution of the United States.\nPrior to the hearing, Haspel provided more than 100 written answers to questions presented to her by committee members. \n \nThe confirmation hearing was interrupted at least once by a protester, whom security removed from the building.\n \n Senate Intelligence Committee Chair Richard Burr (R-N.C.) said Tuesday that the committee may vote next week on its recommendation to the Senate on Haspels nomination, prior to the full Senates vote.\n \n Haspel, the deputy director of the CIA, has been acting director of the agency since former director Mike Pompeo left to become secretary of state. She started working with the CIA in 1985.\n \nSources: CNN, C-SPAN, The Washington Post",

Grant winners will relocate to France and receive up to $1.8 million in funding over three to five years. \nOne of the winners was Camille Parmesan from the University of Texas in Austin, who studies the effect of climate change on wild plants and animals. As part of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), she was a co-recipient of the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize. Parmesan will now continue her research at a center for theoretical and experimental ecology in Moulis, France.\nPresident Macron invited researchers to apply for the grants in June as part of an initiative he called, Make Our Planet Great Again. The initiative came after President Donald Trump withdrew the U.S. from the Paris climate agreement. Macrons grant offer received 1,822 applications, with two-thirds being from the U.S.\nThe grant winner announcement came a day before the One Planet Summit, which started in Paris on Tuesday. The Summit, which is co-hosted by the U.N. and the World Bank, will be attended by more than 50 world leaders. The meeting aims to innovate, support and accelerate our common efforts to fight climate change.\nSources: CNN, NPR",

      "Content": "Unite the Right, a self-described free-speech group that critics have called white nationalist, held a rally in Washington, D.C., on Sunday, to mark the one-year anniversary of the rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. About 40 protesters participated. Multiple groups of counter-protesters held their own rallies on Sunday, including an estimated 150 to 200 who identify as Antifa, or anti-fascists, and a couple hundred unrelated groups protesting white nationalism. No reports of deaths or major injuries have been filed. \nLast years Charlottesville rallies included violent confrontations between protesters and counter-protesters, including the death of Heather Heyer, a 32-year-old woman who was struck by a vehicle that drove into a crowd. Thirty-five others were injured in the violence, and two state troopers also died when their helicopter crashed as they were monitoring the protests. Ohio resident James Alex Fields Jr. was charged with Heyers death and a separate hate crime, and has pleaded not guilty. \nUnite the Rights organizer, Jason Kessler, had originally planned to hold an anniversary rally in Charlottesville, and was denied permission from the city. Kessler previously said he anticipated 400 participants for the Washington rally. Unite the Right protesters in Charlottesville held Confederate battle flags, swastikas and other Nazi symbols, and in one rally chanted the slogan, Jews will not replace us.\nOn Sunday, one man was arrested after assaulting another man who was wearing a Make America Great Again hat, police said. No other violent incidents between protesters and counter-protesters in Washington were reported.\nA select group of Antifa counter-protesters were involved in a brief confrontation with police and members of the press in the afternoon, near 13th and G streets NW. Some of the Antifa protesters, dressed in black, threw eggs and water bottles towards police or set off firecrackers and smoke bombs. Others reportedly knocked over trash cans. \nLaw enforcement measures\nD.C. police separated members of the rally and counter-rally from each other using barricades, motorcycles and their own bodies. The Unite the Right protesters were in a cordoned off area in Lafayette Square, across from the White House. \nPolice had posted placards in areas around the White House reading, All Firearms Prohibited Within 1,000 Feet of This Sign, from 6 a.m. to midnight. The rule was in accordance with a District of Columbia code, The New York Times reported, and mentioned Police Chief Peter Newsham by name. \nUnite the Right protesters were also escorted by police in a specially designated car from the Vienna Metro station in Virginia to a the Foggy Bottom Metro station in Washington. Kessler later tweeted that he apologized to people who missed taking part in the rally thinking that the train left at 3 p.m., and said he was given an ultimatum by U.S. Marshals to depart early or not at all. \nThe union representing Metro employees, two D.C. Council members and others criticized the transit authority for providing the additional protections for the group, with Council member Charles Allen saying it set a horrible precedent.\nLast week, D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) spoke about the planned protest. While we are opposed adamantly to what we are going to hear, we know what our responsibility is  to protect First Amendment events, to protect Washingtonians and to protect our city, she said. Bowser returned to the district from an official trip abroad to supervise the citys response. \nD.C. officials were calculating the total costs of additional police presence and other security measures as of Sunday night. Officials told The Washington Post that a portion of the expenses would be reimbursed by the federal government since the rally occurred on National Park Service land.\nKesslers comments\nKessler said at the second Unite the Right rally that he wanted to hold it because he wanted to stand up for free speech and public safety on the one year anniversary of Charlottesville. He said he was not there to celebrate the tragedies that happened last year, and instead wanted to tell the truth about what happened. He alleged the Charlottesville police violated the civil rights of rally-goers on both sides, and had allowed the violence to occur. \nKessler said he has never claimed to be a white nationalist and hes okay with sharing this country with people from around the world. He then went on to say but if you bring in too many people at once, its not the same country anymore and thats why a lot of white people feel aggrieved. \nKessler has been called a white nationalist, and a white supremacist by critics. \nSources: Fox News, Fox News, Politico, The New York Times, The Washington Post",

      "Content": "North and South Korea issued a declaration committing to denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and promising to formally end the Korean War. The declaration said the Souths President Moon Jae-in and the Norths leader Kim Jong-un solemnly declared before the 80 million Korean people and the whole world that there will be no more war on the Korean Peninsula and thus a new era of peace has begun. \n\nThe leaders met in the demilitarized zone between the two countries on Friday, as each stepped hand-in-hand onto the Norths side of the line for a moment before proceeding to the Souths side for a welcoming ceremony and talks. After the meeting, the leaders issued a document called the Panmunjeom Declaration for Peace, Prosperity and Unification of the Korean Peninsula. \nThe declaration said the two countries would actively cooperate to establish a permanent and solid peace regime on the Korean Peninsula, including ending the unnatural state of armistice that has existed since 1953, and would actively pursue joint talks with the U.S. or the U.S. and China this year to declare an official end to the Korean War.\nIn addition to committing to peace, the document confirmed the common goal of realizing, through complete denuclearization, a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula. It said, measures being initiated by North Korea are very meaningful and crucial for the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.\n The two countries also agreed to:\n\n\tadhere to their Non-Aggression Agreement that precludes the use of force in any form against each other, and to carry out disarmament in a phased manner.\n\timproving and cultivating inter-Korean relations such as through holding dialogues, fully implementing all existing agreements between the countries, jointly participating in sporting events, connecting and moderniz[ing] inter-Korea land transport routes and re-connecting relatives between the two countries;\n\tmake joint efforts to alleviate the acute military tension and practically eliminate the danger of war on the Korean Peninsula, including by establishing a maritime peace zone, holding frequent meetings between military authorities and ending hostile acts such as broadcasting through loudspeakers and distributing leaflets in the demilitarized zone by May 1.\n\nThis meeting was the first time a North Korean leader had entered the Souths territory since the 1953 armistice. At the talks, Moon also agreed to visit the Norths capital city of Pyongyang in the fall.\nEvents leading to the meeting\nOn April 21, North Korea said it would suspend its nuclear weapons tests, and its intermediate-range and intercontinental ballistic missile tests. The country is under U.N. sanctions for past tests, including a nuclear test in September and an intercontinental ballistic missile test in November of last year.\nSome countries have held talks with North Korea in the past to negotiate an end to its nuclear weapons program. In 2009, North Korea withdrew from Six-Party Talks that included South Korea, China, the United States, Japan and Russia. In February 2012, Kim agreed to suspend the Norths long-range missile and nuclear tests, as well as uranium enrichment, according to the U.S. State Department. In January 2013, North Korea said it planned to conduct long-range missile and nuclear tests again.\nUS Response\nIn response to the Korean leaders meeting, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said, We are hopeful that talks will achieve progress toward a future of peace and prosperity for the entire Korean Peninsula. She added, We wish the Korean people well. \nU.S. President Donald Trump is planning to meet with Kim in late May or early June, the White House has said. Mike Pompeo, who was confirmed as secretary of state on Thursday, met with Kim over Easter weekend.\n\nSources: BBC, The Korea Times, The Korea Times, The Washington Post",

Mahathir, leader of the Pakatan Harapan (PH), or Alliance of Hope, said his coalition had enough seats for a majority. The Malaysian Election Committee has yet to confirm the final results of the election. The committee said ballots for 176 of 222 parliamentary seats have been counted, with Mahathirs PH party winning 90, Al Jazeera reported.\nIf the election committee confirms Mahathirs party has won a 112-seat majority needed to form a government and select the prime minister, it would be the first time since 1957 that a party outside of the current ruling party, Barisan Nasional (BN), has ruled the federal government.\nAt 92 years of age, Mahathir, who served in the role of prime minister from 1981 to 2003, had been in political retirement for the past 14 years. He left the BN party to represent the opposition PH party and run against current Prime Minister Najib Razak, The New York Times reported, after Najib was accused of financial wrongdoing.\nIn a complaint filed in June of last year, the U.S. Justice Department claimed that Malaysian officials misappropriated $4.5 billion dollars, including $731 million dollars that were deposited in bank accounts belonging to Najib. Countries aside from the U.S. are also investigating the allegations, according to the New York Times.\nNajib has denied any wrongdoing in relation to the accusations and Malaysian officials have said there is no evidence to support the Justice Departments claims.\nMalaysian parliamentary system\nMalaysia, a former British colony in Southeast Asia, gained its independence in 1957 and established a constitutional monarchy. Under the countrys parliamentary system, there are two houses of government: the Senate and the House of Representatives. Members of the House of Representatives are decided through a general election every five years. The country is split into 222 separate districts, with each district electing one individual based on a majority vote to be their House representative.\nThe prime minister is not directly elected. Instead, the party or coalition with a simple majority in the House (112 of the 222 seats) selects a prime minister after the election. The prime minister runs Malaysias federal government.\nSources: Al Jazeera, Document Cloud, Commonwealth, Encyclopedia Britannica, Encyclopedia Britannica, The New York Times\n",

      "Content": "On Monday, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that Ohios voter removal process does not violate federal voter laws, overturning a lower courts judgment. Under Ohios policy, people who do not vote for two years are mailed a pre-addressed, postage prepaid card asking them to verify that they still reside at the same address. If a person fails to respond or vote within four years, his or her name is removed from voter registration rolls. \n \n Ohios state voting laws require eligible residents to register 30 days in advance of an election in order to vote.\nThe plaintiffs argued that the Ohio policy violated the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (NVRA), which makes it illegal to remove anyone from a voting list for failure to vote. Justice Samuel Alito, writing the majority opinion, concluded it did not violate the NVRA because Ohios process does not strike any registrant solely by reason of the failure to vote. \nAlito also cited 2012 Pew Center statistics that found 24 million voter registrations are estimated to be either invalid or significantly inaccurate, and that 2.75 million people are registered to vote in multiple states. \nChief Justice John Roberts, Justices Anthony Kennedy, Neil Gorsuch and Clarence Thomas voted with Alito for the majority. \nJustices Stephen Breyer, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan dissented. In the minority opinion, Breyer wrote that using a registrants failure to vote is not a reasonable method for identifying voters whose registrations are likely invalid. He wrote that in 2012, Ohio sent notices to about 1.5 million people, about 20 percent of the states registered voters, requesting address confirmation to continue on the federal voter rolls.\nThe state received about 60,000 return cards, or 4 percent of those sent out, confirming the person had moved, Breyer said, and about 235,000 cards came back saying the resident had not moved. More than one million were not returned, which Breyer said was largely due to the human tendency not to send back cards received in the mail.\nSotomayor, in her own dissenting opinion, said the ruling upholds a program that appears to further the very disenfranchisement of minority and low-income voters that Congress set out to eradicate with the NVRA. \nIn his opinion, Alito wrote, the dissents have a policy disagreement, not just with Ohio, but with Congress, adding, but this case presents a question of statutory interpretation, not a question of policy. It was not the courts authority to decide whether Ohios Supplemental Process is the ideal method for keeping its voting rolls up to date, Alito wrote. The only question before us is whether it violates federal law. It does not.\nBackground to the case\nThe case involved Larry Harmon, a resident of Akron, Ohio, who voted in the presidential elections during 2004 and 2008, and not in the 2012 presidential election or the 2014 midterms. In 2015, he attempted to vote against a ballot initiative and was informed he had been removed from the registered voters list. \nState officials said they sent Harmon a notice in 2011 and removed him from the voter rolls. Harmon said he didn't remember receiving the notice. \nIn 2016, a Cincinnati-based 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in favor of Harmon, concluding that using failure to vote as a trigger to send the notice was a violation of the NVRA. \nThe Supreme Courts majority opinion said, We reject this argument because the Failure-to-Vote Clause, as originally enacted in the NVRA , simply forbids the use of nonvoting as the sole criterion for removing a registrant, and Ohio does not use it that way.\nSources: Court Syllabus, Ohio Voter Eligibility, NPR, Reuters, The New York Times",

The plan was drafted in response to the results of a U.K.-wide survey of LGBTQ people, which received at least 108,000 replies. The plan would receive an initial $5.95 million (4.5m) in funding from the Government Equalities Office, for spending until the review period in March 2020.\nAs part of the action plan, the government would appoint a national LGBT health advisor to reduce the health inequalities that LGBT people face, as well as take steps to stop the practice of conversion therapy, which the plan describes as an attempt to cure LGBTQ people of their sexual orientation. The plan said the Government Equalities Office will fully consider all legislative and non-legislative options to prohibit promoting, offering or conducting conversion therapy. The plan noted that it doesnt intend to prohibit LGBTQ people from seeking legitimate medical or spiritual support.\nAdditional actions outlined in the plan include extending anti-homophobic, biphobic and transphobic bullying program in schools, and improving the recording and reporting of, and police response to, [LGBTQ] hate crime.\nThe online survey, which ran from July to October of last year, polled LGBTQ people about their experiences in the U.K. The survey found that 6 percent of respondents had been threatened with physical or sexual harassment or violence, 2 percent had experienced physical violence and 2 percent had experienced sexual violence within a year of the survey. \nTwo percent of survey respondents had undergone conversion therapy, while 5 percent said they had been offered it. According to The Guardian, all U.K. regulatory bodies associated with counselling and psychotherapy, and the National Health Service, have banned members from using conversion therapy.\nThe survey also found that 68 percent of respondents had avoided holding hands in public with a same-sex partner, and 70 percent said they had at times not been open about their sexual orientation.\nI was struck by just how many respondents said they cannot be open about their sexual orientation or avoid holding hands with their partner in public for fear of a negative reaction, U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May said in response to the plan. No one should ever have to hide who they are or who they love. [The plan will] set out concrete steps to deliver real and lasting change across society.\nThe U.K. said it aims to deliver the commitments in this action plan by the end of\nthe current Parliament, which ends March 2020.\nSources: BBC, The Guardian, LGBT Action Plan, National LGBT Survey",

Austins interim police chief Brian Manley said the suspect was killed in a self-detonated explosion after being confronted by police.\nManley said at a press conference around 5 a.m. local time that the main suspect had been identified and followed to a hotel he was staying at by tracking his vehicle. Officers from local and federal law enforcement took up positions around the hotel and waited for the tactical team in order to attempt to take this suspect into custody as safely as possible, Manley said. The chief said that while the officers held position, the suspect attempted to leave the scene in his vehicle and then drove into a ditch. A member of the Austin SWAT team approached when the vehicle stopped, and one SWAT officer shot at the suspect, Manley said.\nThe suspect is deceased with significant injuries that occured from detonating a bomb from inside his vehicle, Manley said. He added that the police could not publicly disclose the suspects identity at that time because he has not been positively identified by the medical examiner and next of kin have not been notified. \nA source from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives told Fox News that the bomber was identified as 24-year-old Mark Anthony Conditt. \nTuesday bombs and explosions \nLaw enforcement officials said that two bombs found in Texas on Tuesday were believed to be connected to four previous package bombs that exploded this month in Austin. One of Tuesdays bombs exploded at a FedEx sorting center in Schertz, near San Antonio, injuring an employee. The other was intercepted at a separate FedEx location about an hour away, the FBI sad. The ATF tweeted that the FBI and Austin police had confirmed a connection between the two on Tuesday and the four earlier bombs. None of the previous bombs had been shipped, police said.\nAlso on Tuesday evening, an incendiary device exploded in a south Austin neighborhood, injuring at least one person, according to officials with Austin-Travis County Emergency Medical Service (EMS). The EMS said a man in his 30s received potentially serious injuries and was hospitalized. The ATF said that no package bomb was found and that it currently does not appear to be connected to the previous bombs in Austin and San Antonio.\nEarlier explosions\nOn Sunday evening, two men on bicycles were injured in the explosion of a device in Austin, the fourth in 17 days at that point, according to the Manley. In a news conference, Manley said, we are clearly dealing with what we expect to be a serial bomber at this point, adding that it was possible the latest device was activated by someone either handling, kicking or coming into contact with a tripwire. Austin police have not identified a motive for the bombings.\nThe two injured men, aged 22 and 23, were taken to the South Austin Medical Center, where hospital officials said they were in good condition.\nManley told Austin residents not to handle, pick up, or disturb packages that looked suspicious or out of place.\nOn March 2, Anthony Stephan House, 39, was killed after a package outside his home exploded as he handled it. The explosion also created a hole in the wall and damaged the front door. \nOn March 12, another device left on the front porch of a home was brought into the kitchen where it exploded, killing Draylen Mason, 17, and injuring his mother, who is in her 40s and remains unidentified. The same day in a separate explosion, a 75-year-old woman was injured.\nAll three of those explosions were from devices in cardboard boxes that appeared to be left outside overnight, according to The New York Times.\nNo lead suspect\nThe first three explosions took place on the east side of Austin, and Mondays explosion took place on the west side of Austin. The victims were a variety of ages and ethnicities  House and Mason were black, the 75 year old woman is Hispanic, and the two men in Mondays explosion are white. \nFred Milanowski, special agent in charge of the ATF in Houston said, we have a high degree of confidence that the same individual built all these devices. The fourth device, the alleged tripwire, is more sophisticated compared to the first three bombs and not targeted to individuals, according to FBI agent Christopher Combs. Manley said there is no leading suspect at this time. \nThere are 500 law enforcement personnel involved in the case, according to Manley, some of whom came from outside Austin. Combs said FBI profiling experts were arriving in Austin from Quantico, Va. The Houston and San Antonio police chiefs said they would send bomb technicians and bomb-trained canine teams. Manley said officials have conducted 236 interviews to follow up on 435 leads. \nA $115,000 reward has been offered for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the person or persons responsible for the bombings.\nManley also spoke publicly to those responsible for the explosions, saying I will reach out to the suspect or suspects and ask that you contact us  There are innocent people getting hurt in this community and it needs to come to a stop.\nAustin police said they have received more than 1,200 phone calls about suspicious packages since March 12. \nSources: CNN, CNN 2, CNN Video, Fox News, Fox News 2, Reuters, The New York Times, Vox",

Prime Minister Shinzo Abe visited affected areas on Wednesday, saying After seeing that, I even feel more strongly about doing whatever it takes so that the people who were affected could live safely again as soon as possible. \nFloodwaters have dropped in most places, according to The Associated Press. The floods left behind debris including mud, broken trees, furniture and vehicles. More than 70,000 military, police and firefighters were searching the debris for bodies, Reuters reported.\nMore than 7,000 people were still in evacuation shelters after last weeks rains. There were power and water outages, and damage to roads and railway tracks resulted in limited deliveries of food and supplies to those affected. The government sent water trucks to evacuation centers, some of which had water shortages. High temperatures in the area ranged from 86 to 93 degrees Fahrenheit (31 to 34 degrees Celsius), according to Reuters. Some evacuation centers did not have sufficient air conditioning or fans.\nMore than 200,000 homes were without water, Reuters reported. McDonalds said five of its stores in Hiroshima and one in Ehime had water outages. Some convenience stores were operating on shortened hours due to supply shortages or flooding. \nAbe visited Kurashiki on Wednesday, and said he saw horrendous damage there from floods. He canceled trips to Europe and the Middle East to address relief efforts. He was scheduled to visit two other affected areas on Friday and over the weekend. \nSources: AP, Reuters",

Walmart said it expects the wage increase to cost $300 million for its next fiscal year, which starts Feb. 1, and the bonuses to cost $400 million. Walmart also announced on Thursday that it would close 63 Sams Club stores, converting about a dozen of them into distribution centers.\nSams Club has not announced how many employees would be affected by the closures. \nIn addition to the minimum wage increase and bonuses, Walmart announced other benefit increases. These include: financial assistance for full-time employees who are looking to adopt children, 10 weeks of paid maternity leave or six weeks paid paternity leave for full-time hourly employees, and six weeks paid paternity leave for salaried employees.\nThe federal minimum hourly wage has been $7.25 since 2009. States have individually raised their minimum wages, with some already at $11 per hour. In 2015, Walmart raised its minimum hourly wage to $9, and in 2016 to $10 for workers who complete a training course.\nAs a comparison, Target announced in October that it would increase minimum hourly wage for its workers to $11, and to $15 by the end of 2020.\nLast month, the U.S. passed a tax reform law that lowered the corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 percent.

Mohammed al-Bukhaiti, a spokesman for the Houthis, told Al Jazeera there were several casualties.

Saudi Arabia and U.S. officials have accused Iran of supplying weapons to the Houthis. Iran, which supports the Houthis politically, has denied this claim.\nThe missile was launched on day 1,000 of the conflict between the government and the Houthis in Yemen. The fighting has resulted in at least 10,000 deaths and over 2 million people displaced. In March 2015, a Saudi-led coalition entered the conflict after the Houthis seized Yemens capital from President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi.\nThis was the third missile launched from Yemen since November that Saudi Arabia says it has shot down over its territory. The first was on Nov. 4 near Riyadhs King Khaled Airport, and the second on Nov. 30 near Khamis Mushait.\nSources: Al Jazeera, Reuters, The Washington Post",

      "Content": "On Tuesday, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton (R) filed a lawsuit against the federal government arguing that the creation of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program was unlawful. The suit, issued against the U.S. and five federal government officials, is seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. The complaint was filed in U.S. District Court in Brownsville, and was brought by Texas, Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, Nebraska, South Carolina and West Virginia. All seven states have Republican attorneys general.\nThe five government officials listed as defendants are: Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, Commissioner of Customs and Border Protection Kevin McAleenan, Deputy Director and Acting Director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement Thomas Homan, Director of Citizenship and Immigration Services L. Francis Cissna, and Acting Chief of U.S. Border Patrol Carla Provost.\nDACA is a program that provides temporary work permits and protection from deportation to illegal immigrants who came to the U.S. as minors, provided they meet certain criteria. It was authorized by the executive branch through the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in 2012.\nPaxton said Wednesdays lawsuit is about the rule of law, not the wisdom of any particular immigration policy. He said, DACA sets a dangerous precedent by giving the executive branch sweeping authority to ignore the laws enacted by Congress and change our nations immigration laws to suit a presidents own policy preferences.\nThe suit asks for the court to prohibit the government from issuing or renewing DACA permits in the future, effectively phasing out the program within two years.\nLast September, President Donald Trump said DACA would be phased out, with no new work permits or renewals issued after March 5. The DHS also issued a memo then rescinding DACA. Earlier this year, rulings from U.S. district courts in California and New York ordered the government to continue renewing DACA work permits while those courts heard cases on the program; the rulings did not require the government to accept new applications for the program. \nOn April 25, a U.S. district court in the District of Columbia ruled that DHS had 90 days to better explain its decision to terminate DACA, or the court would require the government to accept new applications.\nFor more information on DACA, see our explainer here.\nSources: Lawsuit, The New York Times, The Washington Post, USA Today",

      "Content": "A woman accused of being a Russian spy, Maria Butina, pleaded not guilty at a detention hearing on Wednesday. Butina, 29, is charged with conspiracy to act as an unregistered agent of the Russian government. The judge ordered her held without bond. Prosecutors argued that she was a flight risk since she is a Russian citizen with no meaningful ties to the U.S. Her lawyer said she had been cooperating with federal investigators before her arrest and had not attempted to flee.\nButina was arrested Sunday. Court documents said she allegedly gained access to \"an extensive network of U.S. persons in positions to influence political activities in the United States\" through her relationship with a 56-year-old unnamed U.S. Person 1 with whom she lived.\nButina appears to treat [the relationship with U.S. Person 1] as simply a necessary aspect of her activities,\" according to prosecutors. They said, in papers seized by the FBI, Butina complained about living with U.S. Person 1 and expressed disdain for continuing to cohabitate with U.S. Person 1.\" Prosecutors added, on at least one occasion, Butina offered an individual other than U.S. Person 1 sex in exchange for a position within a special interest organization.\nAccording to the FBI, Butina attempted to establish relationships with a gun rights organization. The FBI did not name the organization; NBC News reported that a senior U.S. official confirmed it was the National Rifle Association (NRA). The NRA did not respond to NBC News requests for comment.\nProsecutors also said Butina had communicated repeatedly with a Russian official, whom NBC News said sources identified as politician and banker Aleksandr Torshin. Torshin allegedly wrote to Butina in March 2017 that given news coverage of her as a guns rights activist, she had upstaged Anna Chapman. Chapman was one member of a ring of Russian covert agents who were arrested in 2010, according to prosecutors.\nButina also allegedly had the contact information of individuals identified as employees of the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB), a Russian intelligence organization, according to prosecutors. Based on this and other evidence, the FBI believes that the defendant was likely in contact with the FSB throughout her stay in the United States, prosecutors wrote.\nButinas lawyer, Robert Driscoll, said, My client is famous in Russia. He was referring to Butina being a pro-gun figure in Russia, according to Fox News. He said, There is simply no indication of Ms. Butina seeking to influence or undermine any specific policy or law, or the U.S. itself. He also said Butina had been cooperating with the government, including appearing before the Senate Intelligence Committee and allowing the FBI to search her apartment in April. He added, shes been aware of a criminal investigation into her conduct for months and made no effort or attempt to flee.\nProsecutors wrote in their request for a bond denial, Her last tie to the District of Columbiaher apartment leaseends on July 31, 2018, and there were boxes packed in her apartment consistent with a move at the time of her arrest.\nButina entered the U.S. in 2016 on a graduate student visa, and was a student in international relations at American University in Washington, D.C. She attended President Donald Trumps inauguration with Paul Erickson, a Republican activist, according to Fox News.\nRussian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova, related Butinas arrest to Mondays Trump-Putin summit in Helsinki. She said, \"It seems that somebody just got out a calculator and a watch to figure out when this decision about the arrest of Maria Butina should be taken, in order to do everything possible to derail the outcome of the summit that was held with the Russia and American presidents. She added, \"Everything was done to coincide with this.\"\nSources: Fox News, NBC News",

The strikes killed 73 people on Thursday, according to SOHR.\nSeparately, the U.S.-led air and artillery strikes began overnight Wednesday in Deir al-Zour province. The Pentagon said the strikes were in response to an attack by the Syrian military on the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) headquarters near the town of Khusham. \nThe Pentagon said that earlier on Wednesday evening, an estimated 500 Syrian government fighters and heavy artillery had crossed an agreed demarcation line along the Euphrates river and had launched an unprovoked attack on the SDF headquarters. Syrian forces control the western side of the line, and the SDF controls the eastern side of the line. \nSOHR said the fighters that attacked the SDF headquarters consisted of Afghan Shiite forces and local tribesmen in support of President Bashar Assad. A spokesman for the U.S. coalition said Russia told the coalition that it was not involved in the attack on the SDF headquarters. \nThe U.S. said Russian mercenaries were among the casualties in Wednesdays strikes. Russia said it did not have personnel in the area, and its defense ministry said it only confirmed 25 Syrian militia were wounded, and no deaths. \nThe Syrian foreign ministry said it wrote to the U.N., saying the U.S.-led strikes Wednesday night are a war crime and crime against humanity and asked for international condemnation of the attacks.\nThe U.N. had called for a month-long ceasefire in Syria on Tuesday.\n Sources: BBC, NPR, SOHR",

      "Content": "On Sunday, the U.S. mission in Turkey suspended its nonimmigrant visa services in the country and, hours later, Turkey announced a reciprocal suspension. The U.S. measure was in response to the arrest of U.S. consulate staff member Metin Topuz last week. Topuz, a Turkish national, was arrested and charged with espionage, trying to overthrow Turkeys government and acting against the Turkish Constitution. Turkey believes Topuz has links to Fethullah Gulen, a Turkish cleric living in Pennsylvania whom Turkey accuses of orchestrating a failed military coup in July 2016. \nIn a statement, U.S. Ambassador to Turkey John Bass announced the suspension and said, we have been unable to determine  what if any, evidence exists against [Topuz]. He added, we dont know  if we should expect other Turkish staff members to be arrested for simply speaking to Turkish government officials or the wider Turkish public in the course of their duties.\nThe visa suspensions affect students, business travellers, tourists and diplomats, among others. According to a U.S. official, all current visas remain valid and, while visa services in Turkey are suspended, Turkish citizens can still apply for U.S. visas in other countries. The Turkish Foreign Ministry said its suspension included electronic visas and those purchased at the border. The suspension does not appear to be enforced yet at Turkeys borders, according to The New York Times.\nOn Monday, Turkeys state-run news outletAnadolu Agency said Turkeys Foreign Ministry had summoned the U.S. Deputy Chief of Mission Philip Kosnett, the top U.S. official currently physically present in Turkey, and asked for the U.S. embassy to reverse the suspension. \nRecent disputes\nThe U.S. and Turkey currently disagree on other issues, including:\n\n\tThe attempted military coup against Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoans government in July 2016. Turkey holds Gulen responsible for orchestrating the failed coup. The U.S. has refused to extradite him, with U.S. officials saying the evidence against Gulen is insufficient.\n\tThe war in Syria. The U.S. is allied with the Syrian Kurds against the Islamic State group. Turkey objects to this alliance because the Syrian Kurds are connected to the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) in Turkey. Both the U.S. and Turkey deem the PKK a terrorist organization.\n\nThe U.S. State Department has also been critical of Erdoans government, citing human rights violations and irregularities in the referendum to amend the Turkish Constitution earlier this year. The State Department also cited troubling judicial and law enforcement actions by the Turkish government after it raided the offices of newspapers like Zaman last year and placed them under state control. President Barack Obama, as well as other world leaders, also reportedly expressed concerns about the treatment of more than 6,000 Turkish soldiers arrested in July 2016 on suspicion of plotting the attempted coup.",

      "Content": "California and 16 other states filed a lawsuit against the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on Tuesday over its decision to rescind 2012 emissions standards regulations. The regulations, issued under President Barack Obama, required cars and light-duty trucks made by the year 2025 to have fuel efficiency standards of the equivalent of 54.5 miles per gallon. Earlier this month, EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt announced the standards were not appropriate and later rescinded them.\nThe Model Year (MY) 2022-2025 standards announced in 2012 were then implemented by the EPA in January 2017. The EPA said at the time the greenhouse gas emission standards determination would be subject to further manufacturing and fuel projections, and set an April 2018 deadline to evaluate if the rules were appropriate. \nOn April 2 of this year, the EPA released a statement saying the MY 2022-2025 standards should be revised. Pruitt said, Obamas EPA cut the Midterm Evaluation process short with politically charged expediency, made assumptions about the standards that didnt comport with reality, and set the standards too high. He said the projections on fuel prices were too low and the standards would be detrimental to automakers and car purchasers. \nPruitt announced the start of a joint process with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to propose more appropriate greenhouse gas emission and fuel economy standards, and open them for comment by the general public. \nOn April 13, the EPA revised the MY 2022-2025 emissions standards. A statement from Californias Office of the Attorney General (OAG) said it made the decision arbitrarily and without evidence to support its decision.\nCalifornia Gov. Jerry Brown said while announcing Tuesdays lawsuit, Pollutants coming out of vehicles, out of the tailpipe, does (sic) permanent lung damage to children living near well-traveled roads and freeways. This is a fact. The only way were going to overcome that is by reducing emissions. \nThe other states joining the lawsuit, all with Democratic attorneys general, are: Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Minnesota, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, and the District of Columbia. They represent roughly 44 percent of the national population and about 43 percent of the new car sales market, according to the California OAG.\nThe Clean Power Plan of 2015, which Pruitt signed a proposal to withdraw from last year, calls for the regulation of carbon emissions. A waiver from the act allows California to impose its own standards for vehicle emissions limits, and to make them higher than federal standards. The EPA said in its statement earlier this month that it is reexamining that waiver.\nSources: California OAG, EPA Release, White House Archives, AP, Reuters",

      "Content": "On Thursday, Swedish emergency officials said nearly 100 people had evacuated their homes since Wednesday due to wildfires in the country. In Jmtland, Vsterbotten, Gvleborg and Dalarna counties, authorities advised residents to evacuate multiple villages. Swedish authorities requested international aid and, on Thursday, the Red Cross said it would begin coordinating volunteers to help with evacuations and distribution of supplies and information.\nThomas Aronsson, chief of operations for SITS, a firefighting service in Sweden, said Wednesday: There are 80 fires right now in Sweden, and there is no helicopter company or pilot in all of Sweden that's not involved in fighting them. He added, \"we need tankers, we need helicopters -- we don't have enough supplies.\nItaly has sent two firefighting planes, and Frances civil security service said it was sending three such planes to Sweden on Thursday. Norway, which has wildfires in its territory as well, has sent 10 helicopters to Sweden for firefighting, according to NRK, Norways national broadcaster.\n\"The last time we saw wildfires of this caliber was 12 years ago,\" a rescue officer in Jokkmokk told AFP.\nFires are also burning in Norway, Finland and northwestern Russia, according to Copernicus, the EUs Earth observation program. For a map of fire locations as of 3 p.m. local time on Wednesday, see the Stockholm Fire Departments Facebook post here. \nPatrik Forsgren, a member of Sweden's home guard, said \"It has been very dry this spring and summer. Last weekend, it was thunder and lightning. The lightning started three forest fires. He said firefighters had been trying to stop a fire near Ljusdal in central Sweden since Sunday. He said the fire covered about 35 square miles (91 square kilometers).\nThe Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute said last week, It has been exceptionally dry and hot during May, June and early July. The institute said there was a water shortage risk for nearly all of central and southern Sweden. On Thursday, it said there was a forest fire risk for the majority of the country. \nHigh temperatures in central and southern Sweden have been above 86 degrees Fahrenheit (30 degrees Celsius) and are predicted to continue for about a week, with a low chance of rain, according to CNN. Temperatures are predicted to be 9 to 18 degrees Fahrenheit (5 to 10 degrees Celsius) above average for this time of year.\nSources: BBC, CNN",

      "Content": "A United Nations Fact Finding Mission concluded that Myanmar military officials should be prosecuted for war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide for violence taken against the Rohingya people in Rakhine State, according to a report released on Monday. The mission, created by the U.N. Human Rights Council in March 2017, said the actions undoubtedly amount to the gravest crimes under international law and are similar to other cases in which courts have determined genocidal intent. \nGenocide, according the U.N. definition, occurs when a person commits a prohibited act with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial, or religious group, as such. This would include apply to the Myanmar militarys actions against the Rohingya ethnic group in Rakhine and neighboring states, the U.N. mission said. The report estimated 10,000 Rohingya have been killed, calling the estimate conservative, and estimated nearly 725,000 have fled to Bangladesh. Hundreds of thousands have been displaced within Myanmar, the report said. \nThe Myanmar government denies attacking civilians, and instead says it has only attacked militants it deems as terrorists. In January 2018, the military admitted that soldiers unlawfully killed 10 Bengali terrorists in September. The army will take charge of those who are responsible for the killings and who broke the rules of engagement, the military said. The government had previously said it stopped what it called clearance operations in Rakhine State last year. \nThe U.N. fact-finding mission interviewed 875 witnesses and victims, as well as analyzing satellite imagery and verifying photos and videos as part of its investigation. It outlined allegations of the military killing indiscriminately, gang-raping women, assaulting children, and burning entire villages. The report said this has occurred with legal impunity in the country. \nThe Rohingya are in a continuing situation of severe systemic and institutionalised oppression from birth to death, said the chairman of the investigative mission, Marzuki Darusman. The recent military action against them has shown flagrant disregard for lives and displayed extreme levels of brutality, he added. \nWhile the report focused on the actions of the military, called the Tatmadaw, it also alleged other security agencies were involved. The report names six generals, including the military commander Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, as priority subjects for investigation and prosecution.\nChristopher Sidoti, of the committees three members, called on the U.N. Security Council and General Assembly to take action based on the report. The report recommended the U.N. impose targeted sanctions against individuals believed to be responsible for the crimes, as well as a general arms embargo against the country. \nWe are convinced the international community holds the key to dismantling the destructive veil of impunity in Myanmar, Sidoti said.\nThe U.N. report also recommended that the case be referred to the International Criminal Court (ICC) at The Hague, or said an ad hoc international criminal tribunal could be established, so a competent court can determine [officials] liability for genocide. Myanmar has not signed the Rome Statute, the legislation that created the ICC. As a result, the ICC may not have legal jurisdiction to prosecute Myanmar officials. \nThe report makes other recommendations as well, including calling on the U.N. to create a trust fund for Rohingya victims of the violence to receive psychosocial support, legal aid, livelihood support, and others means of assistance.\nThe Myanmar government has previously denied widespread abuses, and said it has responded to local violence in the area with clearance operations that it says have since stopped. Myanmar also created its own ad hoc court to address the issue, which the U.N. report concluded has not been impartial, independent [or] effective. The report also said, Impunity is deeply entrenched in Myanmars political and legal system, effectively placing the Tatmadaw above the law, citing constitutional protections.\nAlso on Monday, Facebook announced it was removing accounts and pages of certain Myanmar officials from Facebook and Instagram. Specifically, the company said it removed 20 people and organizations followed by 12 million people collectively, including the commander-in-chief of the armed forces and the militarys television network. Facebook said it wanted to prevent them from using our service to further inflame ethnic and religious tensions, and cited the U.N. report that said some of the individuals were responsible for human rights violations. \n\nSources: Al Jazeera, BBC, Facebook, OHCHR Report, The New York Times",

The Senate could vote on Haspels nomination as early as Thursday, according to Senate aides. \nWith five Democrats saying they would vote for Haspel and two Republicans saying they would not, she could be confirmed by more than the minimum 50 votes needed in the Senate, which Republicans control 51-49.\nAmong the five Democrats who have said they would vote for Haspel, Sen. Mark Warner (Va.), the minority leader on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said, I believe she is someone who can and will stand up to the President if ordered to do something illegal or immoral -- like a return to torture. Warner may have been referring to enhanced interrogation techniques such as waterboarding, a type of simulated drowning, that the CIA used after 9/11 and that some have called a form of torture.\nDuring the part of her confirmation hearings open to the public last week, some senators asked Haspel about her time at the CIA when enhanced interrogation techniques were used. In her written responses to senators questions, Haspel wrote that the enhanced interrogation program is not one the CIA should have undertaken and that the U.S. must be an example to the rest of the world.\nSens. Rand Paul (Ky.) and John McCain (Ariz.) are two Republicans who have said they oppose Haspels nomination. Sen. John Flake (R-Ariz.) said he is undecided. \nMcCain is unlikely to attend the vote for health reasons. After Haspels public confirmation hearing, McCain wrote that her refusal to acknowledge tortures immorality is disqualifying.\nSen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.), the committees chairman, said Haspel was the most qualified person for the position and that she has acted morally, ethically, and legally, over a distinguished 30-year career.\nSources: CNN, The Washington Post",

      "Content": "Boris Johnson resigned as the British foreign secretary on Monday, saying he could not in all conscience champion an agreement reached Friday by the cabinet on the U.K.s exit from the EU. Two other U.K. members of parliament also resigned from ministerial positions on Sunday, saying they did not support the agreement. U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May said the agreement would honor the result of the referendum to leave the EU.\nAt Fridays meeting, called Chequers after the prime ministers country estate where discussions took place, the cabinet approved a vision for a relationship with the EU that it said works for both sides, underpinning shared prosperity and security. \nFollowing the agreement, David Davis resigned as Secretary of State for Exiting the EU and Steve Baker resigned as a minister in the same department on Sunday. Johnson, who campaigned to leave the union before the 2016 referendum, then resigned as foreign secretary, saying that the agreement did not represent the interests of the British people. \nThe U.K. and the EU have not negotiated a final agreement on aspects of the U.K.s exit from the union, which is planned for March 29, 2019. The deadline for this agreement was set when the U.K. initiated exit proceedings under Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. Among the issues to be negotiated are trade agreements, financial obligations, adherence to regulatory standards for goods and customs, and residency of EU citizens in the U.K. and vice versa.\nMay said the Chequers agreement resulted from \"productive discussions,\" and would give the U.K. control of its borders, law and money, in accordance with the referendum to leave the EU. The U.K. voted 51.89 to 48.11 percent in favor of leaving the union. May, who had initially supported the campaign to remain in the EU, took over the prime ministership in July 2016 when David Cameron, who also supported remaining in the union, resigned.\n\nChequers agreement\nThe government released a statement on the preliminary agreement, which was reached after a 12-hour meeting, that said the U.K. and EU would:\n\n\tEstablish a free trade area for goods.\n\tMaintain a common rulebook for all goods, by harmoniz[ing] with EU rules. Parliament would have the ability to incorporate these rules into U.K. law and the ability to choose not to.\n\tEstablish strong reciprocal commitments related to open and fair trade, such as state aid and regulatory standards for environment, climate change, employment, and consumer protection.\n\tCreate a joint institutional framework to provide for the consistent interpretation and application of UK-EU agreements by both parties, through U.K. and EU courts and with regard to EU case law.\n\tIntroduce a Facilitated Customs Arrangement that would remove the need for customs checks and controls between the U.K. and EU, as if they were a combined customs territory.\n\nThe government announced on Friday it would publish a white paper with details of the proposal the following week. \nResignations\nJohnson, who had served as the Foreign Secretary since June 2016, outlined the reasons for his resignation in a letter that he posted on Twitter. In it, he said the U.K. was headed for the status of colony, and criticized aspects of the Chequers agreement, above all that involved accepting that the U.K. would not be able to pass laws independently from the EU, and in the interests of the people of the U.K. \nIn a letter accepting Johnsons resignation, May wrote, the agreement we reached on Friday marks the point where that is no longer the case and if you are not able to provide the support we need to secure this deal in the interests of the United Kingdom, it is right that you should step down. May said in a statement to the House of Commons that she wanted to recognize Johnsons passion  in promoting a global Britain to the world as the country leaves the EU. \nJeremy Hunt, who was the Health Secretary, was named as Johnsons replacement later on Monday, and Matt Hancock was named the new Health Secretary. \nDavis, who resigned as the Secretary of State for Exiting the EU, had been appointed to the position in 2016. He said Sunday that the best person to be Secretary is someone who really believes in the Chequers agreement, not him. Following his resignation, Dominic Raab, who had been the housing minister, was promoted to the EU secretary position. May said she wanted to recognize Davis work to steer through parliament some of the most important legislation for generations. \nBaker, who resigned as under-secretary in the Department for Exiting the EU said he would not be able to represent the Chequers policy as my own policy and therefore I cant be in the government. He said he had working on a White Paper for the exit from the EU that did not accord with what was put to the cabinet at Chequers on Friday.\nDonald Tusk, the president of the European council, said the British cabinet resignations did nothing to solve the mess caused by Brexit, the colloquial name for the British exit from the EU. The European Commission declined to comment to the BBC.\n\nSources: Johnson resignation, Chequers statement, BBC, BBC, BBC, BBC, BBC, BBC, The Guardian",

The 32 charges, which were released on Thursday, include filing false tax returns, failure to report on foreign accounts, and bank fraud. Gates pleaded guilty on Friday afternoon to federal conspiracy and false-statements charges in Washington.\nThese charges are part of Muellers investigation into alleged Russian efforts to influence the 2016 presidential election and related matters.\nThe 37-page indictment alleges that Manafort, with the help of Gates, laundered more than $30 million, concealing it from the Treasury and Justice Departments. The document alleges more than $75 million was channeled through offshore accounts in Cyprus, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and the Seychelles. The charge of bank fraud can carry a sentence of up to 30 years in prison and a fine of as much as $1 million.\nThis weeks indictment adds to the 12 charges that Muellers investigation already filed against Manafort and Gates in October of last year. Those charges were filed in the District of Columbia. The new charges were filed in the Eastern District of Virginia. Muellers investigators reportedly told Manafort and Gates that they could defend the new charges in Washington, and, according to CNN, Manafort declined. \nManafort and Gates allegedly acted as unregistered agents of foreign governments and political parties, specifically the government of then Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, according to the previous charges against the two men. The indictment alleges that they did not pay taxes on tens of millions of dollars earned from the Ukraine work. \nManafort pleaded not guilty to the charges from last October. Gates initially pleaded not guilty last year. Then on Friday, Gates signed a plea deal that admitted to two charges: conspiracy against the United States, relating to seven counts from the October indictment on conspiring to obstruct the Justice and Treasury departments, and the charge of false statement, for making willful misrepresentations to the FBI. The deal said he would cooperate fully, truthfully, completely, and forthrightly with the special counsels office.\nManafort has not entered a plea for the new charges. His lawyer released a statement saying he is innocent and confident that he will be acquitted of all charges. After Gates plea, Manafort said it does not alter my commitment to defend myself against the untrue piled up charges contained in the indictments against me.\nManafort filed a lawsuit in January against Mueller alleging the investigation exceeded the scope of its authority, as the charges brought against Manafort and Gates relate to work from before joining the Trump campaign. \n\nSources: Indictment, Plea, AP, CNN, Fox News",

The troops were sent to the town of Marana, northwest of Tucson, according to Duceys spokesperson, Patrick Ptak. Ducey said on Twitter that additional National Guard members would be deployed Tuesday. \nLast week, President Donald Trump said, Until we can have a wall and proper security, were going to be guarding our border with the military. On Friday, Defense Secretary James Mattis signed a memo approving U.S. Department of Defense funding through September for up to 4,000 troops along the border. The troops will be armed only in circumstances that might require self-defense, and will not perform law enforcement activities or interact with migrants without Mattis approval, according to the department memo. They will assist Border Patrol agents with supporting tasks, according to Politico.\nThe Arizona deployment is scheduled for 31 days, with the possibility of extension, and will be paid with federal funds, according to Ptak.\nAlso on Friday, the Texas Army National Guard said 250 guardsmen would be deployed to the U.S.-Mexico border in the following 72 hours. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said he would commit at least 1,000 guardsmen. The guardsmen were to bring aircraft, vehicles and surveillance equipment with them, according to Reuters.\nNew Mexico Gov. Susana Martinezs office said it would be deploying 250 guardsmen, including 80 later this week. None have yet been deployed. \nCalifornia has not decided whether or not to send its National Guard troops to support border control. California National Guard spokesman Lt. Col. Tom Keegan said last week that the request would be promptly reviewed to determine how best we can assist our federal partners.\nSources: DoD Press Release, AP, NBC News, Politico, Reuters, USA Today",

      "Content": "On Sunday, South Korean officials seized the KOTI, a ship suspected of violating U.N. sanctions by transferring oil to a North Korean ship. A South Korean maritime office said security officials had prohibited the ship, which was sailing under a Panamanian flag, from leaving the port of Pyeongtaek-Dangjin on Dec. 21, South Koreas Yonhap news agency reported. The countrys Foreign Ministry said an investigation of the KOTI was underway. \nThe majority of the KOTIs crew is reportedly from China and Myanmar (Burma). According to CNN, the KOTI can carry 5,100 metric tons of oil. Densities of crude oil and refined petroleum products vary; 5,100 metric tons could correspond, for instance, to about 43,000 barrels of gasoline. A Dec. 22 U.N. resolution limited refined petroleum exports to North Korea to 500,000 barrels per year.\nOn Friday, South Korea had announced it had seized a ship called the Lighthouse Winmore, which was registered in Hong Kong. The same Dec. 22 resolution allowed member states to seize ships suspected of trading oil and other U.N.-prohibited items with North Korea. The South Korean Foreign Ministry said it suspects the Lighthouse Winmore performed a ship-to-ship transfer of about 600 tons of refined petroleum products to a North Korean vessel in the East China Sea on Oct. 19. A Taiwanese company, the Billions Bunker Group, was leasing the Lighthouse Winmore during the alleged illegal petroleum transfer.\nThe Associated Press reported that officials are holding and investigating 23 Chinese nationals and two Myanmar nationals from the Lighthouse Winmore in Yeosu, South Korea. According to a South Korean customs official, customs interviewed members of that ships crew on Nov. 24. \nReuters reported the U.S. requested this month that the U.N. ban the Lighthouse Winmore and nine other ships from international waters due to alleged illicit trade with North Korea. The KOTI was not one of those 10 ships.\nThe Dec. 22 U.N. resolution was the third since Sept. 11 that implemented sanctions on North Korea for its intercontinental ballistic missile and nuclear programs. The Sept. 11 resolution prohibited ship-to-ship trade of prohibited items with North Korea. \nSouth Korean media reported last week that the U.S. photographed 30 instances of Chinese ships allegedly transferring oil to North Korean ships, in violation of U.N. sanctions. The Chinese foreign ministry said, the Chinese government has been completely and strictly enforcing Security Council resolutions.\nSources: CNN, Fox News",

      "Content": "Whats the difference between 'tax avoidance' and 'tax evasion'?\nThe U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) uses the following definitions; other countries may make different distinctions between the two activities:\n\n\tTax avoidance: minimizing taxes using methods approved by the IRS, such as business expense deductions. Tax avoidance lessens ones tax liability.\n\tTax evasion: not paying taxes or deliberately underpaying taxes by not reporting all income earned. Tax evasion is considered illegal in the U.S.\n\nWhy is tax evasion illegal?\nTaxes contribute to a countrys revenue, and help to fund government programs or reduce a countrys deficit. The lower the tax income, the less revenue a country receives. Since income is taxed, underreporting ones income, a form of tax evasion, may negatively affect a countrys tax revenue.\nA 2012 report by the Tax Justice Network, an advocacy group, estimated that about $21 to $32 trillion in worldwide wealth is unreported and therefore not taxed.\nThe IRS estimates the U.S. loses about $458 billion in tax revenue annually due to the underreporting of business income. A high level of voluntary tax compliance remains critical to help ensure taxpayer faith and fairness in the tax system. Those who dont pay what they owe ultimately shift the tax burden to those who properly meet their tax obligations, says the IRS.\nA 2017 report by the EU studied the link between offshore activities and money laundering. The report found that about US$1.5 to $2.8 trillion, or between 2 percent and 5 percent of the worldwide GDP, is lost annually through money laundering. The report based its findings on some of the information disclosed in the Panama Papers.\nHow have governments addressed the misuse of offshore accounts?\nSince offshore accounts may contain unreported revenue, governments around the world have worked to curtail the misuse of such accounts. Below are a few examples of such efforts.\nIn 2010, former U.S. President Barack Obama signed the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) into law to combat tax evasion. FATCA requires certain foreign institutions to report on the foreign assets held by their U.S. account holders, or be subject to penalties.\nIn 2016, Obama announced changes to the Treasury Department to address tax evasion:\n\n\tThe Customer Due Diligence rule requires financial institutions, such as banks and mutual funds, to verify who owns and profits from the companies that make use of their services. If a company opens an account at a financial institution, that institution is required to identify and verify the people behind that company. Obama said this rule gives financial institutions and law enforcement the ability to identify assets and accounts that may be used by criminals and national security threats.\n\tThe Treasury must require certain foreign-owned companies based in the U.S. to obtain a tax identification number from the IRS to help report and track ownership and transaction information.\n\nA report posted on Medium reviewed the actions taken by various governments one year after the Panama Papers were released. It said 70 countries launched at least 150 investigations or audits on the people and corporations linked to the Panama Papers, which resulted in the recovery of about $110 million in unpaid taxes or asset seizures.\nThe EU has also recommended a few steps its members can take to curtail tax evasion via offshore accounts, such as sanctioning those who violate tax evasion rules, or encouraging compliance by offering incentives for reporting on offshore income and assets. The EU also suggested using new encryption technologies that may allow for information sharing between financial institutions and EU member states, without breaching confidentiality rules.",

      "Content": "What are driverless and autonomous vehicles?\nThere are various types of autonomous and semi-autonomous vehicle technology in existence and development. Terms such as driverless, self-driving, automated and autonomous are often used to describe cars requiring little to no driver involvement. But which is which?\nAccording to the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), vehicles can be categorized into six automation levels.\n\n\tNo automation: The driver performs all driving tasks.\n\tDriver assistance: The driver controls the vehicle, which might contain some driving-assist features such as power steering or braking/accelerating control mechanisms.\n\tPartial automation: The vehicle contains combined automated functions that can control both steering and braking/acceleration, for example, but the driver must maintain all other driving functions and monitor the vehicles performance.\n\tConditional automation: The vehicle can perform all driving tasks using an Automated Driving System (ADS) under certain conditions, but the driver must be present to take back control when other circumstances arise.\n\tHigh automation: The vehicles ADS can perform driving tasks and monitor driving conditions. Certain circumstances may require driver assistance, but it is not necessary for the vehicle to function.\n\tFull automation: The vehicles ADS can perform all driving tasks under any driving condition. A person in the driver seat may act as a passenger.\n\nThe NHTSA considers the current level of commercially available vehicle automation to be at partial automation, although several automotive and technology companies are developing and testing vehicles with higher levels of automation. The NHTSA estimated that the transportation industry may have fully automated cars by 2025.\nPartially automated vehicles can come with several automated features such as lane-keeping assistance, which helps a vehicle stay within traffic lanes unless the blinker is activated; adaptive cruise control, which helps the vehicle maintain driving speeds; automated braking; which activates the brakes on the vehicle if an object such as a pedestrian is detected in front of the car while driving; and automated parking that uses cameras and sensors, along with steering, acceleration and braking technology, to park a car.\nWhat is the automation development process?\nBefore a fully autonomous car can be developed, technology and auto companies must create compatible autonomous solutions. And since autonomous vehicles may require testing on roads under real-world conditions, the developers and manufacturers often need permission from countries or cities to test their products.\nAt the 2018 Consumer Electronics Show, several car companies announced partnerships with technology companies working toward automation. For example, technology company AImotive, which utilizes cameras and sensors to develop proprietary self-driving solutions, has partnered with Volvo and received autonomous testing licenses in countries such as Hungary, France and California.\nA side effect of this development process is the occasional self-driving car accident, which is partly why companies may require approval to test their vehicles on public roads. For example, in 2016, a Tesla Model S Sedan driving in auto-pilot mode crashed into the back of a cleaning vehicle, killing the driver. That same year, one of Googles self-driving cars hit a municipal bus while merging in Mountain View, California, resulting in no injuries. And in March 2018, one of Ubers cars with a self-driving system hit a pedestrian crossing the street outside of the boundaries of a crosswalk, killing the pedestrian.\nWhat are the pros of autonomous vehicles?\nSince fully autonomous vehicles are still being developed and vehicles with partially autonomous modes arent widely available to consumers, the benefits of such technology are speculative. Below are some benefits presented by the NHTSA and other organizations.\n\n\tSafety: Autonomous vehicles use computers and sensors to determine distance and speed, and can adjust them in relation to other cars or objects on the road. About 94 percent of car crashes are the result of human error, according to the NHTSA. If automated vehicles can reduce human errors, then it may also reduce human error-related car crashes. \n\tCost savings: Fewer accidents may also mean lower healthcare and insurance costs. A 2010 NHTSA study showed car crashes cost $242 billion in economic activity, including $57.6 billion in lost workplace productivity, and $594 billion due to loss of life and decreased quality of life due to injuries. \n\tTime savings: As noted by the Auto Insurance Center, an auto news and information website, if people dont have to concentrate on driving, they could spend that time doing other activities as they travel.\n\tEfficiency: NHTSA estimated that if the majority of cars on the road operated autonomously, they might cooperate to reduce traffic congestion. A study by consulting firm McKinsey estimated that transportation made up of majority-autonomous vehicles could reduce daily average travel time by 50 minutes.\n\tMobility: Self-driving cars may provide mobility to people who cannot drive due to injury, age, or other factors. A study by the Ruderman Foundation suggested that autonomous cars could help approximately 2 million individuals with disabilities have better access to employment, and fewer missed medical appointments. The study said that of the 57 million people living with a disability in the U.S., about six million of those individuals have difficulty accessing transportation.\n\nWhat are the cons of autonomous vehicles?\nEmerging technology can sometimes have initial costs out of reach to the average consumer, and something as fundamental as transportation may require government intervention. Below are some of the cons of self-driving cars.\n\n\tA learning curve: People would have to be taught how to operate and manage an autonomous vehicle, and potentially how to troubleshoot issues that may arise.\n\tInitial cost: The engineering, power and computer requirements, software, and sensors add up to more than $100,000, according to the Auto Insurance Center, which may be unaffordable for most consumers. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the median household income in the U.S. for 2016 was $59,039 a year.\n\tOpt-in requirement: As noted in the pros section, most safety and time-saving benefits are based on a scenario in which most vehicles on the road are automated. If most people ultimately dont opt to own and operate an autonomous vehicle, the risk of human error while driving would still exist.\n\tEmployment: The transportation industry currently employs over five million people in the U.S., according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, including industries providing transportation of passengers and cargo, sightseeing transportation, and support activities related to modes of transportation. If some those vehicles become automated, that may require people to seek employment elsewhere.\n\tLiability: If a car accident does occur, a court or legal authority may have to determine who is at fault: the owner of the vehicle or its manufacturer.\n\tRoad limitations: While autonomous cars can detect traffic lights, they cannot currently detect, for example, traffic cops manually directing traffic during power outages, accidents or other issues. And autonomous cars may not be able to factor in region-specific traffic laws. For example, the legality of turning right when the traffic light is red may vary by state or city.\n\nThe NHTSA is also currently reviewing the potential cyber security risks of vehicle automation. Systems and components that govern safety must be protected from harmful attacks, unauthorized access, damage, or anything else that might interfere with safety functions, the NHTSA noted. \nThe NHTSA encourages the autonomous vehicle industry to adopt certain practices it claims would improve the cybersecurity posture of their vehicles.\nWhich companies are developing autonomous vehicles?\nSeveral automotive, transportation and technology companies are developing autonomous cars or associated technology. Below are a few examples.\nFord plans to have fully autonomous vehicles, as defined by the NHTSA, available for ride-sharing services by 2021. The company said its vehicles would operate without a steering wheel, gas pedal or brake pedal. The company plans to work with several technology companies to develop radar technology, 3D mapping, and camera sensors to achieve its goal. According to media site TechWorld, Ford has been testing autonomous cars for 10 years.\nMercedes-Benz, through its parent company Daimler, has been granted permission from the U.S., China and Germany to test its self-driving technology. The company has a goal to put the first driverless robot taxis on the road in the early 2020s.\nVolkswagen recently partnered with FDTech, which develops autonomous driving systems. Although the companies didnt give an exact timeframe for releasing their autonomous cars, Karsten Schulze, CEO and co-founder of FDTech, said, We want to make driverless vehicles available to everyone everywhere.\nRide-sharing service Uber has been working on autonomous driving technology since 2015. It has partnered with automotive companies such as Toyota and Daimler. Uber launched its first self-driving vehicle pilot program in Pittsburgh in 2016. Companies such as Lyft and Google are also developing autonomous vehicles for ride-sharing applications.\n\nSources: AImotive, Auto Insurance Center, BLS, DigitalTrends, Ford, Google, Lyft, McKinsey, Mercedes-Benz, NHTSA, NHTSA Cyber Security, Ruderman Foundation, TechWorld, Uber, U.S. Census Bureau, Volkswagen",

The U.K.-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said at least 23 people were killed in the attacks. Israeli Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman said Israel had destroyed nearly all of Irans military infrastructure in Syria. Syria said its air defenses had destroyed a large part of the incoming missiles. \nIsrael Defense Forces (IDF) spokesman Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus said fighter jets had hit 70 Iranian military targets. Targets reportedly included intelligence sites, logistics headquarters for Iranian Quds Forces, Quds Force munition storage warehouses at Damascus International Airport, a military logistics compound in a town south of Damascus, a military compound north of Damascus, and observation and military posts in the Golan demilitarized zone. The IDF said it also attacked Syrian air defense systems after they fired on Israeli fighter jets.\nEarly Thursday morning, Iranian forces in Syria fired about 20 rockets at Israeli forces in the Golan Heights, according to the IDF. Israel said it intercepted four rockets and that the others fell in Syrian territory. Prior to the attacks on Thursday, Israel had bombed parts of southern Syria. In April, Israeli jets bombed an airbase in Syria, killing seven Iranian troops, BBC reported.\nIran has deployed hundreds of military advisors to Syria during the countrys civil war, and has trained thousands of militiamen in support of Syrian government forces, according to BBC.\nAfter Thursdays attacks, Lieberman said, If there is rain on our side, there will be a flood on their side. He added, I hope we finished this chapter and everyone got the message. He said Israel does not want a further escalation of attacks between it and Iranian forces.\nA Syrian spokesman said Israeli missiles killed three people, and that a radar station and munitions depot had been destroyed. He said some air defense bases had been damaged. \nRussia said Israel had fired 60 missiles from fighter jets and 10 from the ground. It said more than half the missiles were shot down.\nMikhail Bogdanov, a Russian deputy foreign minister, called for restraint from all parties, according to Russian news agency Interfax.

British authorities determined that Skripal was poisoned with Novichok, a military-grade nerve agent, and that it was highly likely that Russia was responsible for the attack. Russia denied the allegation. Russian President Vladimir Putin said of Skripal, I wish him good health, we are very happy, actually.\nPutin also said, Thank God [Skripal] recovered and that he left [the hospital]. Putin made his remarks while visiting German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Germany. He said, If a military-grade poisonous substance had been used, as our British colleagues claim, this person would have died right there on the spot. Putin said military-grade poison kills in seconds or minutes. \nLast month, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) confirmed Novichok was used in the attack on the Skripals. The Soviet Union developed Novichok during the 1970s and 80s. British police said in March that of all of the sites they examined, they had identified the highest concentration of Novichok on the front door of Skripals home. \nPutin also said, We have several times offered our British partners any necessary assistance in the investigation (of the poisoning). So far we have received no response. Our offer remains open.\nThe U.K. expelled 23 Russian diplomats in response to the poisoning. More than 20 countries expelled diplomats in response to the attack, including the U.S. In response, Russia announced it would expel 60 U.S. diplomats and 90 diplomats from the other countries that had expelled its diplomats.\nSergei Skripals daughter, Yulia, was released from the hospital last month. \nSources: AFP, CNN",

The government also closed three newspapers, a TV channel and 12 non-governmental organizations. Turkey has been under a state of emergency since a failed coup in July 2016. \nThe decree also annulled the ranks of 1,500 retired military and police officers, cancelling their passports and pensions. The decree additionally reinstated 148 people who had been previously been fired as a result of earlier emergency decrees.\nSince the coup attempt, the government has dismissed more than 125,000 people and jailed 160,000, according to BBC. Some Western countries have criticized the arrests as ways of reducing dissent. Turkey has said its emergency measures have been necessary to maintain national security.\nThe current state of emergency is set to expire on July 18 if the president does not extend it. Erdoan has said he would end it.\nErdoan is due to be sworn in again as president on Monday, after he was re-elected with 53 percent of the vote last month. In April, he called for early elections. He will have new powers once he is sworn in, resulting from a referendum last year that approved constitutional changes, including abolishing the prime ministers position and reducing the powers of parliament, which Erdoans AKP party controls. He will also be able to appoint ministers and vice-presidents, and choose a greater number of senior judges.

      "Content": "The Hawaii County Civil Defense agency announced Monday evening that the Big Islands Kilauea lava flow had begun moving toward the Puna Geothermal Venture (PGV) power plant, which contributes 38 megawatts of power to the island.\nPGV uses hot liquid and steam from underground wells to move turbine generators that create electricity for sale to the states utility, Hawaii Electric Light Company. After the volcano began erupting on May 3, the company shut down the wells, which run about 6,000 to 8,000 feet deep, and removed about 60,000 gallons of the flammable chemical pentane from the site.\nCounty, state, and federal partners have been collaborating closely to monitor the situation and work with PGV to ensure the safety of the surrounding communities, the Hawaiian civil defense agency said. Ten of the eleven wells have been quenched. Efforts are ongoing to make sure the site is secure and the community is kept safe.\nHawaii's Emergency Management Agency chief, Tom Travis, explained that quenching refers to filling the underground wells full of cold water so that the weight of the cold water sitting in the pipe is sufficient [so] that instead of hot water entering the bottom of the well, cold water exits the bottom of the well. Travis noted that once the quenching is complete, the power plant will be in a much more solid state for having lava overflow the site, if lava reaches PGV. He also said workers might plug the wells with mud and cap them with iron plugs to prevent possible explosions or the release of toxic gases such as hydrogen sulfate.\nSince Kilauea began erupting earlier this month, it has burned approximately 40 buildings, including homes, and about 2,000 people have been evacuated. Over the weekend, the lava flow entered the Pacific Ocean, creating a white plume containing hydrochloric acid and fine particles of glass. Officials have given affected residents on the Big Island particulate masks that filter ash to aid in breathing, CNN reported.\nThe state closed about two-thirds of Hawaiis Volcanoes National Park on May 11. According to a report published by the National Park Service (NPS) last month, the park has had a 58 percent increase in visitors since 2008. In 2017, the park had a total of 2,016,702 visitors, which NPS said contributed to $166 million spent in communities near the park.\nSources: CBS News, CNN, NPR, Reuters",

      "Content": "An Iranian oil tanker collided with a Chinese freight ship late Saturday, causing the tanker to catch fire and oil to spill into the East China Sea, Chinese authorities said. All 32 of the tankers crew members are missing. The head of Irans Ports and Maritime Organization, Mohammad Rastad, said bad weather conditions and the fire on and around the ship were adversely affecting the rescue operation.\nThe Panama-registered tanker, owned by the National Iranian Tanker Co., was carrying Iranian oil en route to South Korea when it collided with the Chinese ship 160 miles (257 km) off the coast of Shanghai, according to Chinas Ministry of Transport. The Chinese ship, the CF Crystal, received non-critical damage and all 21 of its crew members are accounted for, according to the Chinese Ministry of Transportation.\nChina dispatched four police boats to search for the missing crew and three cleaning ships to the scene as of 9:00 am local time on Sunday morning, the ministry said. South Korea also dispatched a ship and a helicopter to aid in the operation. The fire was still burning as of 1:00 pm local time, according to a South Korean coast guard official.\nThe tanker was carrying 136,000 metric tonnes (150,000 tons, or almost 1 million barrels) of a type of light crude called condensate, Chinese authorities said. According to Reuters, that amount is worth about $60 million, based on global crude prices. Chinese authorities have not provided details about the size of the spill. It was not known if the tanker is continuing to leak, The Associated Press reported on Sunday. \nThe cause of the accident has not been determined, according to AP.\nSources: AP, Reuters",

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced the 18-month extension on Wednesday. Under the extension, new Syrian immigrants will not be able to apply for TPS.\nTPS allows immigrants to work in the U.S. and gives them temporary relief from deportation if conditions in their home countries are deemed unsafe. DHS first granted the TPS designation to Syria in 2012, about a year into its ongoing civil war. Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said the department is granting the extension because the conditions still exist in Syria that qualify it for the designation. \nCurrent TPS protections were due to end in two months. The DHS said it would evaluate and make a new decision about TPS status for Syrians after the 18-month extension expires.\nEligibility for the TPS extension requires that the Syrians have continuously lived in the U.S. since Aug. 1, 2016. and have remained physically present in the country since Oct. 1, 2016. This will be the first time since 2012 that the U.S. will not allow new applicants from Syria.\nSources: ABC News, CNN",

      "Content": "On Monday, President Donald Trump tweeted that Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters (Calif.) had called for harm to his supporters. He was referencing a public speech she made on Saturday, in which she told her audience to create a crowd and push back on Trumps Cabinet members when they are visible in public places, such as restaurants. \n \n Last week, people approached Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen in a Mexican restaurant to protest minors separated from the adults they are traveling with, when those immigrants are caught crossing the border illegally as the result of the U.S. zero-tolerance policy on illegal immigration. Last Friday, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said she was asked to leave a restaurant in Virginia because she works for Trump. \nOn Tuesday, government officials confirmed 2,342 immigrant children have been separated from alleged parent guardians since last month. \nWaters statements\nIf you see anybody from [Trumps] Cabinet in a restaurant, in a department store, at a gasoline station, you get out and you create a crowd, Waters said on Saturday at a rally in Los Angeles. And you push back on them. And you tell them they're not welcome anymore, anywhere. We've got to get the children connected to their parents. She was referring to the issue of minors being separated from adults at the border. \nIn an interview with MSNBC later that day, Waters said, The people are going to turn on [members of the administration]. They're going to protest. They're going to absolutely harass them until they decide that they're going to tell the President, 'No, I can't hang with you.\nTrumps tweet\nTrumps Monday tweet read: Congresswoman Maxine Waters, an extraordinarily low IQ person, has become, together with Nancy Pelosi, the Face of the Democrat Party. She has just called for harm to supporters, of which there are many, of the Make America Great Again movement. Be careful what you wish for Max!\nWaters statements referred to Trumps cabinet, not supporters of Trump's movement.\nOn Monday night, in another interview with MSNBC, Waters specified that she believes in peaceful protest, civil protest and freedom of speech, and did not call for harm or violence. She called the president a liar. She said Trump calls everybody names and cited some statements in which Trump has spoken about violence, including saying Id like to punch him in the face. Waters said she was focused on the children who had been separated. \nOther politicians responses \nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) tweeted on Monday, In the crucial months ahead, we must strive to make America beautiful again. Trumps daily lack of civility has provoked responses that are predictable but unacceptable. As we go forward, we must conduct elections in a way that achieves unity from sea to shining sea.\nOn the Senate floor, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said, If you disagree with a politician, organize your fellow citizens to action, and vote them out of office, but no one should call for the harassment of political opponents, that's not right, that's not American.\nHouse Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said Waters should apologize to the American public. We need civility in this country but the idea that you're asking people to go forward, that becomes very dangerous and it becomes a risk inside our country as well, he said.\nRep. Adriano Espaillat (D-N.Y.) commented on the situation in an interview on CNN on Monday. To get sidetracked into these debates about whether or not somebody was welcome at a restaurant takes our eyes off of what's going on in America today, Espaillat said. He added that Maxine Waters is entitled to her opinion and I respect that.\nSources: Maxine Waters Video 06/23, CNN, Fox News, NBC News, Politico",

      "Content": "Police have arrested Joseph James DeAngelo, a former police officer, on two counts of murder, according to the Sacramento district attorneys office. DeAngelo is alleged to be the so-called Golden State Killer, a suspect believed to have murdered 12 people, raped 45 and burglarized more than 120 homes between 1976 and 1986, according to the FBI. \nThe FBI said the suspect raped his first victim in June 1976. His rape and murder victims ranged from 13 to 41 years old and included women at home alone, women at home with their children, and husbands and wives, according to the FBI. \nSacramento District Attorney Anne Marie Schubert said DNA evidence had been used to identify DeAngelo, 72, as the suspect. DeAngelo worked as a police officer in Auburn, California, from August 1976 to September 1979, according to the Auburn city manager. \nThe FBI was searching DeAngelos home in Citrus Heights on Wednesday, where public records showed he has lived since 1983. Citrus Heights is about 16 miles northeast of Sacramento.\nThe Golden State Killer is also known as the \"East Area Rapist and the Original Night Stalker.\" Originally, these were believed to have been different people, but later authorities identified them as the same perpetrator.\nThe crimes were the subject of a book researched and partially written by Michelle McNamara called, Ill Be Gone in the Dark: One Womans Obsessive Search for the Golden State Killer. Her husband, comedian Patton Oswalt, had the book completed and published after McNamara passed away in 2016.\n\nNote: A previous version of this story inaccurately stated that Ventura County police made the arrest. Police in Sacramento County announced the arrest.\nSources: ABC News, CNN, Fox News, The Mercury News, The New York Times, The Sacramento Bee",

Muoz had been apprehended on May 11 for attempting illegal entry into the U.S., according to a CBP spokesperson. The cause of death was listed as suicide by self-strangulation and hanging on May 13, according to a report by the Texas attorney general. \nOn May 11, Muoz, 39, his wife and 3-year old son were apprehended by the Weslaco, Texas, Border Patrol station after attempting illegal entry from Mexico into the U.S. They were taken to the Rio Grande Valley Central Processing Center and, while there, Muoz became disruptive and combative, according to the CBP spokesperson. The Los Angeles Times and The Washington Post both cited an anonymous border agent who said Muoz became upset after he was told the family would be separated. \nWhen immigrants enter the U.S. illegally, the current Department of Homeland Security (DHS) policy may result in children being separated from adults they are traveling with, as reported previously. Specifically, on April 7, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced a zero-tolerance policy for immigrants illegally entering the U.S. On May 7, Sessions announced the DHS would refer 100 percent of illegal Southwest Border crossings to the Department of Justice for prosecution. He also said, If you are smuggling a child, then we will prosecute you and that child will be separated from you as required by law. \nChildren are prohibited from being put in criminal jails, The Washington Post reported; adults who are prosecuted may be separated from children who are accompanying them.\nMuoz was transferred to the Starr County Jail on May 12. The attorney generals report said he was combative and noncompliant at the jail. Muoz was placed in a padded jail cell at about 10:47 p.m., according to the Starr County Jails incident report. Officers at the jail checked on Muoz every 30 minutes during the night shift and there was a camera in his cell. During the morning shift, beginning at 8:00 a.m., detention officers checked on Muoz, and the next time the officers checked, they found him unresponsive in his cell, according to the incident report. He was declared dead around 10 a.m., according to the attorney generals report. \nThe Post cited a border agent who said Muozs wife and son have been released from custody.\nCBP is conducting an internal review and the Texas Rangers are leading the investigation into Muozs death.\nSources: Incident Report, AP, CNN, Los Angeles Times, The Guardian, The New York Times",

      "Content": "On Wednesday, the European Commission ordered Google to pay a $5 billion (4.34 billion euro) fine for breaching EU antitrust rules by imposing certain restrictions on manufacturers of Android phones. The Commission ordered the company to end its illegal practices within 90 days or possibly face future penalties. Google announced it would appeal the ruling, saying, Android has created more choice for everyone, not less.\nSince 2011, Google has imposed illegal restrictions on Android device manufacturers and mobile network operators to cement its dominant position in general internet search, the Commission said. \nThe Commission said Google had imposed three types of restrictions on Android devices including that it:\n\n\trequired manufacturers to pre-install its search and browser apps, Search and Chrome, as a condition for licensing Google Play;\n\tmade payments to certain large manufacturers and mobile network operators on condition that they exclusively pre-installed the Google Search app on their devices; and\n\tprevented manufacturers wishing to pre-install Google apps from selling any smart mobile device running on alternative versions of Android that were not approved by Google (so-called Android forks).\n\nThe Commission said the second practice above regarding payments for pre-installation of Google Search effectively ceased as of 2014, after the Commission started to look into the issue in 2013.\nIf Google does not end the above practices, the Commission said it could face daily fines up to 5 percent of parent-company Alphabets average daily global sales. Alphabets total global sales were $110.9 billion in 2017, Bloomberg reported. \nWhile the case is under appeal, Google must place the potential fine money in a holding account. If the appeal fails, the money would get disbursed to the European Union member states, according to The New York Times. The company has cash reserves of $102.9 billion, Reuters reported.\nEU Commissioner for competition Margrethe Vestager tweeted, Fine of 4,34 bn to @Google for 3 types of illegal restrictions on the use of Android. In this way it has cemented the dominance of its search engine. Denying rivals a chance to innovate and compete on the merits. Its illegal under EU antitrust rules. @Google now has to stop it.\nGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai said in response to the ruling that it rejects the business model that supports Android, which has created more choice for everyone, not less. \nSo far, the Android business model has meant that we haven't had to charge phone makers for our technology, or depend on a tightly controlled distribution model, he said.\nPichai said that in 2007, Google chose to offer Android for free to phone makers and mobile network operators and added that Google has invested billions of dollars over the last decade to make Android what it is today.\nPhone makers dont have to include our services; and theyre also free to pre-install competing apps alongside ours, Pichai said. If you prefer other appsor browsers, or search enginesto the preloaded ones, you can easily disable or delete them, and choose other apps instead. He added that last year, browsers such as Opera Mini and Firefox have been downloaded more than 100 million times, [and] UC Browser more than 500 million times.\nAccording to International Data Corporation (IDC), about 1.5 billion smartphones were sold in 2017.\nThe Commission said that a study of Google Search use on Android phones where it was pre-installed versus Windows phones where it had to be installed by the user showed that users do not download competing apps in numbers that can offset the significant commercial advantage derived through pre-installation.\nPichai also said the decision ignores the fact that Android phones compete with iOS phones. The Commission said Apple did not sufficiently constrain Google, and provided reasons for this, including that Apple devices are typically priced higher than Android devices and may therefore not be accessible to a large part of the Android device user base. About 80 percent of smartphones in Europe and worldwide run on Android, according to the Commission. \nThe EU began investigating Googles Android in 2015 after a complaint two years prior from FairSearch, CNBC reported. According to its website, FairSearch is a group of businesses and organizations united to promote economic growth, innovation and choice across the Internet ecosystem by fostering and defending competition in online and mobile search. At the time of FairSearchs complaint, it included Microsoft and Nokia, according to CNBC.\nLast year, the Commission fined Google $2.7 billion for abusing its dominance as a search engine by giving an illegal advantage to Google's own comparison shopping service. The Commission is also continuing to investigate a case against Googles search advertising service, AdSense. That case involves Google placing restrictions on the ability of certain third party websites to display search advertisements from Google's competitors, according to the Commission.\nGoogle is predicted to account for about a third of all worldwide mobile advertisements in 2018, according to research firm eMarketer. That would give the company an estimated $40 billion in sales outside the U.S. this year, Bloomberg reported.\nSources: Bloomberg, CNBC, CNN, European Commission, Google, Reuters, TechCrunch, The New York Times",

The program, known as Temporary Protected Status (TPS), was implemented for people from Nicaragua and Honduras in 1999 following Hurricane Mitch. \nThe Nicaraguans will now have an additional 12 months to leave the U.S. or seek another lawful immigration status. There are currently 5,000 Nicaraguans and 86,000 residents from Honduras living in the U.S. with TPS status. \nNicaraguan and Honduran TPS recipients have been required to renew their status every 18 months since 1999, and both programs were set to expire on January 5, 2018. DHS postponed a decision on whether to end the Honduran program in order to gather more information. This automatically renewed the Hondurans protection for six months, until July 2018. \nThe program was originally created to provide temporary protection to people from countries damaged by war or natural disaster. The program currently covers 435,000 people from nine different countries. Earlier this year, President Donald Trump ended the Temporary Protected Status for Sudan.\n\nSources: AP, BBC",

      "Content": "Nigerian Minister of Information Alhaji Lai Mohammed told reporters on Friday that local officials had mistakenly said that the army rescued 76 schoolgirls on Wednesday who are suspected to have been abducted by the Boko Haram militant group. The minister said the girls remain unaccounted for and apologized. Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari called the situation a national disaster on Friday. \nBoko Haram members had taken the girls from the Government Girls Science Technical School in the town of Dapchi, Yobe state, on Monday, after firing guns and setting off explosives. Witnesses told reporters the abducted girls had been taken away in trucks. There are inconsistent reports of the number of girls missing.\nThe president said in a statement on Friday, We are sorry that this could have happened. We pray that our gallant armed forces will locate and safely return your missing family members.\nThe state government had incorrectly said some of the girls had been rescued from the terrorists who abducted them, and were now with the Nigerian army. The Yobe police commissioner told reporters on Tuesday that Boko Haram had also abducted three people from the nearby town of Gaidam.\nDapchi is about 170 miles (275 km) northwest of Chibok, the town where Boko Haram kidnapped more than 270 girls in 2014. About 60 of those girls escaped the group shortly after, and others have since been released in exchange for money or for the release of imprisoned Boko Haram members. About 100 of the girls who were kidnapped then are believed to still be in captivity.\nBoko Harams insurgency campaign has displaced an estimated 2.4 million people in the region since 2013, according to the United Nations. Reuters reports that 20,000 people have been killed by the group. \n\nNote: We initially reported on the local officials statement that 76 girls had been rescued. This article has been updated to reflect the Minister of Informations statement to the contrary.\nSources: ABC News, BBC, BBC, Reuters, Vanguard",

Tudose said he was resigning \"with his head high,\" according to BBC.\nSocial Democratic Party (SDP) speaker Liviu Dragnea said 60 lawmakers voted against Tudose, four supported him and four others abstained. Development Minister Paul Stanescu will serve as interim prime minister, SDP officials said. \nAccording to The Washington Post, Romanias president must now propose a new candidate for prime minister, and the parliament will vote on the candidate. \nTudose, 50, assumed the role of prime minister in Romania in June 2017, when he replaced Sorin Grindeanu, who vacated the position after a vote of no-confidence from SDP.\nLast week, Tudose reportedly accused Interior Minister Carmen Dan of publicly lying to him about having found a replacement for the police department head, according to Romania Insider. Tudose reportedly called on Dan to resign, which she refused to do. Dan is reportedly a close ally of Dragnea, The Washington Post reported. \nBefore serving as SDPs parliament speaker, Dragnea served as a cabinet minister. He was convicted in 2015 on ballot-rigging charges in a 2012 referendum. \nOn Monday, Tudose said: \"I did not want to break the party.\" He added, \"They named me, they removed me.

      "Content": "A group representing doctors and medical students in Quebec posted online a petition on Sunday that called for doctors' raises to be canceled and the funds to be distributed for the good of health care workers. The group, Mdecins qubcois pour le rgime public (Quebec doctors for the public regime), also called for resources to be distributed to provide health services worthy of the people of Quebec. As of midnight Thursday, more than 780 doctors had signed the petition. \nThe petition said the region's nurses and other professionals face difficult working conditions\" due to cuts in recent years.\" CBC News reported that nurses have some mandatory overtime requirements and have had \"staffing issues\" that resulted in nurses caring for \"too many patients.\"\nQuebec's health minister, Gatan Barrette, said that the doctors could give up their raises if the majority of doctors voted for such an action. If they feel they are overpaid, they can leave the money on the table. I guarantee you I can make good use of it. Barrette added that the doctors who support the action are still a small minority.\nLast month, Quebec's federation of medical specialists negotiated with the province's health ministry for average annual raises of 1.4 percent through 2023 for about 10,000 specialists. This corresponded to an increase in total yearly salaries from $4.7 to $5.4 billion Canadian dollars ($3.6 to $4.2 billion). In October of last year, general practitioners in Quebec signed a deal with the government for average raises of 1.8 percent per year for eight years.\nThe average yearly salary of a specialist in Quebec in 2015 was about CA$403,537 ($312,000) and in Ontario about CA$367,154 ($285,000), according to the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI). The average salary for Canadian doctors in 2015 was about USD 257,000, according to the CIHI.\nCanada has a socialized system of medicine and doctors are paid through the government. \nSources: CBC News, CNN",

Changing district boundaries can affect election outcomes depending on how voters are grouped. Currently, Republicans hold 12 of 18 of the states seats.\nFollowing a challenge from Democrats, Pennsylvanias Supreme Court said in January that existing congressional districts clearly, plainly and palpably violat[ed] the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and that these violations provided Republicans with a political advantage. The court requested redistricting the congressional map.\nRepublicans appealed the lower courts decision to the U.S. Supreme Court, arguing that the federal constitution only granted legislatures, not state courts, the power to draw congressional districts, HuffPost reported. U.S. Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito denied the appeal without referring it to the whole court.\nAccording to the state ruling, Pennsylvanias General Assembly must now submit a redistricting plan. If the governor accepts the [...] plan, it shall be submitted to this court on or before February 15. If no plan is submitted, that court would adopt a plan based on the evidentiary record developed in the Commonwealth Court.\"\nPennsylvania House Speaker Michael Turzai (R) and Senate President Pro Tempore Joe Scarnati (R) issued a statement saying they do not believe the states congressional map is unconstitutional.\nIn a 2017 report, the Brennan Center for Justice said, Every decade, states redraw congressional maps after the decennial census. Redistricting allows districts to be rebalanced, ensuring in theory that all districts are both equally populated and representative. The 2010 census marked the last time Pennsylvania's congressional maps were redrawn. \nPrimary elections in Pennsylvania are scheduled for May 15.\nSources: CNN, HuffPost",

After Obama was elected, his administration terminated all George W. Bush appointees and made new appointments.\nPACHA was created in 1995 under the Clinton administration. PACHA provides advice, information, and recommendations to the [Health and Human Services] Secretary regarding programs, policies, and research to promote effective treatment, prevention and cure of HIV disease and AIDS.

      "Content": "The U.S. Supreme Court ruled 7-2 on Monday in favor of a Colorado baker who had declined to make a wedding cake for a same-sex couple in 2012. The courts majority opinion said the Colorado Civil Rights Commission, which first adjudicated the issue, had showed impermissible hostility toward the sincere religious beliefs of the baker Jack Phillips. The courts ruling specified that larger constitutional questions of businesses declining to provide service to same-sex people on religious basis in other circumstances must await further elaboration in the courts. \nJustice Anthony Kennedy wrote in the majority opinion that the states civil rights commissions hostility towards Phillips religious beliefs was inconsistent with the First Amendment's guarantee that our laws be applied in a manner that is neutral toward religion. One commissioner had said, for instance, that freedom of religion had been used to justify slavery and the Holocaust.\nJustices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor dissented, arguing that statements by Colorado commissioners who had ruled against Phillips did not change whether or not Phillips violated the states anti-discrimination laws. What matters is that Phillips would not provide a good or service to a same-sex couple that he would provide to a heterosexual couple, Ginsberg wrote in the dissenting opinion.\nBackground of the case\nColorado-based couple Charlie Craig and David Mullins got married in 2012 in Massachusetts, where same-sex marriage was legal at the time and while it was illegal in Colorado. The couple planned to hold a reception in Denver, and went to Phillips Masterpiece bakery to order a cake. \nIn July 2012, the couple and Craigs mother met with Phillips, and when Phillips learned the cake would be for a same-sex wedding reception he declined to make the cake. Phillips said he remembered telling the couple, Sorry guys, I dont make cakes for same-sex weddings. He offered to sell other baked goods, such as birthday cakes. The couple left the establishment.\nCraig and Mullins filed a complaint with the Colorado Civil Rights Commission after it learned the states public accommodations law prohibited discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. The Colorado Anti-discrimination Act (CADA) requires that businesses that are open to the public serve customers equally regardless of disability, race, creed, color, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, national origin, or ancestry.\nPhillips argued that requiring him to use his artistic talents to create a cake would violate his First Amendment rights to free speech and freedom of religion. \nThe commission ruled in the couples favor, then Phillips took the case to the Colorado Court of Appeals. The appeals court upheld the commission's ruling, concluding that the Colorado law did not require Philips to support or endorse any particular religious view, rather it prohibited him from discriminating against a potential customer on the basis of sexual orientation. Phillips appealed the case to the Supreme Court. \nThe Justice Department under the Trump administration agreed with Phillips reasoning. In October of last year, Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued a memorandum outlining that the government may not discriminate against religious people or entities. \nThe Supreme Court ruling\nThe Supreme Court ruled that the Colorado Civil Rights Commission violated Phillips rights by demonstrating hostility towards his religious beliefs. \nThe Courts precedents make clear that the baker, in his capacity as the owner of a business serving the public, might have his right to the free exercise of religion limited by generally applicable laws, Kennedy wrote. Still, the delicate question of when the free exercise of his religion must yield to an otherwise valid exercise of state power needed to be determined in an adjudication in which religious hostility on the part of the State itself would not be a factor in the balance the State sought to reach.\nThe outcome of cases like this in other circumstances must await further elaboration in the courts, all in the context of recognizing that these disputes must be resolved with tolerance, without undue disrespect to sincere religious beliefs, and without subjecting gay persons to indignities when they seek goods and services in an open market, Kennedy wrote.\nJustice Clarence Thomas voted in favor of Phillips, but did not support the majoritys rationale for the ruling; so the ruling was 7-2, while the majority opinion was 6-2. Kennedy also wrote the majority opinion in the 2015 Supreme Court ruling that legalized same-sex marriage throughout the U.S.\nViewpoints on the ruling \nPhillips, who founded the bakery in 1993, previously said in an interview, I didn't want to use my artistic talents to create something that went against my Christian faith, and said he has declined to make Halloween cakes for the same reason, calling it a pagan holiday. He has also said his decision was not about turning away these customers, it's about doing a cake for an event  a religious sacred event  that conflicts with my conscience.\nPhillips declined to comment after the ruling. His representation from the Alliance Defending Freedom, attorney Michael Farris, said his client was ecstatic over the ruling. \nTolerance and respect for good-faith differences of opinion are essential in a society like ours, said Kristen Waggoner, another of Phillips attorney at the alliance. This decision makes clear that the government must respect [Phillips] beliefs about marriage.\nMullins has said the case is about the rights of gay people to receive equal service in business, and is about basic access to public life. \nThe decision means our fight against discrimination and unfair treatment will continue, Mullins said in a statement after Mondays ruling. We have always believed that in America, you should not be turned away from a business open to the public because of who you are.\nAmerican Civil Liberties Union representative Louise Melling said, the court reversed the Masterpiece Cakeshop decision based on concerns unique to the case but reaffirmed its longstanding rule that states can prevent the harms of discrimination in the marketplace, including against LGBT people.\nTwenty-one states have anti-discrimination laws the expressly prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.\nSources: CNN, DOJ Memo, Fox News, Pink News, Reuters, Supreme Court Ruling, The New York Times, The Washington Post, USA Today",

She was released from custody within hours of the not guilty verdict, after spending 14 months in jail. \nSalman is the widow of Omar Mateen, who shot and killed 49 people and injured 53 at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, in June 2016. Mateen, an American-born son of Afghan immigrants, had pledged allegiance to the Islamic State (IS) before killing people at the club. He died at the scene. \nThe FBI arrested Salman in January of last year on a charge of obstruction of justice and aiding and abetting by providing material support to a foreign terrorist organization, according to Orlando Police Chief John Mina. Salman, a 31-year-old who was born in California to Palestinian parents, denied the charges, saying she was not aware of her husbands plan. A judge rejected motions to either dismiss the case or order a mistrial earlier this week. \nProsecutors had argued that Salman had helped her late husband look for locations for an attack and gave him the green light to commit terrorism. The jury had been provided with a signed confession that said she helped her husband. The FBI had not video or tape recorded Salmans confession.\nThe defense argued that Salman had a low IQ and signed a false confession to the police after a long interrogation and out of fear of being separated from her son, who is now five. Authorities had questioned her for 11 hours. The defense also argued that Mateen had concealed aspects of his life from Salman, so she would not have known what he would do.\nThe FBI also found receipts and cell phone signal locations that showed Salman was away from Pulse nightclub on the day she had admitted to being there with her husband to evaluate it as a target. Prosecutors did not provide evidence, such as online content, that would have showed she supported IS. \nThe jury deliberated for a total of 12 hours before coming to the not guilty verdict. The charges against Salman could have led to a life sentence for a guilty verdict. \nSources: AP, Fox News",

Russian news outlet RT reported that the Russian Defense Ministry said the Su-25 jets were escorting a humanitarian aid convoy near Mayadin, Syria, and were intercepted by one F-22 while in Russian-controlled airspace on the Russian side of the Euphrates River.\nThe Euphrates River marks a de-confliction line; the U.S. and Russia have agreed to contact each other if they are planning to cross to the other side of the line. U.S. aircraft are to remain on the east side and Russian on the west side of the river unless advance notice is given.\nThe U.S. military said two F-22As fired flares in front of the Russian Su-25 jets that had crossed to the east side of the Euphrates. One of the Su-25 aircraft flew near an F-22A and the F-22A performed evasive maneuvers. A Russian Su-35 jet also crossed the line, according to Air Forces Central Command spokesman Lt. Col. Damien Pickart, and was intercepted by an F-22A. Pickart said the Russian aircraft returned to airspace on the west side of the river after approximately 40 minutes and multiple calls on the emergency de-confliction channel between U.S. and Russian forces in Syria.\nThe Russian Defense Ministry said an F-22 crossed over to the west side of the Euphrates to engage with the Russian Su-25 jets. The ministry said an Su-35 flew towards the F-22 and then the U.S. jet flew away.\nAccording to RT, the U.S. and Russia established the de-confliction channel in 2015 as part of a flight safety memorandum in Syria. Pickart said Russian jets fly into U.S. airspace in the de-confliction area 6 to 8 times per day. CNN did not report on how many of those times were after pre-notification using the de-confliction channel. \nIn November, Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump met in Vietnam and issued a joint statement agreeing to maintain open military channels of communication in the fight against Islamic State in Syria.\nSources: CNN, RT",

      "Content": "Last Friday, a 12-person jury in Battleford, Saskatchewan, found Gerald Stanleynot guilty of second-degree murder in the death of Colten Boushie, who was a member of the Red Pheasant Cree First Nation. After the verdict, there were rallies and protests for legal reform, with advocates claiming that the court system, and the reported all-white jury, did not provide justice for Boushie.Much of the coverage of these recent developments alluded to the history and complexities between First Nations and the Canadian government. However, they provided little or no specifics to better understand these current issues. Here is a brief explainer on the subject.\nWho are the First Nations?\nFirst Nations peoples are the descendants of Canadas original inhabitants. They are also referred to as Indigenous or Aboriginal people. According to the government,901,053 people have registered as First Nations. Canada has 617 First Nations communities. About 52 percent of those who are registered live on reserves.\nWhats the history of Canadas relations with First Nations?\nPrior to the 1800s, the First Nations role in government under British rule was primarily militaristic and commercial. For example, during the U.S. Revolutionary War, First Nations fought alongside the British (they did so again during the War of 1812). After the war, some First Nations lost land to the U.S. under the Treaty of Versailles; others lost land to new British settlers. As more settlers arrived and Canadas population grew, more First Nation land was surrendered through various land treaties.\nAssimilation\nAround 1820, the government attempted to assimilate First Nation peoples into British civilization. They were encouraged to convert to Christianity. In 1876, the Canadian government enacted the Indian Act, which gave the Department of Indian Affairs the ability to determine who could be considered Indian. It allowed the government to manage First Nation lands, resources and currency. The Act also allowed the government to control access to intoxicants such as alcohol, and continue to promote Canadas version of civilization. \nAlthough the Act was amended multiple times, at one point it banned certain religious ceremonies, and in 1927 it was amended to prevent fundraising by First Nations to pursue land claims without government permission. That amendment, as well as restrictions on certain religious ceremonies, was repealed in 1951.\nPart of the assimilation process involved educating First Nations children in government-funded residential schools, which most children attended and resided in for 10 months out of the year. The schools, which existed since 1857, forced the children to forgo their traditional languages, dress, religion and culture. The last of the residential schools closed in 1996. \nPhysical and sexual abuse reportedly took place at some of these schools; some of the claims led to convictions. The abuse claims eventually resulted in internal and government inquiries, and in 2007, the government established a $1.9 billion compensation package for those who were forced to attend the schools. In 2008, the government issued a formal apology to all former students of residential schools. According to CBC, $1.6 billion had been paid out to former students as of 2013. \nRepresentation\nIn 1960, First Nations were given the right to vote in federal elections. In the early 1970s, First Nations began to form representative organizations to promote their interests nationally. Such organizations also made claims to land. For example, in 1971, when a hydroelectric project was proposed in Quebec, Cree and Inuit successfully argued that they had aboriginal rights to the land.\nFirst Nations also advocated changes to the Indian Act. For example, the Act had stipulated that First Nations women lost their Indian status if they married non-Aboriginal men. After groups lobbied to change the law, parliament passed Bill C-31 in 1985, which removed such provisions from the Act.\nAfter a 1990 land claim conflict between Mohawks and land developers resulted in the death of one police officer and led to the involvement of Canadian Armed Forces, the government established the Indian Specific Claims Commission and the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples (RCAP). The commission was created to arbitrate issues between the government, Canadian society and First Nation peoples.\nIn 1995, the government began negotiating with Indigenous groups to establish systems of self-government. At least 17 self-government agreements between the groups and the federal government have been completed.\nIn 1996, after about 14 years of lobbying for a holiday to recognize First Nations people, the government designated June 21 as National Aboriginal Day.\nFirst Nations and crime\nIn a 2006 report, Canadas Justice Department cited 2004 data indicating that 40 percent of indigenous Canadians reported having been victims of crime the year leading up to the survey, compared to 28 percent of non-indigenous Canadians. The same report noted that indigenous people were three times more likely to have been victims of violent crime compared to the general population (319 incidents versus 101 incidents per 1,000 people). The report goes on to say:\n\nThese statistics confirm that Aboriginal people are disproportionately represented as victims of crime in Canada. Perpetrators of violence against Aboriginal people are most often other members of the Aboriginal community such as spouses, relatives, or friends of the victim, and as such, victimization among Aboriginal people in Canada is often regarded as a mirror image of Aboriginal offending.\n\nA2016 report by Canadas Office of the Correctional Investigator found that indigenous people constitute less than five percent of Canadas overall population, and 26.4 percent of its federal prison inmate population. The report noted that for the last three decades, there has been an increase every year in the federal incarceration rate of First Nations peoples. It also said parole grant rates were much lower for Indigenous than non-Indigenous offenders, and that Indigenous inmates are more likely to experience segregation and stay imprisoned longer than any other group. For example, if an offender was sentenced to three to six years, he or she may be more likely to serve the full six years.",

      "Content": "The National Enquirer, a tabloid owned by American Media Inc. (AMI), reportedly kept a safe containing records of payments used to silence people who had sold AMI stories on President Donald Trump, The Associated Press first reported Friday. \nThe tabloid allegedly bought the rights to stories about Trump and other celebrities with the intention of not publishing them to prevent the stories from being made public. The practice is colloquially known as catch-and-kill.\nNews of the safe was published after The Wall Street Journal and Vanity Fair reported that David Pecker, the chairman of AMI, was granted immunity in exchange for giving prosecutors information about how former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen and Trump allegedly paid the tabloid to suppress stories. \nProsecutors said the Enquirer had given the Trump campaign prior notice of potentially damaging stories. In one instance, AMIs Chief Content Officer Dylan Howard arranged a $150,000 payment to Karen McDougal for the rights to her story about allegedly having an affair with Trump in 2006 and 2007. Variety reported that the payment was intended to prevent the story from getting published anywhere.\nCourt papers in the Cohen case obtained by AP said Pecker offered to help deal with negative stories about [Trumps] relationships with women by, among other things, assisting the campaign in identifying such stories so they could be purchased and their publication avoided.\nAccording to AP, Pecker and Howard removed the payment records and other documents from the AMI safe in the weeks prior to Trumps presidential inauguration. People familiar with the documents removal did not know whether they were destroyed or moved to a different location.\nCohen pleaded guilty on Tuesday to eight charges, including tax evasion and campaign finance violations originating from the alleged payments he made to two women with which Trump allegedly had extramarital sex. \nThe Department of Justice said the payments to the two women violated campaign finance laws, which limit the amount that an individual can donate to a campaign to $2,700. Under the law, a donation can be considered expenditures coordinated with a candidate or his political committee. Presidential candidates and their committees are also prohibited from accepting contributions from individuals that exceed $2,700.\nCohen, who was allegedly involved in the payment made to McDougal, also reportedly paid $130,000 to former adult film actress Stephanie Clifford, who claimed she had an affair with Trump a decade before he was elected president. Cohen told the judge he made the payments at Trumps request. Trump has denied having the affairs. \nCohen and Pecker are reportedly cooperating with federal prosecutors investigating the payments. \nWhile Trump initially said he did not know about the payment to Clifford, he has since claimed to have found out about it later on. Trump also said the payments were not taken from his campaign finances.\n\nSources: AP, DOJ Cohen announcement, Trump interview, Variety",

      "Content": "President Donald Trump signed an executive order effective 12:15 p.m. Monday, prohibiting anyone in the U.S. from making transactions with any digital currency issued by the government of Venezuela. On Feb. 20, Venezuelan President Nicols Maduro announced the petro, a digital currency backed by the countrys crude oil reserves. He said the currency had raised $735 million through a private auction. That figure has not been independently verified, according to CNN. Maduro also announced plans to issue another digital currency, petro gold, that would be backed by precious metals.\nThe U.S. sanctioned Venezuela last year, preventing U.S. citizens or banks from purchasing bonds from the government or its state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA). The U.S. also implemented sanctions against some Venezuelan officials, including Maduro, in November of last year, preventing U.S. citizens from doing business with them and freezing their assets in the U.S. \nThe sanctions were a response to allegations from the U.S. Treasury Departments Office of Foreign Assets Control that Venezuelan officials tampered with the countrys Oct. 15 state elections in favor of Maduros United Socialist Party of Venezuela.\nVenezuelas central bank filings reportedly show the country has $9.4 billion in reserves, mostly held in gold bars, according to CNN. The value of the countrys gold reserves fell 14 percent in 2017 compared to the previous year.\nLast year, inflation in Venezuela was more than 4,000 percent, and its traditional currency, the bolivar, lost 98 percent of its value, CNN reported. In November of last year, the country defaulted on a $200 million payment on foreign loans; Standard  Poors downgraded its credit rating as a result. \nMaduro is running for reelection in Venezuelas elections in May. \nSources: White House statement, CNN, CNN,Reuters, Reuters",

      "Content": "On Tuesday, Space Exploration Technologies Corp. (SpaceX) launched its Falcon Heavy rocket into space from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. According to the company, the rocket has the ability to launch 140,660 pounds (63,800 kg), the equivalent of a loaded Boeing 737 airplane, into \"low Earth orbit. SpaceX said the rocket is designed to be reusable, making launches about a third of the cost of the next largest payload-carrying rocket, the Delta IV Heavy.\nThe Falcon Heavy is equipped with three of SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket boosters, with nine engines in each booster. Upon takeoff, two-side booster rockets detached from the rocket and landed on launchpads. The rockets had been reused from previous Falcon 9 flights with planned landings. The center booster rocket did not land on a floating platform in the ocean as planned. According to SpaceX, a malfunction led to only one of the center boosters engines firing during its descent; at least three were required for a successful landing. \nThe Falcon Heavy launched carrying a Tesla car belonging to SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, with a spacesuit-fitted mannequin in the driver's seat. The car was launched into an orbit around the sun that would take it further away from Earth than Mars. Musk has said he wants to launch a mission to Mars in the next decade.\nThe company also said it plans to use the Falcon Heavy this year to launch its Dragon spacecraft around the moon with two paying customers on board. Musk said the rockets next flight would be in three to six months. SpaceX has planned flights for the the U.S. Air Force and Arabsat, a Saudi Arabian communications company.\nSpaceX said the Falcon Heavy cost about $500 million to develop, and it has priced flights at $90 million.\nThe company added that the only rocket to have had a higher payload capacity was the Saturn V moon rocket, last launched in 1973. The payload capacity of the Falcon Heavy is more than two and a half times that of either the now-retired space shuttle from NASA or the Delta IV Heavy rocket, according to SpaceX. The Delta IV Heavy has been flown by United Launch Alliance since 2002. The Alliance is a joint venture of Lockheed Martin Space Systems and Boeing Defense, Space  Security. According to the Alliance, the Delta IV Heavy has flown 35 missions with a 100 percent mission success rate through the end of 2017.\nSources: BBC, The New York Times, The Verge",

The tweet did not mention any specific people or allegations.\nTrumps full tweet said, Peoples (sic) lives are being shattered and destroyed by a mere allegation. Some are true and some are false. Some are old and some are new. There is no recovery for someone falsely accused - life and career are gone. Is there no such thing any longer as Due Process?\nThis week, two White House aides resigned after allegations of domestic abuse from their ex-wives were made public. While reporting on the tweet, some media outlets related Trumps tweet to the #MeToo movement and the concern expressed by some that accused men have been judged in the media and punished without due process. Some outlets also mentioned previous allegations of sexual misconduct against the president himself.\nAbout the resignations\nWhite House Staff Secretary Rob Porter resigned on Wednesday. The Washington Post published a restraining order that Porters ex-wife Jennifer Willoughby had obtained against him in 2010. A reporter from The Intercept also published photographs showing Porters other ex-wife Colbie Holderness with a black eye, which she said was the result of Porter hitting her while they were on vacation in 2003. Porter denied the allegations. \nWhite House speech writer David Sorensen resigned Friday after his ex-wife Jessica Corbett alleged that he had run over her foot with a car and extinguished a cigarette on her hand while they were married. Their two-and-a-half year marriage began in 2014. Sorensen has also denied the allegations.\nIn both cases, the information came to the attention of the FBI while agents were conducting background checks on Porter and Sorensen to issue security clearances for them. The FBI passed on the information to the White House.\nOn Thursday, Chief of Staff John Kelly sent an email to White House staff saying, I want you to know that we all take matters of domestic violence very seriously. Domestic violence is abhorrent and has no place in our society.\nSources: Fox News, The New York Times, The Washington Post, Vox",

The merger was part of a restructuring that would, along with other measures, save $1.7 billion per year by 2022. Xerox also announced that Chief Executive Officer Jeff Jacobson had resigned, and that John Visentin would assume the role. Xerox also replaced five directors as part of changes to its board.\nThe two companies had publicized earlier this year that Fuji Xerox, their 56-year-old joint venture, would combine with Xerox. Fuji Xerox would then take a 50.1 percent stake in the newfound company, New Fuji Xerox.\nXerox said earlier this month it was seeking better terms for a proposed merger with Fujifilm. Icahn and Deason, who own 15 percent of Xerox, said the merger plan undervalued Xerox, according to Reuters.\nXerox said it was ending the deal with Fuji Xerox partly because Fujifilm did not present audited financial information for Fuji Xerox by a mid-April deadline. Xerox also stated that there were material deviations between audited financial statements from Fuji Xerox and unaudited statements from prior submissions.\nXeroxs new board members are Jonathan Christodoro, Keith Cozza, Nicholas Graziano, Scott Letier and John Visentin. The outgoing directors are William Curt Hunter, Robert J. Keegan, Charles Prince, Ann N. Reese and Stephen H. Rusckowski. Xerox said in a statement that its new board would meet in short order and begin a process to evaluate all strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value.\nRegarding the settlement with Xerox, Icahn said, We are extremely pleased that Xerox finally terminated its decision to cede control of the company to Fujifilm. He added, We have often said that the most important person at a company (by far) is the CEO. We are therefore also pleased that John Visentin, a tried and true veteran in this area, will be taking the helm.\nSources: Reuters, The Washington Post",

Eastern Ghouta, a suburb of Damascus, is controlled by government opposition forces and has been under siege since 2013. About 400,000 people reportedly live there.\nThe Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) said more than 210 people had been killed, including 54 children, and more than 850 had been wounded in the air raids and mortar attacks on Ghouta.\nA doctor from Damascus told Al Jazeera that residential areas, schools and markets had been bombed. The Syrian government said it only targeted militants. Union of Medical Care and Relief Organizations (UOSSM) said bombs hit five hospitals in Ghouta on Monday. According to its website, UOSSM provides free medical aid to Syrians. \nLast year, eastern Ghouta was declared a \"de-escalation\" zone by Syria, Russia, Iran and Turkey.\nThe Syrian civil war began in 2011. Since then, more than 250,000 people have been killed and more than 11 million have left the country as refugees, according to BBC.\nSources: Al Jazeera, Reuters",

On March 1, President Donald Trump announced import tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum. On March 23, the U.S. temporarily exempted Canada, Mexico, the EU, Australia, Argentina and Brazil from the tariffs until April 30. \nThe U.S. said it has reached agreements in principle on exemptions with Australia, Argentina and Brazil. \nIn a statement, the White House said, In all of these negotiations, the administration is focused on quotas that will restrain imports, prevent transshipment, and protect the national security.\nThe World Trade Organization (WTO) recognizes an exemption in the 1947 General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, allowing countries to impose some tariffs under some conditions when national security may be affected.\nThe EU said in a statement the U.S. decision to delay prolongs market uncertainty, which is already affecting business decisions. It added that the EU should be fully and permanently exempted from these measures, as they cannot be justified on the grounds of national security.\nCommerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said the U.S. was considering imposing import quotas that limit the maximum amount of imports from a particular country, in exchange for exempting some countries from the tariffs. \nThe U.S. had already announced an agreement with South Korea to exempt it from steel tariffs in exchange for the country reducing its steel exports to the U.S. by about 30 percent.\nThe top five countries or blocs of countries from which the U.S. imported steel in January 2018 were Canada, the EU, South Korea, Mexico and Brazil, according to BBC.\nSources: BBC, European Commission, The Hill, The White House 1, The White House 2, The White House 3, WTO Rules",

No other eruptions have been reported, according to HVO.\nThere have been at least 600 smaller earthquakes in the area since Monday generated from the flow of underground magma, according to geologist Janet Babb with the HVO. While the lava flow has stopped at the Leilani Estates fissure, the eruption event may not be over and it is not possible to forecast how long it might last, according to Babb.\nAlso on Thursday, Hawaii Gov.

      "Content": "The sonic attack allegedly carried out against U.S. diplomats in Cuba and China may be linked to microwave radiation, according to a New York Times report. Douglas Smith, the lead author of a scientific study on the alleged attacks, said in an interview with the Times that microwaves were now considered a main suspect. \nMicrowaves are a type of electromagnetic radiation transmitted in waves or particles at different wavelengths and frequencies. Microwaves can be used to cook food (in microwave ovens), and to transmit mobile phone calls and radio signals. \nThe first reported attacks on U.S. diplomats occurred in Cuba in November 2016 after the U.S. presidential election. American diplomats and their families claimed they heard high-pitched sounds in their residences, and reported symptoms such as nausea, headaches, fatigue, dizziness, sleep problems and hearing loss. In May 2018, a U.S. consulate staffer in China reported similar symptoms.\nA group of scientists and doctors from the University of Pennsylvania, including Smith, later reviewed the symptoms of 21 diplomats who served in Cuba. The group issued its findings in March 2018, saying the apparent injuries the diplomats sustained had an unclear origin. The study did not detail the number or suspected frequency of attacks that may have occurred.\nWhile the study did not mention the possibility of a microwave weapon, Smith told the Times that he and his colleagues now suspect microwave radiation to be responsible for the injuries.\nEverybody was relatively skeptical at first, Smith said of the microwave theory. And everyone now agrees there's something there. According to U.S.-based scientist Allan Frey, microwaves can trick the brain into perceiving sounds that arent heard by the ear and induce sonic delusions. \nThe Times reported that both U.S. and Russian governments have studied the concept of microwave weapons. In 2014, the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) confirmed that an undisclosed hostile country may have a high-powered microwave system weapon with the ability to weaken, intimidate, or kill an enemy over time and without leaving evidence.\nWhen the Times asked the U.S. State Department about the microwave theory, it said the investigation had not yet identified the cause or source of the alleged attacks.\n",

The FBI arrested Salman in January of last year on a charge of obstruction of justice and aiding and abetting by providing material support to a foreign terrorist organization, according to Orlando Police Chief John Mina. Salman, 31, has denied the charges, saying she was not aware of her husbands plan, and pleaded not guilty. \nA week into Salmans trial, prosecutors informed her lawyers that the shooter Omar Mateens father, Seddique Mateen, had been a confidential informant for the FBI at various points in time between January 2005 and June 2016, according to court documents. Assistant U.S. Attorney Sara Sweeney informed Salmans lawyers of this via email on Saturday. \nSalmans lawyers argued that prosecutors delayed disclosure of Seddique Mateens role with the FBI had violated her Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights to due process and a fair trial, respectively. They alleged Seddique Mateens role as a source for the FBI was why it did not investigate the possibility that he was involved in his sons crime. \nU.S. District Judge Paul Byron ruled on Monday that the fathers status as an informant was not relevant to Salmans case and not grounds for a mistrial. This trial is not about Seddique Mateen. Its about Noor Salman, the judge concluded. \nSources: AP, AP, CNN, Court Motion",

Bill C-45, known as the Cannabis Act, was passed by the House of Commons, Canadas lower parliamentary house, last November. Sale of marijuana to people under 18 years of age will be illegal under the act. A legal cannabis market could be set up within eight to 12 weeks, according to CBC News.\nThis legislation will help protect our youth from the risks of cannabis while keeping profits out of the hands of criminals and organized crime, Canadian Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould said.\nThe bill, which was first introduced to parliament in April of last year, legalizes the carrying and sharing of up to 1.06 ounces (30 grams) of legally-obtained marijuana by adults in public. Adults will also be allowed to grow up to four cannabis plants in their homes. \nCanada has also modified its impaired driving laws to further regulate and enforce the law against driving under the influence of cannabis, including setting legal limits for amounts of THC in the blood. THC is a psychoactive compound present in cannabis.\nProvinces will be responsible for deciding where marijuana is to be sold, CNN reported. In Newfoundland and Labrador, marijuana will be sold in Loblaws grocery stores, and in Ontario it will only be sold in 40 state-run stores. Provinces can also increase the minimum age for purchase of marijuana through provincial legislation.\nOn Tuesday evening, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau tweeted, Its been too easy for our kids to get marijuana - and for criminals to reap the profits. Today, we change that. Our plan to legalize  regulate marijuana just passed the Senate. #PromiseKept\nConservative Sen. Leo Housakos, former Speaker of the Senate, said, We have a bill that has an overarching goal to reduce the marijuana use among young people in this country and what it does right off the get go is normalizes it.\nThere's nothing in this bill that indicates to me that we're tackling the problem, which is increased marijuana use among young people, Housakos said.\nOnce the passage of the bill is formalized, Canada will become the second country in the world to legalize marijuana nationwide. In 2013, Uruguay legalized production, sale and consumption of marijuana. In the U.S., nine states and the District of Columbia allow recreational marijuana use, and 30 states allow medical marijuana use, CNN reported.\nThe Canadian illegal cannabis industry is currently worth an estimated $5.3 billion ($7 billion Canadian) annually, according to Canadian Sen. Tony Dean.\nSources: CBC News, CNN",

      "Content": "On Saturday, the FBI released partially-redacted Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrant applications for the surveillance of former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page. The applications said the FBI believes Page has been the subject of targeted recruitment by the Russian government as part of its alleged 2016 election interference efforts. The applications were also the subject of the February Republican Nunes memo and a Democratic response memo. Page has denied being an agent for Russia and has not been charged with a crime related to the investigation.\nThe 412-page document contains the original 66-page October 2016 warrant application, and three subsequent renewal applications, each progressively longer in page count. The New York Times, Judicial Watch and others requested the Justice Department (DOJ) release the documents under the Freedom of Information Act. According to its website, Judicial Watch, Inc. is a conservative, non-partisan educational foundation, [which] promotes transparency, accountability and integrity in government, politics and the law. \nThe FISA applications said Page has established relationships with Russian government officials, including Russian intelligence officers and that the FBI believed the Russian governments efforts are being coordinated with Page and perhaps other individuals associated with Trumps campaign. It also alleged that Page has been collaborating and conspiring with the Russian government. The application said, \"there is probable cause that such activities involve or are about to involve violations of the criminal statutes of the United States.\" In a partially redacted section, the document also mentioned undermin[ing] and influenc[ing] the outcome of the 2016 U.S. presidential election in violation of U.S. criminal law.\nOn Sunday, Page said the allegations against him in the FISA warrant application were so ridiculous. He said, You talk about misleading the courts, its just so misleading. Its literally a complete joke, he added.\nThe application referred to Page as a former foreign policy adviser of then-candidate Trump. On Sunday, Page said the term adviser was way over the top. I sat in on some meetings, he said.\nOn Sunday morning, Trump tweeted, Congratulations to @JudicialWatch and @TomFitton on being successful in getting the Carter Page FISA documents. As usual they are ridiculously heavily redacted but confirm with little doubt that the Department of Justice and FBI misled the courts. Witch Hunt Rigged, a Scam!\nThe Republican and Democratic memos\nTrump allowed the FISA warrant applications existence to be declassified in February, prior to the release of the Nunes memo, a document written by House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) and his staff.\nThe Nunes memo said the applications showed a troubling breakdown of the FISA process. According to the memo, the original October 2016 application cited an unverified dossier on Trump that was compiled by former British intelligence agent Christopher Steele with the help of Democratic National Committee (DNC) funding. Then-FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe testified that the FBI would not have sought the warrant without the dossier, according to the memo.\nDemocrats on the committee later released their own memo, saying the DOJ had an independent basis for investigating Page, including work he did with Russian state-owned companies while living in Moscow for three years, and that Russian spies allegedly tried to recruit Page. The memo said only a specific sub-section of the FISA warrant mentions the Steele report, regarding Pages alleged visit to Russia in March 2016 while a Trump campaign adviser. \nThe Nunes memo alleged the FBI did not disclose in the FISA warrant or renewal applications that Steeles report was financed by the DNC. The Democratic memo said the FBI disclosed to the FISA judges the assessed political motivation of those who hired Steele.\nNo other FISA applications for warrants have been made public since the FISA act passed in 1978, according to the Times.\nSources: CNN 1, CNN 2, The New York Times\n",

Drug overdose deaths increased by 21 percent to 63,632. Opioid-specific overdose deaths rose 28 percent, with more than 42,000 deaths in 2016. From 1999 to 2016, the death rate from drug overdoses increased from 6.1 to 19.8 people per 100,000.\nFor people in the U.S. who survive until age 65, the average life expectancy is 83 for men and 85.6 for women.\nIf you look at the other developed countries in the world, theyre not seeing this kind of thing. Life expectancy is going up, said Bob Anderson, chief of the Mortality Statistics Branch at the National Center for Health Statistics. He said that for the U.S., the key factor is the increase in drug overdose deaths.\nThe World Health Organization reported average global human life expectancy at 71.4 years in 2015 and at more than 80 years in 29 high-income countries.\nSources: The Washington Post, USA Today, CDC",

Kim flew to the Chinese city of Dalian and stayed for two days before returning to Pyongyang.\nKim and Xi discussed relations between their two countries as well as major issues of common concern, and Kim restated Pyongyangs willingness to forgo its nuclear arsenal. It was the second meeting between the two leaders in the last two months. They met for the first time in late March, during Kims first known trip abroad since becoming leader of North Korea in 2011.\nIt has been the DPRKs (Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea) consistent and clear stand to achieve denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, Kim said, according to Chinas state news agency Xinhua. Kim also said, As long as relevant parties abolish their hostile policies and remove security threats against the DPRK, there is no need for the DPRK to be a nuclear state and denuclearization can be realized.\nXi said, China is willing to continue to work with all relevant parties and play an active role in comprehensively advancing the process of peaceful resolution of the peninsula issue through dialogue, and realizing long-term peace and stability in the region.\nKim told Xi the denuclearization of the peninsula was North Koreas constant and clear position, and was quoted as saying, I hope to build mutual trust with the U.S. through dialogue.\nThe meeting took place before a summit between Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump, who has said the date and location of the summit is fixed but has yet to make details public.\nAccording to the White House, Trump and Xi held a phone call on Tuesday morning in which they discussed developments on the Korean peninsula and Kims visit to China. Trump and Xi agreed that sanctions on Pyongyang should be maintained until North Korea permanently dismantles its nuclear and missile programs, the White House said.\nSources: The Guardian, Reuters",

The announcement followed a ruling from a Federal District Court in Washington that barred the Trump administration's ban on transgender service personnel. In this ruling, also from Monday, Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly wrote, the Court is not persuaded that Defendants will be irreparably injured by allowing the accession of transgender individuals into the military. Judge Kollar-Kotelly also said that the ban most likely violates transgender peoples constitutional rights to due process and equal protection, according to The New York Times.\nIn June 2016, then-Defense Secretary Ash Carter announced an end to rules banning people with psychosexual conditions, including transgender people, from serving in the U.S. military. The new rules were to take effect within a year. In July this year, Trump announced on Twitter his decision not to implement the new rules and to continue the ban. \nOn July 27, Trump tweeted that the military cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption of allowing transgender individuals to serve. On Monday, the Times reported a 2016 study by the RAND Corporation estimatingthat allowing transgender people to serve would increase the militarys health costs from $2.4 to $8.4 million annually. The increase would represent 0.04 to 0.13 percent of its annual budget.\nWhite House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a press briefing Monday, The Department of Justice is currently reviewing the legal options to ensure the presidents directive is implemented. \nSources: CNN, The New York Times",

      "Content": "U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley announced Tuesday that the U.S. would withdraw from the U.N. Human Rights Council. Haley said the council showed bias against Israel and granted membership to other countries that she alleged had committed human rights violations. Haley issued her statement at the State Department, alongside Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\nI want to make it crystal clear that this step is not a retreat from our human rights commitments, Haley said. On the contrary. We take this step because our commitment does not allow us to remain a part of a hypocritical and self-serving organization that makes a mockery of human rights.\nHaley said the council showed disproportionate focus and unending hostility toward Israel, while it does not address the massive abuses in Venezuela and Iran, and it welcomes the Democratic Republic of Congo as a new member. With such behavior, the council ceases to be worthy of its name, Haley added. Such a council, in fact, damages the cause of human rights.\nThe council currently discusses Israels record on human rights at every meeting, according to The Washington Post, and before the U.S. joined in 2009, half the councils country-specific votes condemned Israel. Council resolutions about Israel reportedly declined to one-fifth of the votes in the first six years that the U.S. was involved, according to the Post. The council has issued more than 70 condemnations of Israel since it was founded in 2006, more than all other countries combined. \nHaley said attempts to reform the council were opposed by member states such as Russia, China, Cuba and Egypt. She did not elaborate on the reform attempts.\nLast year, Haley said the U.S. would leave the council if it did not revoke the memberships of states considered in violation of human rights, and if it did not take Israel off its standard meeting agenda.\nThe council was created in 2006 to replace the U.N.'s Human Rights Commission. According to BBC, the previous commission had received criticism for allowing membership to countries with questionable track records on human rights. \nPrior to Haleys announcement, the council was made up of 47 U.N. member states that are elected by the U.N. General Assembly. The U.S. joined the Council, which is based in Geneva, in 2009 under President Barack Obamas administration. This would be the first time a member state has voluntarily left the council, the Post reported.\nSources: BBC, CNN, The Washington Post",

The deaths include at least eight journalists from various media outlets, according to Najib Sharifi, director of the Afghan Journalists Safety Committee, revising an earlier report of nine journalist casualties. An Islamic State (IS) affiliate claimed responsibility for the attack.\nKabul police spokesman Hashmat Stanekzai said four of those killed were police officers. Wahid Majroh, a spokesman for the Ministry of Public Health, said the 45 injured were taken to city hospitals.\nThe bombs exploded in the central Shash Darak area of the Afghanistan capital, near the local NATO headquarters, U.S. embassy, Afghan presidential palace, Defense Ministry and other government buildings. After the first explosion, which detonated around 8 a.m. local time, journalists arrived on the scene to report on the attack. A second bomber reportedly disguised himself as a news cameraman and detonated explosives near a group of journalists, according to Stanekzai.\nAfghan IS affiliate group Khorasan Province claimed responsibility for the attacks in a statement on an IS-affiliated website. The statement said the first bomb was aimed at the headquarters of the renegade Afghan intelligence services, according to AP. The second bomber detonated his explosive vest after officers arrived on the scene, according to the statement. It did not mention journalists specifically being targeted.\nReporters Without Borders, a Paris-based media monitoring group also known by its French acronym RSF, said that since 2016, 36 media workers have been killed in Afghanistan in attacks by the Taliban or IS.\nThe U.S. and NATO ended their combat missions in Afghanistan at the end of 2014; Afghan security forces have been primarily fighting the Taliban and IS since. Both groups aim to establish Islamic rule in the country. \nRecent attacks in Afghanistan\n\n\tApril 28: A car bomb in Afghanistan's southern Helmand province killed at least six people, including two soldiers. No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack, CNN reported.\n\tApril 22: At least 57 people were killed, including at least 5 children, and more than 100 were injured in a suicide bombing at a voter registration center.

      "Content": "How significant is the 2018-2019 UN budget cut?\nAfter the U.S. Mission to the U.N. announced the organization had agreed to reduce the biennial budget by $285 million, some media outlets suggested the cut was: 1) significant and 2) due to President Trumps influence. Although we may not know the degree of influence Trump had on the budget cut, we can look at the organizations budget system, how its funding is allocated and how its budget has changed over time. Adding context to the coverage may help us evaluate the medias take on the news.\nHow is the U.N. funded?\nEach of the U.N.s 193-member nations contributes to its biennial budget, which currently starts in January of an even-numbered year (the budget process has changed over time). The amount contributed by each member depends on its gross national income (GNI), conversion rates, national debt and other factors. Overall, each member state funds between 0.001 and 22 percent of the budget.\nHere are the top five contributors, based on 2015 data.\n\n\n\n\nCountry\n\n\nU.N. budget contribution\n\n\n\n\nUnited States\n\n\n22%\n\n\n\n\nJapan\n\n\n9.680%\n\n\n\n\nChina\n\n\n7.921%\n\n\n\n\nGermany\n\n\n6.389%\n\n\n\n\nFrance\n\n\n4.859%\n\n\n\n\nThe U.N. Committee on Contributions establishes the budget contribution rates, and meets annually to review its methodology.\nMembers and non-members may also voluntarily contribute to U.N. programs such as the U.N. Development Program (UNDP) and the U.N. Childrens Fund (UNICEF). According to the U.N., Japan contributed the most voluntary funds in 2016, at $382,512,042. Voluntary funding contributions are not included in the biennial budget.\nWhat happens if a member state doesnt contribute?\nUnder the U.N. charter, if a member state doesnt pay its dues in an amount that equals or exceeds the contributions due for two preceding years, it can lose its ability to vote on U.N. matters in the General Assembly. However, some exceptions may be made for a country thats unable to pay due to conditions beyond its control.\nThe U.S. has not paid its U.N. dues on time on multiple occasions. For example, the U.S. owed about $1.2 billion to the organization in 2010. The U.S. was also considered in arrears to the U.N. in 1998, when it owed about $1 billion, and in 2015 when it owed over $2 billion. In those cases, the U.S. eventually paid its dues and did not lose its voting rights. \nHave there been previous budget cuts?\nAccording to NPR, the U.N.s 2016-2017 budget was about $400 million less than the funding appropriations for 2014-2015 (a larger reduction that the one agreed upon for 2018-2019). The budget for 2012-2013 was about $260 million less than the budget for 2010-2011. NPR also notes that the countries that contribute the most typically attempt to reduce the U.N.s budget each biennial. \nThe US fights hard, together with other countries, every year to cut UN budget  below is a sampling of those sections with their corresponding funding appropriation:\n\n\tSection 4: Disarmament: $24,950,700\n\tSection 6: Peaceful uses of outer space: $7,162,300\n\tSection 7: International Court of Justice: $45,975,700\n\tSection 10: Issues relating to the least developed countries, landlocked developing countries and small island developing States: $10,912,500\n\tSection 12: Trade and development: $135,159,400\n\tSection 14: Environmental issues: $35,331,400\n\tSection 15: Human settlement programs: $20,806,800\n\tSection 16: International drug control, crime and terrorism prevention and criminal justice: $36,917,600\n\tSection 17: Womens issues: $15,256,400\n\tSection 18: Economic and social development in Africa: $153,650,300\n\tSection 19: Economic and social development in Asia and the Pacific: $94,646,200\n\tSection 20: Economic development in Europe: $64,870,900\n\tSection 21: Economic and social development in Latin America and the Caribbean: $105,299,700\n\tSection 22: Economic and social development in Western Asia: $69,369,400\n\tSection 24: Human rights: $191,574,900\n\tSection 25: International protection, solutions and assistance to refugees: $82,204,900\n\tSection 26: Palestinian refugees: $55,592,900\n\tSection 27: Humanitarian assistance: $30,402,300\n",

The storm caused over two feet of rain and flash flooding on areas of the Big Island Thursday night into Friday morning. The National Weather Service predicted that the storm would turn west away from the islands by Saturday. No injuries have been reported.\nAt the request of Hawaiian Gov. David Ige, President Donald Trump authorized the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) on Wednesday to help with disaster relief efforts resulting from the hurricane. The Hawaii Department of Transportation reported downed trees, power outages and road closures affecting multiple islands on Thursday as a result of the storm.\nBefore it leaves the Hawaiian coast, the storm may move over the other main Hawaiian islands. Heavy rains and flooding may still affect the area throughout the weekend. The National Weather Service said Lane may lead to catastrophic and life-threatening flash flooding and landslides, producing total rain accumulations of 10 to 20 inches in some areas and up to 40 inches possible over local portions of the Hawaiian islands in the days to come. \nThe National Weather Service also warned of a prolonged period of high surf and coastal erosion as a result of the storm: The combination of storm surge and large breaking waves is expected to raise water levels well above normal tide levels as Hurricane Lane makes its closest approach. This is expected to result in significant beach erosion and overwash onto vulnerable coastal roadways through Saturday.\nA hurricane warning remains in effect for the islands of Oahu, Maui, Lanai, Molokai and Kahoolawe; the islands of Kauai and Niihau are under a hurricane watch.

The U.S. Treasury said the sanctions apply to individuals whom the department says benefit from Putins leadership and allegedly play a key role in advancing Russias malign activities. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said these activities include Russias occupation of Crimea, providing weapons to President Bashar al-Assads forces in Syria, alleged malicious cyber activities and so-called attempting to subvert Western democracies.\nThe Treasurys action freezes all assets subject to U.S. jurisdiction and prohibits Americans from dealing with the sanctioned Russian individuals and corporations. Non-U.S. persons could be subject to sanctions as well if they facilitate transactions for the individuals or entities sanctioned.\nFridays sanctions were issued under the authority of the Countering Americas Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA), and three executive orders. In January of this year, the Treasury issued a report that named 210 Russians who were allegedly linked to the Russian government.

      "Content": "U.S. President Donald Trump directed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to closely study the land and farm seizures and large scale killing of farmers in South Africa, the president announced on Twitter on Wednesday night. He did not cite evidence of large scale killings. South Africa, which is in the process of amending its constitution to allow redistribution of land from the white minority, responded that Trump was misinformed, and said on Twitter the viewpoint only seeks to divide our nation. \nThe ruling party in South Africa, the African National Congress (ANC), is currently going through a process to amend the constitution to allow the government to reallocate land from some white people without compensation. Currently, about 9 percent of the population of South Africa is white, while about 72 percent of the farmland is owned by whites, according to government totals. A law from 1913 had granted the majority of fertile farming land to whites, and land reform has been discussed since the end of Apartheid in 1994. \nIn February of this year, the South African parliament voted 241 to 83 to pursue amending the constitution for the proposed land reform. The bill had the ANCs support, though was introduced by another party. The vote directed a governmental committee to review the constitution and report back to the government by Aug. 30. President Cyril Ramaphosa said the matter would be handled with care and responsibility and wouldnt be a smash and grab.\nPrior to the plans to change the constitution, starting in 1994, land has been redistributed through a system of volunteer white owners selling to volunteer black buyers. That system has resulted in about 10 percent of white owned land changing to black owners, BBC reported. No land has been transferred from whites to blacks through force, according to the South African government. \nTrumps tweet\nTrump tweeted Wednesday night, I have asked Secretary of State @SecPompeo to closely study the South Africa land and farm seizures and expropriations and the large scale killing of farmers. South African Government is now seizing land from white farmers. The president tagged Fox News and its commentator Tucker Carlson in the tweet. \nTrumps tweet followed a Carlson segment on Fox News about the land seizures, calling them racist and saying they were stealing land from whites based on their skin color. The segment also discussed what happened in Zimbabwe when it went through land reform, including violence against white farmers and economic downturn. \nAdvocates against land appropriation\nThe South African non-profit group AfriForum, which advocates for minority rights, especially the rights of Afrikaners (Dutch-descended South Africans), said in a statement that it welcomes Trumps statement. Representatives of the group had previously visited the U.S. and met with Carlson and U.S.-based think tank the Cato Institute about the issue, AfriForum said, as well as engaged in other international advocacy.\nAfriForum also alleged that the ANC continues to den[y] the fact that farm murders, which are proportionally significantly higher than SAs average murder rate, is a unique crisis that requires specific attention.\nMurder rates on farms are the highest they have been since 2011, according to the best available data cited by BBC. Between April 2016 and March 2017, 74 people were murdered on farms (counting all races, and including farm employees and owners), South Africa's Police Service said, up from 58 the prior year. \nThe exact number of farmers and farm workers is not known, but based on estimates of the total people employed in agriculture, this would be the equivalent of 9.1 out of every 100,000 people. If it counts only commercial farmers, it would be the equivalent of 156 per 100,000, according to AfriForum. \nIn the overall population, in the 2016 to 2017 period more than 19,000 people were murdered, equivalent to about 34 of every 100,000 people. \nGovernment response\nA couple hours after Trumps comments, the South African government tweeted, South Africa totally rejects this narrow perception which only seeks to divide our nation and reminds us of our colonial past. #landexpropriation, tagging Trump. The government would take up the matter through diplomatic channels, said a spokesperson for President Cyril Ramaphosa.\n\nEarlier this week, Ramaphosa called on parliament to quicken the process of amending the constitution, noting again the land reform would be handled with care.\nAs South Africans we must move away from this fear psychosis that has been going around, particularly those that have been spreading lies and rumours, Ramaphosa said. Organizations like AfriForum going overseas and saying that the ANC is out for a land grab.\n\nSources: AfriForum, AP, BBC, BBC, Fox News, Reuters",

      "Content": "On Saturday, President Donald Trump tweeted that it was inconceivable that a lawyer would tape a client. His current lawyer Rudy Giuliani said Trump did not know he was being recorded in a September 2016 conversation with his then-personal lawyer Michael Cohen about former Playboy model Karen McDougal. McDougal has said she had an affair with Trump in 2006; Trump has denied it. \nIn August 2016, American Media Inc. (AMI), which owns the National Enquirer, bought the rights to McDougals story for $150,000 and did not run it, the Wall Street Journal reported. Giuliani said the arrangement involved a non-disclosure agreement. \nSituations in which payments are made to keep stories from becoming public are sometimes called catch-and-kill.If a catch-and-kill payment is made by a corporation, specifically to aid a presidential campaign, such a payment could be in violation of federal election laws. \nIn 2016, Cohen, through a company he set up, paid $130,000 to adult actress Stephanie Clifford (known as Stormy Daniels) as part of an agreement not to discuss an affair she said she had with Trump in 2006. Trump denied the affair. Trump later personally reimbursed Cohen for unspecified expenses. Giuliani said Cohens payment was about personal reputation. The money wasnt paid to help the campaign or hurt the campaign. He added that Trump had Cohen on a retainer and didnt know about the specifics to which his payment to Cohen related.\nOn Nov. 4, 2016, the Journal published an article about AMIs deal with McDougal. The article quoted Trumps campaign spokeswoman at the time, Hope Hicks, as saying, We have no knowledge of any of this.\nIn his recorded September 2016 conversation with Trump, Cohen recommended buying the rights from AMI, and Trump asked how they might do that, according to a source familiar with the tape cited by CNN.\nGiuliani said Friday that nothing in that conversation suggests that [Trump] had any knowledge of it [AMIs payment to McDougal] in advance. Giuliani said that in the taped conversation, Trump had mentioned that any payment \"to reimburse AMI for what they laid out should be done by check, properly recorded.\" No such payment occurred, according to Giuliani. In the big scheme of things, its powerful exculpatory evidence [for Trump], he added.\nThe FBI seized the recording along with other documents from Cohens office in April under a search warrant. The Justice Department is investigating Cohen over personal business dealings. He has not been charged with a crime in the case.\nA special master decided that 2,633 out of 900,000 documents seized by the FBI from Cohen qualified as privileged or partially privileged, CNBC reported. According to the State Bar of California, special masters are court-appointed attorneys who examine seized evidence that has been in possession or under the control of attorneys. Special masters balance the interests of the attorneys and their clients in protecting privileged materials with the interests of prosecutors in securing evidence of suspected criminal activity. \nA special master deemed the Trump-Cohen recording to be client-attorney privileged, CNN reported. Trumps lawyers later requested the privilege be withdrawn, meaning the recording could be used in the governments investigation of Cohen. \nComments on the recording\nOn Saturday morning, Trump tweeted, Inconceivable that the government would break into a lawyers office (early in the morning) - almost unheard of. Even more inconceivable that a lawyer would tape a client - totally unheard of  just as is #Trumps false #Twitter statement made against @michaelcohen212 this morning. Rudy claims the tape is exculpatory. Why so angry?\nAsked about Davis' tweet, Giuliani said, \"How would you feel if your lawyer was recording you without telling you?,\" CNN reported. Giuliani added that Trump's \"tweet is straightforward and correct.\"\nIn April, AMI published a statement that said, Ms. McDougal has always been free to talk about her relationship with President Trump  at least since her 2016 amendment of her contract with AMI  as her 90 minute interview with Anderson Cooper [in March, 2018] made clear. According to The New York Times, AMI amended its agreement with McDougal in 2016 after the presidential election in 2016.\nSources: American Media, Inc., CNBC, CNN, Fox News, The New York Times 1, The New York Times 2, The New York Times 3, The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post 1, The Washington Post 2",

Haspel had been called to the White House on Friday to answer questions from officials, including questions about her role in interrogations that used waterboarding and other coercive interrogation techniques, according to the Post. Haspel said she did not want her nomination to hurt the CIA or to have attacks on her reputation, the Post reported. \nAfter learning Haspel was considering withdrawing her nomination, White House Director of Legislative Affairs Marc Short and White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders traveled to Haspels office in Langley, Virginia, to meet with her. After the discussions, Haspel decided to continue with her nomination, according to the Post.\nHaspel, 61, was nominated to the position of CIA director by President Donald Trump in March. Haspel is the CIAs deputy director and has been the agencys acting director since former Director Mike Pompeo left the position to become U.S. Secretary of State. She has worked with the CIA since 1985, and has been undercover for some of her tenure. Haspels Senate confirmation hearing begins Wednesday with the Senate Intelligence Committee. After confirmation hearings, nominations are put to a vote in the Senate. \nHaspel is the first woman to be nominated as CIA director and, if confirmed, will be the first woman to lead the CIA.\n2002 CIA interrogations\nIn 2002, Haspel was overseeing a CIA detention facility in Thailand where terror suspect Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri was interrogated, at one point with waterboarding. Another suspect, Abu Zubaydah, was interrogated at the same facility before Haspel arrived. At the time, the interrogation program was authorized by the president, deemed legal by administration lawyers and briefed to members of Congress, according to the Post. During his presidency, Barack Obama signed executive orders to end CIA secret prisons and ban coercive interrogation methods. \nHaspel later served as chief of staff to Jose Rodriguez, who headed the CIAs clandestine operations. In 2005, he reportedly ordered videotapes of the interrogations to be destroyed and Haspels name was on the order. The destruction of the tapes was investigated by a special prosecutor and ultimately no charges were filed.\nSources: Fox News, Politico, The New York Times 1, The New York Times 2, The Washington Post, Vox\n",

      "Content": "On Tuesday, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) announced $12 billion in emergency aid to farmers affected by retaliatory overseas tariffs. White House officials said payments to farmers will begin in September. The aid does not require congressional approval and would include direct payments to farmers, funding to promote American agricultural goods in other countries, and more money for an existing program to purchase food and distribute it to food banks and other organizations, according to The Washington Post.\nDepending on the program, farm goods eligible for aid would include soybeans, wheat, milk, legumes and nuts, Bloomberg reported. \nPortions of the aid would be distributed under a program created in 1933 called the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC), which is part of the USDA. The CCC spends more than $10 billion annually on programs such as trade promotion and surplus farm goods purchases. Trumps proposed 2019 budget would have decreased CCC funding, the Post reported. \nThe U.S. is projected to have a trade surplus of $21 billion in agriculture this year, according to Bloomberg. The three largest buyers of U.S. agricultural goods are Canada, China and Mexico. In 2017, the three countries accounted for 43 percent of purchases of U.S. farm goods. All three countries have imposed retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods, including agricultural products, in response to steel and aluminum tariffs the U.S. imposed on them.\nTariffs\nIn April, China imposed tariffs on $2.97 billion worth of U.S. imports, including pork, in response to the U.S. 10 percent tariff on aluminum and 25 percent tariff on steel imports from China. \nEarlier this month, the U.S. imposed 25 percent tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese goods in response to the countrys policies and practices related to technology transfer, intellectual property, and innovation being unreasonable or discriminatory and burden[ing] or restrict[ing] U.S. commerce, according to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. China imposed tariffs on $34 billion worth of U.S. imports in response. Among the 545 U.S. goods on which China imposed tariffs were beef, soybeans, dairy and other farm goods. \nLast Friday, Trump said he was ready to go regarding the imposition of tariffs on $500 billion worth of Chinese goods in the future if China continued to impose retaliatory tariffs and trade measures on U.S. goods.\nAgriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said the temporary farm aid measures were necessary to send \"a firm statement that other nations cannot bully our agriculture producers to force the United States to cave in.\nEarlier this year, Trump ordered Perdue to formulate a plan to compensate farmers for lost sales and lower prices as a result of other countries retaliatory tariffs.\nAt a speech Tuesday in Missouri, President Donald Trump said of his trade policies, The farmers will be the biggest beneficiary. Watch, we are opening up markets, you watch what is going to happen, just be a little patient.\nResponse to the USDA aid announcement\nPresident of the American Farm Bureau Federation Zippy Duvall said the aid \"will provide a welcome measure of temporary relief to our farmers and ranchers. \nBut we cannot overstate the dire consequences that farmers and ranchers are facing in relation to lost export markets, and we will continue to push for a swift and sure end to the trade war, he added.\nOn Tuesday, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) tweeted, If tariffs punish farmers, the answer is not welfare for farmers. The answer is remove the tariffs.\nSen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) said, The trade war is cutting the legs out from under farmers and White Houses plan is to spend $12 billion on gold crutches. Americas farmers dont want to be paid to lose  they want to win by feeding the world.\nHouse Agriculture Committee Chairman K. Michael Conaway (R-Texas) said, in apparent reference to China, Our president stood up to a bully; now hes standing up for rural America. This is the right fight to have, but in the meantime, our producers have got to ... live, while this fights going on.\nOn Tuesday morning, Trump tweeted, Tariffs are the greatest! Either a country which has treated the United States unfairly on Trade negotiates a fair deal, or it gets hit with Tariffs. Its as simple as that - and everybodys talking! Remember, we are the piggy bank thats being robbed. All will be Great!\nSources: Bloomberg 1, Bloomberg 2, The New York Times, The Washington Post 1, The Washington Post 2",

      "Content": "On Friday, Tesla, Inc. released a statement saying its Autopilot driver-assistance system was engaged before a fatal Model X accident in Mountain View, California on March 23. The driver, Wei Huang, died after the crash. Tesla said the system had produced multiple visual and one audible hands-on warning earlier in the drive, and that Huangs hands were not on the wheel for six seconds prior to the collision with a concrete roadside barrier. Tesla said it was incredibly sorry to the drivers family and friends for their loss.\nThe company released a statement four days after the Model X crash, saying it had not yet recovered the sport utility vehicles logs. The company said its data showed Tesla drivers had driven the same stretch of highway with Autopilot engaged roughly 85,000 times since Autopilot was first rolled out in 2015 and roughly 20,000 times since just the beginning of the year, and there has never been an accident that we know of. \nA week after the crash, Tesla released another statement, indicating it had recovered the vehicles logs. Tesla then said, The driver had about five seconds and 150 meters of unobstructed view of the concrete divider with the crushed crash attenuator, but the vehicle logs show that no action was taken.\nThe National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) and the California Highway Patrol (CHP) were investigating the accident. After Teslas statement, NTSB spokesman Chris ONeil said, In each of our investigations involving a Tesla vehicle, Tesla has been extremely cooperative on assisting with the vehicle data. However, the NTSB is unhappy with the release of investigative information by Tesla. ONeil added that NTSBs preliminary report generally occurs within a few weeks of completion of field work.\nThe accident\nThe accident on Highway 101 occurred at 9:27 a.m. local time, according to Tesla. The Model X SUV caught fire after the accident. Tesla said, by witnesses accounts, we understand there were no occupants still in the Model X by the time the fire could have presented a risk. \nThe highway crash attenuator the SUV hit had been damaged in a previous accident. An accident had occurred there 11 days prior, according to the CHP. ABC7 News did not say if the CHP indicated that accident caused the damage to the attenuator, which was apparent in photos posted by Tesla.\nHuang, 38, was an Apple engineer. His family said he had previously talked to his Tesla dealer about an issue while driving in Autopilot whereby his car steered towards the same barrier 7/10 times that he would drive on that road, according to ABC7 News. Huangs brother, Will, said the dealer was unable to duplicate the issue.\nTeslas Autopilot system\nTeslas Autopilot is described as an advanced driver assistance system that uses a series of cameras, ultrasonic sensors and radar along with software to drive the vehicle semi-autonomously under certain conditions. In the Tesla Model S owners manual, some of the conditions under which the autopilot system may be unable to function as intended include poor visibility, bright lights, narrow or winding roads, and mud, snow or ice on the sensors. The manual includes this warning: It is the driver's responsibility to stay alert, drive safely, and be in control of the vehicle at all times. \nA survey of 625 German Tesla owners published in November 2016 found that 98 percent of respondents said they were familiar with the car warnings that Tesla provides about how Autopilot is to be properly used. Seven percent said the name Autopilot caused [them] to believe that the car is fully autonomous, meaning that it does not require the driver to be supervising the car.\nTesla said a review by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) published in January 2017 found that Autopilot reduces crash rates by 40 percent. The NHTSAs study included crash rates before and after Autopilot had been installed, which were determined using air bag and mileage data from Tesla Model S and Model X vehicles. The crash rates after Autopilot was installed included driving both with and without the driver assistance system activated. Tesla said Autopilot has improved further since the study and that perfectly prevent[ing] all accidents is a standard that would be impossible.\nOther fatalities involving self-driving vehicles\nIn 2016, a Tesla Model S crashed into a truck while in Autopilot mode. In that accident, Tesla said neither Autopilot nor the driver noticed the white side of the tractor trailer against a brightly lit sky, so the brake was not applied. The NHTSA report concluded the driver should have been able to see the tractor trailer for at least seven seconds prior to the crash. After the accident, Tesla changed its Autopilot software so the system would shut off for the remainder of the trip if a driver fails to respond to the [systems] alerts adequately, according to the NHTSA.ing to the NHTSA.\nOn March 18 in Arizona, an Uber self-driving vehicle hit and killed a pedestrian walking her bicycle across the street away from a crosswalk at night. Video of the incident shows neither the person sitting in the drivers seat nor the self-driving system appeared to brake before the impact. Uber has not said what caused the accident.\nCrash statistics\nTesla said, on average, there is a fatality once every 86 million miles in the U.S. across all vehicles from all manufacturers. Tesla said for its vehicles equipped with Autopilot hardware, the number is one in every 320 million miles. It concluded, if you are driving a Tesla equipped with Autopilot hardware, you are 3.7 times less likely to be involved in a fatal accident. It did not provide total number of fatalities or miles driven. About a year ago, Tesla said it had four billion miles of driving data from its cars, not all with autopilot installed, according to Electrek.\nIn 2016, 37,461 people died on U.S. roads, including pedestrians, bicyclists and motorcyclists, as well as automobile drivers and passengers, according to the NHTSA. The administration said 3.2 trillion miles had been driven in the U.S. in 2016. \nTesla was founded in 2003. It released its first electric Roadster in 2008.\nSources: BBC, CNN, The New York Times, The Washington Post",

      "Content": "In a statement Wednesday, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the military mission to eradicate the Islamic State (IS) in Syria is coming to a rapid end, with the group almost completely destroyed. She said the U.S. and its partners remain committed to eliminating the small IS presence in Syria that our forces have not already eradicated. She added that the U.S. expect[s] some countries and the U.N. to work toward peace and ensure that IS never re-emerges.\nIn her statement, Sanders also said, We will continue to consult with our allies and friends regarding future plans.\nTrump has not approved a specific timetable for withdrawal, according to an official cited by Reuters.\nLast Thursday in a speech on infrastructure in Ohio, President Donald Trump said, Were knocking the hell out of ISIS, and, Well be coming out of Syria, like, very soon. Let the other people take care of it now.\nOn Saturday, Trump directed the State Department to stop $200 million of recovery aid for Syria while the U.S. reconsidered its policy in the country.\nOn Tuesday, Gen. Joseph L. Votel, head of the U.S. Central Command overseeing American operations in Syria, said, A lot of very good military progress was made over the last couple years. He added, the hard part I think is in front of us, and that is stabilizing these areas, consolidating our gains, getting people back into their homes, addressing the long-term issues of reconstruction. He said, there is a military role in this, certainly in the stabilization phase.\nAn American-led coalition has been combatting IS in Syria since 2014. About 2,000 U.S. troops remain stationed there. U.S. troops work with the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a group of Kurdish and Arab militias. U.S. air strikes have helped SDF gain control of tens of thousands of square kilometers from IS over the past three years, according to BBC.\nOfficials in the global coalition fighting IS said the group has lost 98 percent of the land it once controlled in Syria and Iraq, BBC reported. Votel said that more than 90 percent of territory that was IS-controlled in 2014 has been taken back by the U.S.-led coalition. IS currently controls some territory in eastern Syria, in the Euphrates River Valley, according to BBC. Some Kurdish fighters who had been combatting IS there are now fighting Turkish troops in the northwestern Afrin region of Syria.\nSources: AP, BBC, Fox News, Reuters, The New York Times",

      "Content": "Israeli and Palestinian forces agreed to return to calm after an Israeli soldier and four members of the Palestinian organization Hamas were killed on Friday. After the Israeli was killed near the border fence with Gaza by a Palestinian gunman, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) responded with airstrikes and tank and artillery fire against the Hamas Islamist organization, which governs Gaza. Four Palestinians, members of Hamas, were killed by Israeli fire, according to Hamas military division. \n\nEveryone in Gaza needs to step back from the brink, the U.N.'s Middle East envoy, Nikolay Mladenov, tweeted on Friday. Not next week. Not tomorrow. Right NOW! Those who want to provoke Palestinians and Israelis into another war must not succeed.\nLater on Friday, Israeli and Palestinian forces agreed to return to the era of calm, according to Hamas spokesman Fawzi Barhoum. He said the agreement was reached with Egyptian and United Nations efforts. \nProtests by tens of thousands of Palestinians, organized by Hamas along the Gaza border, began on March 30. Protesters are calling for the right to return for Palestinians whose ancestors lived in Israel before the May 1948 war between Israel and neighboring countries. Israel has not granted Palestinians the right to return.\nSince the protests began, at least 130 Palestinians have died and 15,000 have been injured by Israeli forces, according to Gaza health officials. The soldiers death on Friday was Israels first fatality for an active duty soldier since the protests began.\nIsrael has used snipers and airstrikes against Hamas. Palestinians have fired mortar and rockets against Israeli communities, and some have sent flaming kites and balloons across the border into southern Israel. The incendiary devices have reportedly burned 2,500 acres of parks and reserves. Israeli forces have also fired live ammunition and tear gas at protesters. \nThe IDF said that on Friday it had eliminated about 60 buildings and infrastructures and revoked significant military and command and control capabilities. \nEarlier this week, Israel announced temporary restrictions on fuel cargo crossing with the Gaza Strip, in response to what Israel called continued terror attempts by the Palestinian group Hamas, citing the use of incendiary devices. Last week, Israel restricted other goods from entering Gaza; it is permitting food and medicine to be delivered. \nOn June 13, the U.N. General Assembly passed a resolution saying it deplores the use of excessive, disproportionate and indiscriminate force by Israel against Palestinian civilians, particularly in the Gaza strip. The U.S. voted against the measure, which does not mention Hamas by name, with the U.S. ambassador to the U.N. saying, it does no one any good to pretend that all blame lies on one side.\nSources: BBC, Haaretz, The New York Times",

      "Content": "As of Monday, independent international inspectors have not been granted access to inspect the site of an alleged April 7 chemical attack in the Syrian town of Douma that reportedly killed between 40 and 70 people. A team from the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) arrived in the capital city of Damascus, about 11 miles west of Douma, on Saturday. The OPCW team arrived the same day that the U.S., the U.K. and France conducted airstrikes on targets they say are associated with a Syrian chemical weapons program. Syria denied using chemical weapons. \nThe OPCW team has not yet deployed to Douma two days after arriving in Syria, OPCW Director-General Ahmet Uzumcu told the organizations executive council. Uzumcu said that he hoped the team would be permitted to deploy to Douma as soon as possible. He said Syrian and Russian officials have stated that there were still pending security issues to be worked out before any deployment could take place. \nSyrian authorities granted the OPCW team access to 22 witnesses, according to Uzumcu. The OPCW executive council meeting was closed to the public, though the body released a prepared statement by Uzumcu. The U.K.s OPCW delegation also tweeted that access has been denied. \nDeputy Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said that the OPCW team could not access the site until it had permission from the United Nations Department for Safety and Security, since the U.S., U.K. and France conducted airstrikes on the area over the weekend. \nU.N. spokesman Stphane Dujarric said the U.N. has provided the necessary clearances for the OPCW team to go about its work in Douma. We have not denied the team any request for it to go to Douma.\nThe Syrian government invited the OPCW inspectors to the site last Tuesday. A Syrian representative, Deputy Foreign Minister Faisal Mekdad, said government officials have met with the OPCW team multiple times, and the government is fully ready to cooperate with the inspectors.\nRussian and Syrian forces have been deployed to Douma, AP reported. The town has reportedly been evacuated of all rebel forces. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said, I can guarantee that Russia has not tampered with the site.\nRussian Ministry of Defense spokesperson Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov told reporters last Friday that the attack was staged, and people in recordings of the alleged attack were actually patients with smoke poisoning. \nThe U.S. Department of Defense has said the U.S. is very confident that Syria is responsible for the alleged chemical attack. Pentagon spokeswoman Dana White responded to a question about why the U.S. has not shared the evidence, saying, a lot of this has to do with intelligence.\nSources: AP, The New York Times",

The tweet came after Iranian President Hassan Rouhani criticized the U.S. withdrawal from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, and said war with Iran is the mother of all wars. \nRouhani, at a meeting of Iranian diplomats in the Iranian capital city of Tehran on Sunday, said, America should know that peace with Iran is the mother of all peace, and war with Iran is the mother of all wars. He said, Mr. Trump, dont play with the lions tail, this would only lead to regret.\nYou [Trump] cannot provoke the Iranian people against their own security and interests, Rouhani said in a televised speech from the meeting. \nThe U.S. is scheduled to resume economic sanctions against Iran in August, which had been removed under the terms of the nuclear deal, formally called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). Iran and the remaining five signatories on the deal (the U.K, China, France, Germany and Russia) have been in negotiations to establish new terms in the deal to compensate for the U.S. decision to resume sanctions. Rouhani alleged the U.S. was interfering in Irans negotiations with the EU countries, Iranian state news agency INRA reported, without elaborating on what the alleged interference was.\nDespite provoking the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to take actions against Iran, they failed to do so and then the US embarked on another approach, namely to persuade the EU to review the Iran Deal, Rouhani said. The JCPOA was tantamount to defeat of 12 years of conspiracies against Iran's acquisition of the nuclear technology, and was the unified decision of all pillars of the establishment in Iran.\nFollowing Rouhanis remarks, Trumps full tweet said, To Iranian President Rouhani: NEVER, EVER THREATEN THE UNITED STATES AGAIN OR YOU WILL SUFFER CONSEQUENCES THE LIKES OF WHICH FEW THROUGHOUT HISTORY HAVE EVER SUFFERED BEFORE. WE ARE NO LONGER A COUNTRY THAT WILL STAND FOR YOUR DEMENTED WORDS OF VIOLENCE  DEATH. BE CAUTIOUS!\nBolton said in a statement released by the White House on Monday that he had spoken to the president over the last several days. President Trump told me that if Iran does anything at all to the negative, they will pay a price like few countries have ever paid before, Bolton said. Neither Trump nor Bolton specified what actions the U.S. would take against Iran. \nAlso on Sunday, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the U.S. would pursue a \"diplomatic and economic pressure campaign\" on Iran, adding that the Trump administration was seeking to limit Iranian crude exports \"as close to zero as possible by November 4. He added that Trump was \"willing to talk\" to the Iranian government if it showed signs of change. \nMore information on JCPOA is available here.\nA timeline of Irans nuclear program is available here.\nSources: IRNA, IRNA, NPR, PressTV",

The tunnel also ran underneath the Kerem Shalom border crossing, which is a main route between Israeli territories and Gaza. \nReuters reported that residents in Gaza said Israeli jets bombed the southern town of Rafah late on Saturday night. Palestinian sources said that a tunnel was the target of the attack, according to Haaretz. Hamas, an Islamic political group that controls Gaza and has an armed wing, did not immediately respond to the bombing. \nPrior to the Israeli attack on Saturday, the Kerem Shalom border crossing was closed. \nIDF spokesman Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus confirmed on Sunday that the tunnel was destroyed and said necessary coordination was made with Egypt for the Israeli military operation. \nConricus said that because the tunnel ran under the border crossing, the IDF concluded the tunnel was designed for terror attacks rather than as a smuggling tunnel. Photos provided by the Israeli military showed the tunnel was made with concrete and wider than most tunnels used by Hamas for smuggling, according to CNN. Conricus did not specify how deep underground the tunnel ran or how long Israeli forces had monitored it before the airstrike.\nIsrael has on ongoing project to construct an underground wall with sensors along the Gaza border, which is approximately 36 miles (60 km). The wall is estimated to cost $1.1 billion and be completed in 2019. Israel said it has destroyed three tunnels since the end of October. \nSources: CNN, Haaretz, Reuters",

On Tuesday, District Judge Carlton Reeves issued a temporary restraining order that blocks the law from taking effect for 10 days. \nThe new law is called the Gestational Age Act. The states only abortion clinic, the Jackson Womens Health Organization, filed a complaint in United States District Court for Mississippis Southern District and is seeking a preliminary injunction to prevent officials from enforcing the act. \nThe court is considering further actions. Reeves, the judge who issued the temporarily block, said, a brief delay in enforcing a law of dubious constitutionality does not outweigh that harm, and in fact serves the public's interest in preserving the freedom guaranteed by the United States Constitution.\"\nPreviously, Mississippi law prohibited abortions past 20 weeks gestation. The Jackson Womens Health Organization did not perform abortions past 16 weeks, according to clinic owner Diane Derzis. \nAfter signing the bill, the governor wrote on Twitter, I am committed to making Mississippi the safest place in America for an unborn child, and this bill will help us achieve that goal.\nThe Center for Reproductive Rights, a New York-based abortion rights group, said in a news release that the Mississippi bill violated a Supreme Court precedent, established in Roe v. Wade, that states may not ban abortions before they are deemed viable outside the womb, including with artificial aid. This is typically considered between 24 to 26 weeks gestation, the group said. \nDefinitions\nThe Gestational Age Act defines medical emergency as a condition in which, on the basis of the physician's good faith clinical judgment, an abortion is necessary to preserve the life of a pregnant woman whose life is endangered by a physical disorder, physical illness, or physical injury, including a life-endangering physical condition arising from the pregnancy itself, or when the continuation of the pregnancy will create a serious risk of substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function. \nThe bills definition of severe fetal abnormality is a life-threatening physical condition that, in reasonable medical judgment, regardless of the provision of life-saving medical treatment, is incompatible with life outside the womb.\nSources: Gestational Age Act, The New York Times, NPR",

The budget was reduced by $285 million, or about 5 percent from the final 2016-2017 budget. The U.N. operating budget is separate from a peacekeeping budget that was reduced in June by $600 million to $6.8 billion for 2017-2018. \nAgence France-Presse reported two weeks ago that U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres had proposed a $200 million reduction from the 2016-2017 operating budget, and the U.S. proposed an additional $250 million decrease. Haleys office, the United States Mission, said the negotiated total decrease of $285 million was the result of reductions in travel expenses, consultant fees and the leasing of space outside the U.N. building in New York.\nThe 193 member countries of the U.N. are required to contribute to its budget amounts determined by a formula that factors each countrys population and gross national income. For 2016-2017, the U.S. paid about $1.2 billion, or 22 percent of the U.N.s $5.4 billion annual operating budget. The U.S. contributed approximately $2 billion, or about 28 percent of the peacekeeping budget this year.\nHaleys office released a statement saying the reduction in spending combined with moves towards a more efficient and accountable U.N. was a big step in the right direction. The statement added, well continue to look at ways to increase the U.N.s efficiency while protecting our interests.\nOn Dec. 6, President Donald Trump said the U.S. would recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and prepare to move the U.S. embassy there. Last week, the U.N. General Assembly voted 128-9 to demand that Jerusalems status remain unchanged; 35 nations abstained. \nBefore the vote, Haley said the U.S. will remember this day in which it was singled out in this assembly for the very act of exercising our right as a sovereign nation, adding it would remember this day when the U.S. is called upon to make the worlds largest contribution to the U.N.

(Read our previous coverage of initial reporting on the Cambridge Analytica story here.) \n\nBrian Acton, co-founder of WhatsApp, tweeted on Tuesday, It is time: #deletefacebook. WhatsApp is a messaging app that Facebook bought in 2014 for $19 billion. Acton reportedly made more than $3 billion in the sale; he left WhatsApp in 2017. The hashtags #DeleteFacebook, #QuitFacebook and #BoycottFacebook have been used on the social media platform Twitter this week. \nOn March 16, Facebook said it was suspending the accounts of Cambridge Analytica, psychology professor Aleksandr Kogan and others involved in transferring to Cambridge Analytica some Facebook users data in what Facebook said was a violation of its policies. Kogan had developed an app called thisisyourdigitallife, which was voluntarily downloaded by about 270,000 users who shared information with the app. The app accessed data from the accounts of the Facebook friends of those users for a total of 50 million users.\nSince Facebook announced the situation last week, it has lost about $59 billion to its market cap. The companys stock price dropped about 7 percent on Monday, the largest decline in more than three years according to Forbes. \nFacebook has more than 2 billion active monthly users. In 2017, the companys revenue was greater than $40 billion, with $39.9 billion of that from advertising.\nFacebook announces steps to protect data\nZuckerberg said in his statement Wednesday that the company has a responsibility to protect your data, and if we cant then we dont deserve to serve you. He provided a timeline of events related to Cambridge Analytica, including changes to the companys policies in 2014, when the company limited the data that apps could access from a users Facebook friends to only data from friends who had authorized the app. \nThe company also required developers to get its approval before requesting any sensitive data from its users. Zuckerberg said these actions would prevent any app like Kogans from being able to access so much data today.\nZuckerberg also provided some of the steps Facebook would take in the future. The steps include a plan to investigate apps that had access to large amounts of information prior to its 2014 policy change, and a program to restrict developers data access even further by removing developers access to data from people who have not used their apps in 3 months, as well as other actions. \nZuckerberg also said Facebook would provide a tool next month for users to see which apps theyve used and give them an easy way to revoke apps permission to access their data.\nFTC review\nFacebook said it was informed by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) that the commission would send the company a letter this week with questions on the data that Cambridge Analytica acquired from its site, according to Reuters. Facebook said it had not been informed of a formal investigation by the FTC. \nThe FTC is reviewing a 2011 consent decree it had with Facebook over privacy practices to see if the company violated the terms of the decree, Reuters reported. If it determines Facebook did violate the decree, the FTC could fine the social media company.\nExternal audit\nFacebook had hired an outside forensics company, Stroz Freidberg, to audit Cambridge Analyticas data, and Cambridge Analytica had agreed to the audit. The U.K. Information Commissioners Office requested that Facebook not audit Cambridge Analytica and said the office was seeking a warrant to investigate the company, according to Forbes.\nRead more about the timeline of events here.\nSources: Forbes, Fox News, HuffPost, The Guardian",

      "Content": "Ethiopian Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn announced on Thursday he would step down, citing ongoing unrest and political crisis in the country. He said he would also resign as the chairman of the ruling coalition, the Ethiopian Peoples Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF). \nUnrest and political crisis have led to the loss of lives and displacement of many, Hailemariam said in a televised address. I see my resignation as vital in the bid to carry out reforms that would lead to sustainable peace and democracy. Protests since 2015 have led to hundreds of deaths.\nHailemariam, 52, is a former university dean and has been prime minister since 2012. He said he would temporarily fill the role of caretaker until Parliament named a new prime minister and EPRDF chair. The coalition, which controls every seat in Ethiopias 547-member parliament, accepted the prime ministers resignation and is scheduled to hold a session next month.\nProtests and state of emergency\nIn 2015, demonstrators in Ethiopias two largest regions, Oromia and Amhara, began protesting a government-backed urban development plan in the capital city of Addis Ababa. \nThe government planned to develop farmland belonging to the Oromos, Ethiopias largest ethnic group, in order to expand the capital region. The Oromos make up about a third of Ethiopias population of 100 million, and there have been no Oromo representatives in Ethiopias current or past government leadership, CNN reported. \nThe government later ended its plan to expand the capital, but protests continued. Demonstrators called for political and economic reforms, and for the end of alleged state corruption.\nIn October 2016, the government implemented a six-month state of emergency, which was later extended to 10 months, after hundreds of people died during ongoing demonstrations. The United Nations has criticized Ethiopian authorities alleged use of lethal force against protestors. \nPolitical reforms \nIn January of this year, the Ethiopian government announced it would release political prisoners, including opposition figures and journalists detained for involvement in mass protests. Since then, more than 6,000 prisoners have been released. \nSince Monday, protesters in three regions of the country have demonstrated, demanding the release of all political prisoners, BBC reported.\nSources: BBC, CNN, Reuters",

      "Content": "On Sunday, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said she thinks she has at least five more years on the court before retirement. Ginsburg, 85, was nominated to the Supreme Court in 1993 by President Bill Clinton. The average retirement age of the last 11 justices was 80, according to The Washington Post. \nIm now 85, Ginsburg said. My senior colleague, Justice John Paul Stevens, he stepped down when he was 90, so think I have about at least five more years. \nJustice Anthony Kennedy, 82, announced last month he would retire effective July 31. President Donald Trump nominated Judge Brett Kavanaugh to replace Kennedy, sending his nomination to the Senate for the approval process. \nGinsburg was speaking in New York during a question-and-answer period after a production of The Originalist, an Off-Broadway play about the late Justice Antonin Scalia. In answering a question about people recently questioning the countrys institutions, she responded, My dear spouse used to say the true symbol of the U.S. is not a bald eagle. It is the pendulum, adding  when it goes very far in one direction, you can count on it coming back.\nThe genius of the constitution is it has become more and more inclusive, she also said on Sunday while discussing the issue of discrimination. Now, we the people, embraces all the people.\nSupreme Court appointments\nThe Supreme Court is made up of the chief justice and eight associate justices, appointed for life terms. The president has the authority to nominate the justices and the appointment is confirmed with the approval of the Senate, determined by a majority vote.\nThe Senate is made up of 100 seats, with Republicans currently holding 51 seats, Democrats holding 47 seats and two seats held by Independents, who caucus with the Democrats. \nThe Supreme Court currently consists of five justices appointed by Republican presidents and four appointed by Democratic presidents: \nJustices appointed by Republican presidents\nJohn G. Roberts, Jr., 63, Chief Justice, was nominated by then-President George W. Bush and took his seat on Sept. 29, 2005.\nAnthony M. Kennedy, 82, Associate Justice, was nominated by then-President Ronald Reagan and took his seat on Feb. 18, 1988.\nClarence Thomas, 70, Associate Justice, was nominated by then-President George H.W. Bush and took his seat on Oct. 23, 1991.\nSamuel A. Alito, Jr., 68, Associate Justice, was nominated by then-President George W. Bush and took his seat on Jan. 31, 2006.\nNeil M. Gorsuch, 50, Associate Justice, was nominated by President Donald Trump and took his seat on April 10, 2017.\nJustices appointed by Democratic presidents\nRuth Bader Ginsburg, 85, Associate Justice, was nominated by then-President Bill Clinton and took her seat on Aug. 10, 1993.\nStephen G. Breyer, 79, Associate Justice, was nominated by then-President Bill Clinton and took his seat on Aug. 3, 1994.\nSonia Sotomayor, 64, Associate Justice, was nominated by then-President Barack Obama and took her seat on Aug. 8, 2009.\nElena Kagan, 58, Associate Justice, was nominated by then-President Barack Obama and took her seat on Aug. 7, 2010.\nTrumps Supreme Court nominations\nAfter Kennedy announced his retirement, President Donald Trump nominated Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. Kavanaugh, 53, is currently a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for D.C. Kavanaugh is meeting with senators as part of the confirmation process. \nOn Monday, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) said he had met with Kavanaugh and would vote for his confirmation. He had previously said he was undecided.\nIn January of last year, Trump nominated Gorsuch to the Supreme Court to fill the seat left vacant after Scalias death in February 2016. Gorsuch was sworn in on April 10, 2017, after the Senate approved his nomination. \nSources: U.S. Supreme Court, CNN 1, CNN 2, Fox News, Politico, The Washington Post, TIME",

      "Content": "Italys foreign ministry summoned the French ambassador on Wednesday in response to French President Emmanuel Macrons comments regarding Italys denying entry to a rescue ship carrying 629 migrants. Macron had said the day prior that Italy had acted with cynicism and irresponsibility. The Italian foreign ministry said Macrons comments were unacceptable, and were undermining relations between Italy and France. Macron said the two countries should not give in to emotions.\nAlso on Wednesday, Italy canceled a planned meeting between the countrys economy minister and Frances finance minister, with neither office providing a reason for the cancellation. The ministers later agreed to reschedule their meeting, according to a French finance ministry official cited by Reuters.\nMacron and Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, who took office on June 1, are scheduled to meet Friday in Paris to discuss migration, among other topics. Italian news agency ANSA reported that the Macron-Conte meeting could be postponed; Contes office did not confirm the report. \nItalian Interior Minister Matteo Salvini said, If an official apology doesn't arrive [from France], Conte would be right not to go to France. France said it had not received a formal request from Italy for an apology, and that it continued to plan for a Friday meeting between Macron and Conte, Reuters reported. Macron said France was working hand in hand with Italy on the issue of migration.\nMigration in Europe\nMore than a million migrants have arrived in the European Union since 2015, most leaving the Syrian conflict and, according to the European Commission, up to 90 percent hired human smugglers. \nEU law stipulates that migrants seeking refugee status must apply for asylum in the country where they first enter Europe. The majority of migrants seeking asylum enter the EU through Italy or Greece. \nAccording to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), 362,000 migrants crossed the Mediterranean Sea in 2016: 181,400 arrived in Italy and 173,450 in Greece. Last year, the total figure of migrants entering Europe was about 105,000. Italy also has an estimated 500,000 unregistered migrants, Reuters reported. So far this year, about 33,700 have arrived, according to UNHCR figures, and about 771 are suspected to have drowned. \nIn May 2015, EU leaders drafted A European Agenda on Migration, which outlined commitments for EU countries to take certain numbers of refugees. It also outlined other projects to address migration, such as stopping human smugglers, increasing border security, simplifying the asylum process and providing development assistance to countries from which many of the migrants originate. In the 2015-2017 period, the EU allocated $20.3 billion (17.7 billion) of its budget to address migration issues, including providing humanitarian aid.\nSalvini, who is also deputy premier and leader of the League party, alleged before the Italian Senate on Wednesday that France had received 640 migrants of the 9,816 migrants it said it would take under a 2015 EU relocation plan. Some countries have received the number of migrants they said they would under the plan, while others have not, according to The Associated Press.\nA meeting of EU leaders is scheduled for June 28-29 in Brussels, with migration as one item on the agenda. Last December, EU leaders set the end of June 2018 as a deadline for ruling on a mechanism to handle migrants.\nMigrant ships\nOn Monday, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Snchez said his country would receive the 629 migrants aboard the Aquarius ship at Spains Valencia port, after Malta and Italy declined to allow the ship to dock. Italy said the ships passengers were not in danger and that other European countries should take the migrants.\nFilippo Grandi, the UNHCR high commissioner, said, Closing ports, whoever does it, threatens rescue at sea, as we have seen in the case of the Aquarius, and therefore is not the right solution. He added that the reason why Italy said it had closed ports is something we need to listen to.\nThe Aquarius, run by rescue group SOS Mditerrane, had rescued migrants from smaller boats in the Mediterranean off the coast of Libya on June 9. The Aquarius and two Italian naval ships escorting it are expected to arrive in Valencia on the night of June 16, weather conditions permitting, according to SOS Mditerrane co-founder Sophie Beau. \nOn Wednesday, a separate Italian coast guard ship carrying more than 930 migrants docked in Sicily.\nAdditionally, the U.S.S. Trenton rescued 41 migrants and recovered 12 bodies on Tuesday off the coast of Libya, during what is said was a routine operation. Sea Watch, a German non-governmental organization ship, said it had the resources to take those migrants if Italy agreed to open its ports to the Sea Watch.\nSources: AFP, AP, Fox News, EU Collection, Reuters, UNHCR",

      "Content": "Goldman Sachs on Tuesday named David Solomon as the companys next chief executive officer. Solomon will take over from current CEO Lloyd Blankfein on Oct. 1. Blankfein plans to retire as CEO on Sept. 30, and from his role as Chairman of the Board at the end of year.\nSolomon is the right person to lead Goldman Sachs, Blankfein said in the companys press release. He has demonstrated a proven ability to build and grow businesses, identified creative ways to enhance our culture and has put clients at the center of our strategy. Through the talent of our people and the quality of our client franchise, Goldman Sachs is poised to realize the next stage of growth.\nSolomon, 56, joined the company in 1999 after leaving Bear Stearns. He was promoted to head the companys investment banking division in July 2006. The division saw a 70 percent increase in sales under Solomons management, CNN reported.\nHe was promoted to co-president and co-chief operating officer in 2016. He shared the titles with Harvey Schwartz until Schwartz left the company in March 2018.\nSolomon also produces dance music under the moniker DJ D-Sol.\nBlankfein\nBlankfein, 63, started his career in finance as a commodities trader at J Aron  Co, which was bought by Goldman Sachs in 1981. He was promoted to president in 2004 and to chief executive and chairman in 2006 before the economic recession between 2007 and 2009. Blankfein managed Goldman Sachs for 12 years.\nToday, I dont want to retire from Goldman Sachs, but by my own perhaps convoluted logic, it feels like the right time, Blankfein said in an internal statement. Its always been hard for me to imagine leaving. When times are tougher, you cant leave. And, when times are better, you dont want to leave.\nGuy Moszkowski, analyst at financial research firm Autonomous, said Blankfein led Goldman Sachs effectively through the industry collapse of 2008 in arguably far, far better shape than most of the peer group.\nGoldman Sachs\nFounded in 1869, Goldman Sachs is an investment banking and management firm that provides financial services to corporations, financial institutions, governments and individuals.

      "Content": "Russian President Vladimir Putin delivered his annual address to the Russian Federal Assembly, made up of both houses of parliament. In the televised two-hour long speech on Thursday, Putin spent about half of the address speaking about Russias domestic development, including plans for improving the economy and education. He spent the remaining half of his speech talking about Russias security, including the development of new nuclear-armed weapons. \nPutin, 65, is running for reelection in Russias upcoming presidential election, scheduled for Mar. 18. If he wins against the seven candidates running against him, it would be his fourth six-year term. \nDomestic development\nPutin spoke about the governments plans for development, including:\n\n\treforming the national healthcare system, and setting a goal to increase life expectancy in Russia to over 80 years\n\tintroducing more affordable bank loans and housing development projects designed to increase prosperity\n\tgoals to continue to reduce poverty, saying that in the year 2000 there were 42 million people in Russia living below the poverty line, and currently there are 20 million.\n\tupgrading transport lines to become a route for trade between Europe and Asia\n\tinvesting in Russias energy grid, internet infrastructure and satellite communications, with a goal to become one of the worlds centers for storing and processing big data\n\timproving the education system, with a focus on job skills training.\n\testablishing new scientific centers with technologically-advanced equipment, and passing legislation aimed at attracting leading scientists to develop the centers.\n\treducing the number of state-owned businesses in Russias economy, including privatizing banks.\n\nSecurity and weapons development\nPutin said Russia has developed weapons in response to the U.S. withdrawal from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty in 2002 and the continued development of the U.S. anti-ballistic missile capabilities. Through his speech and with the use of video animations, Putin described the new weapons, saying Russia:\n\n\tdeveloped a new heavy intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) known as Sarmat.\n\tdeveloped a new nuclear reactor which can be mounted on a sea-launched or air-launched cruise missile. The unnamed system with a practically unlimited range can travel an unpredictable flight path, Putin said.\n\tpossesses an underwater drone with a smaller and more powerful nuclear reactor than earlier models.\n\tpossesses a hypersonic missile called Kinzhal (dagger) that can carry a nuclear warhead.\n\tdeveloped a hypersonic gliding warhead called Avangard (vanguard) that is being serially produced.\n\nU.S. response\nU.S. officials were not surprised by Putins speech, said Pentagon spokeswoman Dana White. Earlier this month, the Pentagon released its Nuclear Posture Review, a report that said Russia is developing a a hypersonic glide vehicle, and a new intercontinental, nuclear-armed, nuclear-powered, undersea autonomous torpedo.\nSources: BBC, RT, The Washington Post",

      "Content": "Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe did not announce he would resign during a televised address on Sunday, hours after the ruling party fired him as party leader and said it would impeach him if he did not step down. Mugabe delivered the speech from his residence in Harare, where hes been under house arrest since the military took control of the government on Nov. 14 and 15. He was surrounded by military generals.\nThe congress is due in a few weeks from now. I will preside over its processes, which must not be possessed by any acts calculated to undermine it or compromise the outcomes in the eyes of the public, Mugabe said.\nOn Nov. 6, Mugabe fired Vice President Emmerson Mnangagwa. Then on Wednesday, the military announced that it had taken control of the government and the state broadcaster, and had detained Mugabe and his family the previous day. During his speech, Mugabe said, Whatever the pros and cons of how [the army] went about their operation, I, as commander-in-chief, do acknowledge their concerns. He did not say the army had violated the constitution.\nEarlier on Sunday, the ruling Zanu-PF partys Central Committee met and fired Mugabe, 93, as the leader of the party. It said Mugabe had until Monday at noon local time to announce his resignation as president or be subject to impeachment proceedings. Impeaching the president requires a two-thirds majority vote in both houses of parliament, BBC reported.\nZanu-PF named Mnangagwa, the former vice president, as the new party leader and its candidate for the 2018 elections. Zanu-PF also expelled Mugabes wife Grace, 52, from the party and dismissed her as head of the women's league. She has not been seen in public since her husband was placed under house arrest.\nThere were protests calling for Mugabes resignation on Saturday in the capital. BBC reported that tens of thousands of demonstrators attended. Mugabe has led Zimbabwe for the 37 years since it gained independence from Britain in 1980. \nSources: BBC, Fox News",

Prosecutors alleged the group cooperated with human smugglers, and requested a pre-emptive seizure of the boat, the Iuventa, in August 2017 to prevent the alleged crimes from continuing.\nProsecutors said that boat was seized because crew members had contact with human smugglers on three occasions. Jugend Rettets lawyer, Philipp Kulker, said the evidence used in the decision had been fabricated. The court plans to publish an explanatory statement in the coming weeks, Al Jazeera reported.\nAccording to Al Jazeera, prosecutors have not filed official charges against any individuals allegedly involved in the Iuventa case. In Italy, aiding and abetting illegal migration can result in a five- to 15-year prison sentence, and a finebreit of 15,000 euros (about $18,300) for each person who has been let into the country. \nJugend Rettet (German for youth rescue) said Tuesday it would continue to fight for the right to rescue people in danger at sea.\nAccording to the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR), one in 14 people emigrating from Libya to Italy by boat this year have died, and one in 29 migrants died in the same period last year. Italy had 119,130 migrant arrivals in 2017, which is a decine from the previous years total of 181,436, according to Al Jazeera.\nThe Iuventa is being held in the port of Trapani in western Sicily.\nSources: Al Jazeera, AP",

      "Content": "On Monday, U.S. President Donald Trump approved tariffs on imported solar panel components and washing machines. The decision followed a recommendation from the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC).\nU.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer issued a statement saying that Injury to U.S. washing machine manufacturers stems from a sharp increase in imports that began in 2012. The ITC found that imports of large residential washers increased steadily from 2012 to 2016, and that domestic producers financial performance declined precipitously. \nAccording to the decision, an immediate tariff of 30 percent will apply to most imported solar modules, with the rate declining 5 percent each year over the next four years. Solar cell imports will be exempt from the tariff, The Associated Press (AP) reported. Regarding washing machines, a 20 percent tariff will be applied to the first 1.2 million units, and a 50 percent tariff to subsequent imports during the next two years.\nSuniva Inc. and the U.S. subsidiary of Germanys SolarWorld reportedly sought the tariffs on solar panels after they claimed imported components over five years led to a decrease in prices.\nSolar installers opposed the decision, saying it would raise prices and lower demand. The Solar Energy Industries Association said the decision will lead to billions of dollars of solar investment [being] delayed or canceled, leading to the loss of 23,000 jobs this year presumably in the U.S., AP reported.\nWhirlpool Corp. supported the tariffs on washing machines, saying they would create manufacturing jobs in the U.S.\nA 1974 trade law allows U.S. companies to seek trade protections if they can prove damages from a rise in imports. Countries affected by the decision may appeal to the World Trade Organization, according to AP.\nSources: AP, NPR",

Trump said, Were going to build our steel industry back and our aluminum industry back. White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders did not provide more details and said the tariffs were being finalized. \nThe U.S. produced 86.5 million tons of steel in 2016, it imports more than four times the amount it exports, and sources its imports from 110 countries and territories, according to BBC. \nCanada buys over 50 percent of exported U.S. steel and is the largest supplier of steel imports to the U.S., providing 16 percent, according to Reuters. Brazil and South Korea sell the second and third largest amounts to the U.S. China is the eleventh largest supplier of steel to the U.S., providing two percent, according to BBC. \nInternational response\nCanadas Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland said any tariffs would be absolutely unacceptable and if implemented, Canada would take responsive measures to defend its trade interests and workers.\nEuropean Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said the EU would react firmly and commensurately to defend our interests. The EU has reportedly drafted a plan to tax $3.5 billion of U.S. imports, including bourbon, blue jeans, orange juice and motorcycles, should the U.S. impose tariffs next week. The EU estimates the U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum would cost the bloc $3.5 billion. About 15 percent of the EUs 2017 steel exports went to the U.S., according to European steel association Eurofer. \nEarlier this month, Wang Hejun, chief of the Trade Remedy and Investigation Bureau at Chinas Ministry of Commerce, said if the final decision on steel tariffs impacts Chinas interests, China will certainly take necessary measures to protect its own rights.\nTrumps tweets after the international response\nOn Saturday, Trump tweeted, If the E.U. wants to further increase their already massive tariffs and barriers on U.S. companies doing business there, we will simply apply a Tax on their Cars which freely pour into the U.S. They make it impossible for our cars (and more) to sell there. Big trade imbalance!\nThe E.U. currently imposes a 10 percent tariff on U.S. passenger car imports. The U.S. imposes a 2.5 percent tariff on passenger car imports from the EU. In 2016, Europe exported 37.7 billion (then $40.1 billion) worth of passenger cars to the U.S., according to the European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA).\nNote: This Raw Data was updated on March 4 to reflect the European Commissions and Trumps statements.\nSources: BBC 1, BBC 2, Bloomberg, Reuters 1, Reuters 2, The New York Times, The Washington Post",

The cabin lost pressure and a woman was sucked out of the plane to her waist. Though people on board pulled her back in by her legs, she was later pronounced dead. Seven other passengers were treated for minor injuries, Philadelphia fire officials said. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is investigating the incident.\nDetails of the incident\nSouthwest flight 1380 was headed from New Yorks LaGuardia Airport to Dallas, with 144 passengers and five crew onboard. The planes left engine made a noise that passengers described as sounding like an explosion, about 20 minutes after takeoff. A window behind the left wing broke, and photographs of the plane after it landed showed it was missing.\nAfter the window broke, the cabin lost pressure and oxygen masks dropped from the aircrafts ceiling. Passenger Jennifer Riordan of Albuquerque, New Mexico, was sucked out the window up to her waist; her head and arms were out of the plane. Some men on the plane pulled her back in and two passengers performed CPR on her for 20 minutes. She was later pronounced dead. Riordan was a vice president of community relations for Wells Fargo  it can lead to the creation of small cracks. Sumwalt said the information was preliminary.\nSumwalt also said a covering for the engine was found in Bernville, Pennsylvania, about 70 miles west of Philadelphia. The engine was a CFM56-7B, which, according to NBC Philadelphia, is designed to prevent any debris that may accidentally break off from traveling into the planes body. The jet engine supplier CFM issued a service bulletin last fall for airlines to inspect the fan blades of this engine after a similar incident occurred on another Southwest flight, NBC Philadelphia reported. Officials had checked the planes engines on Sunday. \nCompany responses \nSouthwest Airlines CEO Gary Kelly said, I am immensely grateful there are no other reports of injuries but truly this is a tragic loss. He thanked the crew for its actions. Kelly told the NTSB that the company would start additional inspections of its planes engines, including through the use of ultrasound to detect possible fatigue, according to Sumwalt. \nRiordans death was the first onboard a Southwest flight in the companys 51 year history. The death was the first on a U.S. passenger airline in more than nine years, according to Bloomberg.\nCFM International, Inc. is a joint venture between General Electric Co. and French company Safran SA. CFM engines are used on more than 6,700 aircraft and have more than 350 million flight hours on them, according to CFM. The company said the engine has an outstanding safety and reliability record since it first came out in 1997.\nSources: AP, Bloomberg, CNN, NBC Philadelphia",

      "Content": "The director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Dr. Brenda Fitzgerald, resigned on Wednesday. After assuming the role in July, she was recused from working on certain issues due to conflicts of interest with stocks she held. She reportedly still holds some of them. On Tuesday, Politico reported that Fitzgerald had bought tobacco stock in August. Following Fitzgeralds resignation, CDCs principal deputy director, Anne Schuchat, became acting director. \nA statement from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), which oversees the CDC, said, Dr. Fitzgerald owns certain complex financial interests that have imposed a broad recusal limiting her ability to complete all of her duties as the CDC Director. Due to the nature of these financial interests, Dr. Fitzgerald could not divest from them in a definitive time period. After advising [HHS Secretary Alex Azar] of both the status of the financial interests and the scope of her recusal, Dr. Fitzgerald tendered, and the Secretary accepted, her resignation. The Secretary thanks Dr. Brenda Fitzgerald for her service and wishes her the best in all her endeavors.\" \nAfter she became CDC head, Fitzgeralds financial manager reportedly bought stocks for her that presented conflict of interest issues. On Aug. 8, Fitzgerald bought between $1,001 and $15,000 in stock in Japan Tobacco, which owns four brands of cigarettes sold in the United States. After July, she also bought stock in two pharmaceutical companies, Merck  Co. and Bayer, and a health insurance company, Humana. \nFitzgerald reportedly sold the tobacco stock in October. By November, she had reportedly sold the rest of the aforementioned stocks, at least those above the $1,000 value limit that must be reported due to the Stock Act.\nFitzgerald hasnt attended some meetings due to her recusals. Sen. Patricia Murray (D-Wash.) said that Fitzgerald had deputies testify at Congressional hearings on opioid use on at least three occasions. \nFormer HHS Secretary Tom Price appointed Fitzgerald as CDC director. Fitzgerald is an obstetrician and gynecologist from Georgia.\nSources: CNN, Politico",

      "Content": "President Donald Trump announced that he and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker had agreed to work together towards zero tariffs, zero nontariff barriers and zero subsidies on non-auto industrial goods, following a meeting of the two leaders. Juncker said he and Trump agreed that while trade negotiations were ongoing, they would hold off further tariffs and reassess existing tariffs on steel and aluminum, which the U.S. imposed on EU imports last month. \nTrump has said in recent months that he would consider imposing 20 to 25 percent tariffs on automobiles from the EU. \nAfter the presidents meeting in the Oval Office, Trump said relations between the U.S. and the EU had entered a new phase of close friendship and strong trade relations in which both of us will win. He added that relations would involve working better together for global security and prosperity and fighting jointly against terrorism.\nTrump also said the U.S. and EU would work together to reform the World Trade Organization (WTO), which deals with trade rules and agreements among member states. He also announced that the EU would import more U.S. soybeans and liquefied natural gas (LNG). \nJuncker said, As far as agriculture is concerned, the European Union can import more soybeans from the U.S., and it will be done. He added, The EU will build more terminals to import liquefied natural gas from the U.S.\nTrade relations \nTrump said the U.S. and EU have a $1 trillion trade relationship and together account for 50 percent of the worlds gross domestic product (GDP). He said the two sides agreed to start a close dialogue on standards, in order to ease trade, reduce bureaucratic obstacles, and slash costs dramatically.\nJuncker said, We have identified a number of areas on which to work together, work towards zero tariffs on industrial goods, adding that was his main intention.\nTrump said it was a very big day for free and fair trade and said the two sides would resolve the steel and aluminum tariff issues and we will resolve retaliatory tariffs. \nWe have some tariffs that are retaliatory and that will get resolved as part of what were doing, Trump said. Were starting the negotiation right now, but we know very much where its going.\nThe Trump administration implemented steel and aluminum tariffs on imports from some countries in March, giving the EU and select other countries a temporary exemption. The U.S. allowed the EUs exemption to expire on June 1. \nOn June 22, the EU imposed retaliatory tariffs on $3.4 billion (2.9 billion euros) of American imports including steel products, agricultural products, alcoholic beverages and cigarettes.\nOn July 17, the White House announced the scheduled meeting between Trump and Juncker, saying that they would discuss a wide range of priorities, including foreign and security policy, counterterrorism, energy security, and economic growth, and focus on improving transatlantic trade and forging a stronger economic partnership.\nPossible automotive tariffs\nIn March, Trump said during a press conference with the Swedish prime minister that the EU has been tough on the U.S., yet they send their cars and everything else back to the U.S. We can put a tax of 25 percent on their cars and believe me they won't be doing It for very long. Last month, he tweeted that the U.S. would be placing a 20% Tariff on all of their cars coming into the U.S., if the trade tariffs and barriers were not removed soon.\nThis week, media sources, including Politico and The Washington Post, reported that Trump was considering imposing 25 percent tariffs on imported automobiles. The EU said it is preparing a list of $20 billion worth of U.S. goods on which it could apply retaliatory tariffs if the U.S. implemented the proposed automobile tariffs.\nThe EU currently has a 10 percent tariff on imports of U.S. automobiles, the Post reported, while the U.S. has a 2.5 percent tariff on European car imports and 25 percent on light truck and sport-utility vehicle imports. The U.S. imported $192 billion in new passenger vehicles in 2017, the Post reported. \nThe Trump administration could also impose tariffs on imports of automobile parts, which together with cars and trucks made up about $335 billion in imports last year, according to The Associated Press. The Commerce Department may announce, in September, the results of its national security-based investigation, begun on May 23, into automobile-related imports, with recommendations for Trump on possible tariffs or other measures.\nSources: AP, CNBC, Deutsche Welle, Fox News, Reuters, Politico, The New York Times, The Washington Post, The White House, Trump Twitter, USA Today",

      "Content": "The International Organization for Migration (IOM) selected Portuguese politician Antnio Vitorino as its director general on Friday, after U.S. candidate Ken Isaacs was eliminated during voting. \nIsaacs was eliminated after three rounds of voting, according to AFP. The current deputy director general, Laura Thompson from Costa Rica, then removed herself from the running and Vitorino won by acclamation, AFP reported. The ballots were secret, NBC News reported. \nVitorino is scheduled to take over from the current director, U.S. diplomat William Lacy Swing, on Oct. 1, according to an IOM statement. Vitorino will be the second non-American head of the agency since it was founded in 1951.\nVitorinos career\nIn the 1990s, Vitorino served as Portugal's deputy prime minister and defense minister, working under Antnio Guterres, the current U.N. secretary general. Vitorino resigned from the Portuguese parliament in 1997, following media reports that raised questions about whether he had paid his property taxes in full. He then served as the European justice commissioner between 1999 and 2004.\nMigration is a \"triple win for countries of origin, for countries of destination but above all for the migrants themselves, Vitorino said at an event earlier this month. He said theres a need to build a broad consensus in the international area about the advantages of migration, adding that organizations like the IOM can aid in that. \nContext of Isaacs vote\nIsaacs, a vice president of a Christian humanitarian aid Samaritan's Purse, was nominated by President Donald Trump to the IOM position in February. After his nomination, news media reported on some of Isaacs' social media posts that were critical of Islam, such as him saying, Islam is not peaceful after a 2016 attack in the French city of Nice for which Islamic State claimed responsibility. Isaacs made his Twitter account private after the media coverage; he did not deny making the comments. \nThe Trump administration has recently criticized other U.N. bodies, and the U.S. withdrew from the U.N. Human Rights Council earlier this month, citing an alleged anti-Israel bias. Also earlier this month, the U.N. Human Rights Commissioner, Zeid Raad Al Hussein, criticized the Trump administrations policy of separating immigrant families, calling it unconscionable, before Trump announced a change in the policy. \nIsaacs did not respond to NBC News request for comment about the IOM vote. \nThe IOM\nThe IOM is dedicated to promoting humane and orderly migration for the benefit of all, by providing services and advice to governments and migrants. It also works to promote international cooperation on migration issues, to assist in the search for practical solutions to migration problems and to provide humanitarian assistance to migrants, according to its website. The Geneva-based organization has 169 member states, plus eight nations with observer status, and field offices in more than 100 countries.\nThe IOM was headed by an American from 1951 to 1961, and then again from 1969 until now. In 2016, it became affiliated with the United Nations. \n\nSources: AFP, BBC, IOM, NBC News",

      "Content": "On Wednesday, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) voted to reject Russias request for a joint investigation with the U.K. into the March 4 poisoning of former Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury, England. The vote was 15-6, with 17 abstentions and three absences or countries ineligible to vote. Countries that voted to grant the request included Algeria, Azerbaijan, China, Iran and Sudan, Reuters reported.\nOn Tuesday, the U.K.s Porton Down laboratory, which identified the poison as military grade Novichok, said it could not verify the source of the nerve agent. The Soviet Union developed Novichok and other nerve agents in the 1970s and 1980s. Porton Down said the substance likely came from a state actor. \nJohn Foggo, acting British envoy to the OPCW, said the U.K. concluded Russia was responsible for the attack based on: the nerve agent used, Russias capability of producing it, its record of assassinating defectors, and that it had given 24 contradictory and changing counter-narratives about the poisoning. Foggo added that Russia suggesting the attack may have been sponsored by the U.S., the U.K. or Sweden was preposterous.\nOPCW Russian representative Aleksander Shulgin said his country had nothing to do with the poisoning and that it had the appearance of a terrorist attack. He had earlier said Russia would reject the results of the OPCW investigation if it was not allowed to participate in the testing of Salisbury samples. The OPCW, which oversees the 1997 Chemical Weapons Convention, expects results from those tests next week.\nRussian U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said Russia has called for a meeting of the U.N. Security Council on Thursday to discuss Britains accusations against Russia.\nSergei Skripal remains in critical condition in a U.K. hospital. His daughter, a Russian citizen, has shown improvement and is no longer in critical condition. The two were found unconscious on a park bench after the attack. \nAfter British Prime Minister Theresa May said Russia was highly likely responsible for the attack, more than 20 countries expelled a total of 150 Russian diplomats. Russia responded in kind, saying it would expel a total of 150 diplomats from those countries.\nSources: BBC, Reuters",

The Metropolitan Police said, whilst we believe we know the identity of the deceased, formal identification is yet to take place. According to police, a man in his 60s died and the cause of death was compression to the neck. \nAs a precaution because of associations that the man is believed to have had, the Metropolitan polices counterterrorism unit is in charge of the investigation. \nGlushkov had worked with the late Russian oligarch Boris Berezovsky, as a director of Berezovskys LogoVAZ car company in the 1990s. Berezovsky was a supporter of Vladimir Putin, then later became critical of Putin and left Russia and entered self-imposed exile in the U.K., NPR reported. Berezovsky was found dead in London in 2013. Police ruled his death a suicide. \nGlushkov was also formerly a director of Russian state airline Aeroflot. In 1999, he was charged with money laundering and fraud and went to prison for five years. After he was released, he left Russia and was granted political asylum in the U.K. \nIn 2017, he was tried in absentia in Russia for stealing $123 million from Aeroflot and sentenced to eight years in prison. The airline pursued the case in London and Glushkov was due to attend a hearing on Monday at 10:30 a.m. He did not attend the hearing. \nTwo weeks prior to Glushkovs reported death, two other Russians, Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia, were poisoned in an attempted murder in Salisbury on March 4. About that case, the police said, at this stage there is nothing to suggest any link to the attempted murders in Salisbury, nor any evidence that [the deceased] was poisoned.\nSources: The Guardian, NPR, RT",

      "Content": "Filibusters, cloture votes, the nuclear option; people reading about the latest budget bill in the U.S. Senate may have come across these terms and wondered what they mean. In general, theyre specific to how the Senate votes on a bill. We break down each term and process below.\nFirst lets start with a bill itself:\nHow a bill becomes law in the Senate\n\n\tA bill is drafted (it can be drafted by lawmakers, scholars, the White House or even constituents).\n\tIf it goes to the Senate first (as opposed to the House of Representatives), a senator introduces it in the Senate chamber.\n\tIf no senators object, the bill is read twice and referred to a particular committee, such as the appropriations committee, for review.\n\tThe bill is entered into the Senate journal and given a number.\n\tOnce entered into the legislative system, it is printed for Senate, House and committee members.\n\tThe bill is then placed on the legislative calendar.\n\tThe Senate majority leader requests unanimous consent to present the bill before the Senate.\n\tIf consent is granted, the senators debate the bill; they may also submit or propose amendments.\n\tAfter a third reading of the bill, it is brought to the Senate chamber for a vote.\n\tIf the bill passes there, a final copy is prepared and delivered to the House of Representatives for a vote.\n\tThe House may vote on the bill as is or amend it. If it is amended and passes, it must return to the Senate for another vote.\n\tIf passed in the House as is, the bill is sent to the White House for the presidents signature.\n\tOnce the president signs a bill that both chambers approved, it becomes law.\n\nVoting in the Senate\nA bill typically requires a simple majority to pass, though senators may seek 60 votes to avoid a filibuster (explained in the next section). In the case of a tie, the vice president casts the tie breaking vote.\nThere are three methods of voting used in the Senate: roll-call, voice or division.\n\nRoll call vote: Each senator votes \"Yes\" or \"No\" (or yea and nay) as the chamber clerk calls his or her name, and records the votes on a tally sheet. A roll call vote must be taken if requested by at least one-fifth of senators (20).\nVoice vote: The presiding officer in the Senate states the question or motion, and then asks for those in favor to say yea and those against to say no. The officer uses his or her best judgement to determine the ruling and then announces the results. In a voice vote, senators names and the exact number of votes are not recorded.\nDivision vote: If a senator disagrees with the presiding officers best judgement when declaring a voice vote, he or she may request that the presiding officer count the yeas and nos to confirm the voice vote.\n\nThe filibuster\nAccording to the U.S. Senate, the term filibuster comes from a Dutch word meaning pirate. Senators usually have the right to speak on the Senate floor for as long as he or she wants, as long as no other senator is speaking. Filibustering is when a senator prevents voting on a bill by holding the Senate floor and continuing to speak. Filibustering is not allowed during House votes.\nIn 1917, the Senate adopted a rule that allowed it to end a filibuster with a two-thirds majority of 67 votes, also called a cloture vote. In 1975, the Senate lowered the number needed for a cloture vote to 60. For example, if the Senate majority leader wanted a bill to pass, and he or she knew that senators who opposed the bill planned to filibuster, the majority leader may seek 60 senators to vote to end the debate process, which ends a filibuster. (For Hollywoods take on the filibuster, watch Jimmy Stewarts Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.)\nReconciliation\nThe Senate can bypass a filibuster and vote via a simple majority (51 votes) if the bill meets reconciliation rules created by the Congressional Budget Act. Reconciliation pertains to legislation that affects mandatory spending programs or taxes. It was recently used to pass the tax bill.\nThe nuclear option\nThe nuclear option is a term supposedly coined by The Washington Times after an interview with former Republican Sen. Trent Lott. It refers to the process of changing Senate rules and eliminating the filibuster so that legislation can pass with a simple majority. \nThe Senate has used the nuclear option, or changed rules, to confirm nominees to judicial posts. In 2013, then-Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer changed Senate confirmation rules for posts in lower courts to help confirm President Obamas judicial nominees. Last year, current Majority Leader Mitch McConnell changed Senate confirmation rules for the U.S. Supreme Court to confirm Neil Gorsuch.\nOnce the Senate rules are changed, theyre changed; it sets a precedent for the required number of votes on a topic. Changing the rules for legislative votes can limit the minority partys ability to object to bills, so a majority party may not want to change the rules because it would set a precedent that might affect the party when its a minority in the future, according to USA Today. According to Politifact, the nuclear option has not been used to change legislative voting rules.",

      "Content": "New York, Connecticut, Maryland and New Jersey filed a lawsuit Tuesday against the federal government over the 2017 tax reform law, which limits federal deductions for state and local taxes. The lawsuit claims the deduction cap would cause significant and disproportionate injury to the plaintiff states and their residents. The Treasury Department said it is reviewing the complaint. \nThe 2017 law limited the amount that taxpayers could deduct for state and local taxes, called SALT. Prior to the law, SALT deductions had no limit. The deduction is now limited to $10,000 for federal returns, regardless of the state. Deductions help reduce the amount of taxes owed to the government.\nThe lawsuit claims New York taxpayers could pay an additional $14.3 billion in taxes for 2018 and up to $121 billion through 2025. The lawsuit noted that other plaintiff states will experience similar effects as a result of the maximum. In New York, residents claimed an average of $22,169 in SALT deductions in 2015, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center.\nAccording to figures from the non-profit Tax Foundation, New York, Connecticut and New Jersey hold the top three spots for the most expensive state and local tax burdens per capita as a percentage of income, using 2012 figures. Maryland is the seventh most expensive by that measure, according to the figures. The four states are within the top nine for most state and local taxes collected per capita (not as a percentage of income) in 2015, according to the Tax Foundation. \nAverage SALT deduction claims on federal taxes exceeded $10,000 in 19 states plus D.C., according to Pew Trust figures for 2015. New York, New Jersey and Connecticut were three of the top four states for per-claimant averages, with Maryland in the eighth spot, Pew reported. \nNew York State Attorney General Barbara Underwood said the tax law deliberately targeted her state and similar states in order to coerce them into changing our fiscal policies and the vital programs they support.\nThe lawsuit claims the deduction limit could decrease home values by increasing the cost of owning a home, and thereby affect homeowners equity. Increased federal taxes could limit spending on goods and services, which in turn could lead to decreased business sales, the lawsuit claims. The SALT limit could also reduce state revenue used to pay for services such as schools, hospitals, police, road and bridge construction and maintenance, the lawsuit claims. It argues the limit would interfere with the states sovereign authority.\nThe lawsuit challenges the legality of the federal tax legislation on three constitutional grounds, claiming the SALT limit violates: the Tenth Amendment (states rights), the Sixteenth Amendment (federal power to tax incomes), and Article I, Section 8 (Congress power to tax). \nThe lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. Defendants include the Treasury Department, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and the Internal Revenue Service.\nSources: CNN, Reuters, New York et al v Mnuchin et al, Pew Trust, Tax Foundation, Tax Foundation",

      "Content": "On Thursday, Australias parliament passed laws against foreign interference in elections and domestic affairs, as well as against espionage. The new laws require foreign government lobbyists to register with the Australian government. The laws also make stealing trade secrets on behalf of a foreign government a criminal offense and they impose new, larger penalties on those who disclose classified government information. The laws add 38 new crimes, with punishments ranging from 10 to 20 years in prison, according to The New York Times.\nUnder the laws, journalists can use a legal defense of reporting in the public interest if they are found to possess or publish classified information.\nThe laws make it illegal for people to act covertly on behalf of a foreign government to influence Australian elections, such as by organizing rallies. The laws also make it a crime to assist foreign spies in Australia and to damage economic relations with other countries. Damaging critical infrastructure, which includes cyberattacks on networks such as energy grids and transport systems, is also a crime under the new laws, SBS News reported. \nIn December, Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said, Foreign powers are making unprecedented and increasingly sophisticated attempts to influence the political process, both here and abroad. He added, Media reports have suggested that the Chinese Communist Party has been working to covertly interfere with our media, our universities and even the decisions of elected representatives right here in this building. We take these reports very seriously.\nLu Kang, spokesman for Chinas Foreign Ministry, said the country does not interfere in other countries affairs, the Times reported. Kang said, We hope that all countries could cast off [a] Cold War mind-set and strengthen exchanges and cooperation on the basis of mutual respect and equal treatment.\nThe new laws allow the attorney general to name individuals as foreign agents without due process, according to the Times.\nGreens party Senator Nick McKim said, We will strongly oppose this legislation because of its impacts on freedom of speech, public interest journalism and non-violent protest.\nAustralian Attorney General Christian Porter said, The practices of modern espionage are now being encountered in so many Western democracies around the globe. He added, To counter this threat, Australia must have a robust, modern legislative framework to ensure our law enforcement and national security agencies are sufficiently empowered to investigate and disrupt malicious foreign interference.\nThe government is planning future legislation to ban foreign political donations. \nSources: BBC, Reuters, SBS News, The New York Times",

      "Content": "Michael Cohen pleaded guilty on Tuesday to eight criminal counts related to tax evasion and violation of campaign finance laws. Cohen, a 51-year-old former personal attorney for President Donald Trump, was released on a $500,000 bail to await sentencing. \nThe plea agreement, approved by the Justice Department's Tax Division and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), called for a Cohen to receive a prison sentence of between roughly three and a half and five years in prison. Without the plea agreement, the maximum sentence for the eight counts would have been 65 years in prison, according to court documents. \nThe eight counts Cohen pleaded guilty to are: \n\n\tFive counts of tax evasion for the years 2012 through 2016;\n\tOne count of making false statements to a financial institution in connection with a credit decision (to receive a $500,000 loan, according to prosecutors);\n\tOne count of willfully causing an unlawful corporate contribution (in reference to a campaign contribution), and;\n\tOne count of making an excessive campaign contribution.\n\nIn court on Tuesday, without mentioning Trump or others by name, Cohen told the judge about two 2016 payments made while working for an unnamed candidate, in reference to the illegal campaign contribution charges in the guilty plea. In response to a question from the judge, he said one payment was made in coordination and at the direction of a candidate for federal office, and the other was made under direction of the same candidate. \nI participated in this conduct, which on my part took place in Manhattan, for the principal purpose of influencing the election, Cohen told the judge. \nCohen reportedly made a $130,000 payment to former adult film actress Stephanie Clifford, stage name Stormy Daniels, and a $150,000 payment to American Media Inc. (AMI), the National Enquirers parent company, which bought the rights to a story from former Playboy model Karen McDougal, and then never ran it. Both women claim to have had sexual affairs with Trump in 2006, and Trump denies both claims. (Read more about that here.) \nTrump had previously denied knowledge of Cohens payments to Clifford and indirectly to McDougal. Legal opinions differ on whether Trump could be charged for campaign finance-related crimes while in office. The Justice Departments Office of Legal Counsel holds that a president cannot be indicted while in office.\nThe case against Cohen developed from evidence referred to federal prosecutors in New York by Special Counsel Robert Muellers team, which is investigating alleged Russian election interference and possible coordination between Russia and members of Trumps campaign. In April, the FBI raided Cohens home, hotel room and office and seized more than four million documents, including information related to the payments to Clifford and McDougal.\nAs part of Cohens plea agreement, he agreed to: pay back taxes as determined by the IRS, currently estimated to be almost $1.5 million; forfeit any property received as a result of making false statements to the financial institution; potentially pay a fine between $20,000 and $1 million; and like serve between 43 and 63 months in prison, in accordance with a Stipulated Guideline Range. \nCohen is scheduled to be sentenced by the court on Dec. 12. Although the court will not be legally bound by the Stipulated Guideline Range, both the defense and the prosecution agreed to that range and both parties agreed not to appeal if a sentence falls within those guidelines. \n\nSources: AP, Cohen guilty plea, The New York Times",

CMS sent a letter to state Medicaid directors saying that the new policy is designed to assist states in their efforts to improve Medicaid enrollee health and well-being through incentivizing work and community engagement.\nCurrently, Medicaid recipients are not required to work or be employed to receive benefits. In order to waive provisions of federal Medicaid programs, states must submit proposals for experimental, pilot, or demonstration projects and have them approved by CMS. \nCMS said that it would support state demonstration projects that require at least 20 hours per week of work, skills training, education, job search, volunteering or caregiving for Medicaid recipients who were able-bodied, working-age adults. These requirements would not apply to elderly Medicaid recipients, children, pregnant women, or those whose benefits were due to a disability. \nCMS Administrator Seema Verma said 10 states have submitted demonstration project proposals: Arizona, Arkansas, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Utah and Wisconsin. According to Politico, Mississippi has also submitted a proposal.\nSome Democrats and advocacy groups have said they would sue to block any new work requirement plans that CMS approves, Politico reported.\nMedicaid recipients\nThere are more than 70 million Medicaid recipients. Some states received federal waivers to test new ideas on how to administer the program.\nA study by the non-partisan Kaiser Family Foundation determined that about 60 percent of working-age Medicaid recipients are currently employed either full- or part-time. Some of the working recipients employers do not offer health insurance. According to the study, the majority who were not working said they were ill, caring for a family member, or attending a school.\nThe Medicaid program was started 52 years ago. In 2014, the Affordable Care Act allowed states to extend Medicaid coverage to people who lived up to 38 percent above the federal poverty line. Thirty-one states extended coverage in this way.\nSources: CMS, Fox News, Politico",

      "Content": "The Office of the Inspector General (OIG) of the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) released a 500-page report on Thursday that reviewed various actions by the FBI and the DOJ ahead of the 2016 presidential election. Regarding the investigation of then-presidential candidate Hillary Clintons use of a private email server while Secretary of State, the OIG found no evidence that the conclusions by department prosecutors were affected by bias or other improper considerations. The report also examined text messages sent by FBI employees, including FBI Deputy Assistant Director Peter Strzok, and found his conduct and that of four other employees impacted the reputation of the FBI.\nThe report concluded that in the Clinton email investigation, and a separate investigation of possibly politically-motivated donations to the Clinton Foundation, there was some poor judgement and insubordination by certain FBI and DOJ leaders, including former FBI Director James Comey.\nInspector General Michael E. Horowitz office said it reviewed information regarding six topics involved with the DOJs and FBIs 2016 investigations into Clinton Foundation donations and Clintons emails. The topics and the reports conclusions were:\n\n\tWhether FBI policies and procedures were followed in connection with then-FBI Director Comeys public announcement about the investigation on July 5, 2016, and his letters to Congress on Oct. 28 and Nov. 6, 2016: The report concluded Comey was insubordinate in not telling the DOJ until the morning of his July 5, 2016 press conference that he would make a public statement on the status of the Clinton email investigation. The report said Comey told the OIG this was intentional because he was concerned the DOJ would instruct him not to give the press conference. At the event, Comey said Clinton and her aides were extremely careless in their handling of classified information, and that the FBI recommended the DOJ not prosecute Clinton. The OIG said the decision not to prosecute was consistent.\n\tWhether decisions in the FBI were based on proper considerations: The report found there was no evidence that the conclusions by department prosecutors were affected by bias or other improper considerations. The OIG said it found they were based on the prosecutors assessment of facts, the law, and past department practice.\n\tWhether then-FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe should have recused himself from certain investigative matters: The report concluded McCabe did not fully comply with his recusal in a few instances related to the Clinton Foundation investigation. The report also said the FBIs ethics officials and attorneys did not fully appreciate the potential significant implications campaign contributions had to McCabe and the FBI. The contributions were from entities associated with former Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe, a Clinton supporter, to McCabes wifes Democratic campaign for the Virginia state senate. Michael Bromwich, an attorney for McCabe, said any and all claims that political bias or political influence affected McCabes actions are entirely baseless.\n\tWhether then-Assistant Attorney General for Legislative Affairs Peter Kadzik should have recused himself from certain matters, and whether he properly disclosed information to the public: The report said Kadzik demonstrated poor judgement in failing to recuse himself from Clinton-related matters under federal ethics regulations prior to Nov. 2, 2016. The report said Kadzik created an appearance of a conflict when he sent the Chairman of the Clinton Campaign and a longtime friend, John Podesta, the Heads up email [in May 2015] that included the schedule for the release of former Secretary Clintons emails proposed to the court in a FOIA litigation without knowing whether the information had yet been filed and made public. The information had already been made public.\n\tWhether FBI and DOJ employees properly disclosed information: The report concluded the FBI policy which strictly limits the employees who are authorized to speak to the media appeared to be widely ignored during the OIGs review period prior to the 2016 election.\n\tWhether decisions on the timing and method of the FBIs release of documents on Oct. 30 and Nov. 1, 2016 were influenced by proper considerations: The report found that Comey made a serious error in judgement in sending a letter to Congress on Oct. 28, 2016, saying the FBI had reopened the Clinton investigation.\n\nPresident Donald Trump fired Comey as FBI director last May after Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and Attorney General Jeff Sessions wrote letters recommending Comeys dismissal. Rosenstein wrote, I cannot defend the directors handling of the conclusion of the investigation of Secretary Clintons emails. \nSessions fired McCabe from the FBI in March based on a DOJ report alleging he made an unauthorized disclosure to the media and lacked candor with investigators about the Clinton Foundation investigation. In April, the OIG sent a criminal referral regarding McCabe to the U.S. attorneys office in Washington. McCabe has denied the allegations.\nTexts by FBI agents\nThe report also contained text messages between Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, two FBI officials who were involved in the investigation into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, as well as the investigation of Hillary Clintons emails. Page has since resigned and the FBI reassigned Strzok. The report included a text from Page to Strzok in August 2016 saying: [Trumps] not ever going to become president, right? Right?! Strzok replied, No. No he wont. Well stop it.\nStrzok said his message was intended to reassure Page that Trump would not be elected, not to suggest that he would do something to impact the investigation, according to the report. Strzok told the OIG that he did not take any steps in either the Clinton email investigation or the Russia investigation to affect the outcome of the presidential election.\nThe OIG said the text messages potentially indicated or created the appearance that investigative decisions were impacted by bias or improper considerations. It also said, Our review did not find documentary or testimonial evidence directly connecting the political views these employees expressed in their text messages and instant messages to the specific investigative decisions we reviewed.\nBased on the text messages, the report said the OIG did not have confidence that one of Strzoks decisions to prioritize the Russia investigation over the Clinton email investigation was free from bias.\nAn attorney for Strzok, Aitan Goelman, said the OIGs report was critically flawed in its bizarre conclusion that the IG cannot rule out with confidence the possibility that Strzoks political bias may have been a cause of a delay in obtaining a warrant to investigate emails on the laptop of Anthony Weiner, then-husband to a Clinton aide. Goelman added that all facts contained in the report lead to the conclusion that the delay was caused by a variety of factors and miscommunications that had nothing to do with Strzoks political views. \nGoelman also said Strzoks dedication to unbiased service is a fact that would be universally echoed by the thousands of people who have worked with Pete during his 26 years of service in the FBI and U.S. Army.\nThe report said the OIG was referring information on text messages sent by five employees to the FBI for consideration of whether they violated the agencys Offense Code of Conduct.\nThe report included nine recommendations based on the investigation, among them: \n\n\thaving ethics officials consider reviewing campaign donations when DOJ employees or their spouses run for public office; \n\thaving the FBI consider training, guidance and warning banners on its mobile phones for employees on the proper use of text messages; \n\tmaking explicit the policy that an investigating agency consult with the Attorney Generals office prior to publicly announcing its recommended charging decisions; and \n\tconsidering adopting a policy addressing the appropriateness of DOJ employees discussing the conduct of uncharged individuals in public statements.\n\nThe report said the Clinton email investigation was one of thousands of investigations that are handled each year by the FBI, with its approximately 35,000 agents, analysts and related professionals. \nThe OIGs report came after an 18-month review with more than 100 witnesses and more than 1.2 million documents.\nResponses to the report\nThe FBI said it appreciates the thoroughness of the OIGs investigation, and the OIGs finding that there was no evidence that bias or improper considerations affected the FBIs investigative actions or decisions. The FBI also said it is reviewing the recommendations of the OIG and will be taking action.\nSessions said the report reveals a number of significant errors by the senior leadership of the Department of Justice and the FBI during the previous administration.\nPress Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the report \"reaffirmed the president's suspicions about Comey's conduct and the political bias amongst some of the members of the FBI.\" \nOn Thursday afternoon, Comey tweeted, I respect the DOJ [O]IG office, which is why I urged them to do this review. The conclusions are reasonable, even though I disagree with some. People of good faith can see an unprecedented situation differently. I pray no Director faces it again. Thanks to [O]IGs people for hard work.\nComey also authored an editorial for The New York Times in which he elaborated on what he wrote in his tweet.\nSources: AP, Fox News, National Review, The New York Times 1, The New York Times 2",

      "Content": "The U.S. House and Senate passed a spending bill on Thursday that would extend government funding until Dec. 22, 2017. The bill passed in the House 235-193, and in the Senate 81-14. U.S. President Donald Trump said he would sign the bill, which will avoid a partial government shutdown that was scheduled to go into effect at 12:01 a.m. Saturday if a spending bill was not passed. \nHouse and Senate leaders from both parties met with the president at the White House on Thursday to discuss next years budget. In the Senate, a budget bill must pass by 60 votes. Republicans hold 52 of the 100 seats, so passing the budget will require some Democratic votes. \nDemocratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (N.Y.) and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (Calif.) said that some of the Democrats priorities for next years budget were healthcare, immigration issues including an agreement on Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), funding for veterans and programs to prevent opioid abuse. \nSpokesmen for House Speaker Paul Ryan (Wis.) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) said Republican budget priorities included border security, immigration enforcement and defense spending. House Freedom Caucus chairman Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) said there would be zero support for a spending budget that is too high.\nOn Wednesday, Trump had said a government shutdown could happen due to immigration issues. Pelosi said, Democrats are not willing to shut government down. \nSources: The Associated Press, The Washington Post",

ANCs Secretary General Ace Magashule said Zuma had agreed to step down if he could oversee a transition period of three to six months. The ANC leadership did not accept Zumas request. If he doesnt resign, a vote of no confidence has been scheduled in parliament for Feb. 22, which could lead to Zumas removal from office.\nSouth Africas parliament has previously held votes of no confidence in Zuma. The two most recent ones were held in 2016 and 2017, but did not pass.\nZuma, 75, became president in 2009. In 2016, South Africas Constitutional Court ruled that Zuma had violated the constitution by failing to repay government money he spent on renovating his private home. In 2017, the Supreme Court of Appeal ruled that 18 counts of corruption, fraud, racketeering and money laundering related to a 1999 arms deal should be reinstated. The charges had previously been dropped. Zuma has denied all allegations of corruption.\nIn December of last year, Cyril Ramaphosa replaced Zuma as leader of the ANC. Zumas presidential term expires next year. Only parliament can remove him from office before then.\nSources: BBC, CNN, Deutsche Welle",

      "Content": "On Sunday, Chiang Rai acting Gov. Narongsak Osatanakorn confirmed that four boys had been rescued from the Tham Luang cave in Thailand, where their soccer team and coach became trapped on June 23. Officials said the four boys conditions were not that bad, and they were taken to a hospital about 35 miles (56 km) away for further evaluation. Rescue operations resumed on Monday and four more boys were rescued.\nThe four boys rescued Monday were also taken to the hospital for evaluation. That day, Narongsak said, \"I insist that all [boys and their coach] will be safe and sound.\nIn between rescue operations, divers must replenish the supply of oxygen tanks along the route, a process that takes about 10 to 20 hours, according to Narongsak. A team of 90 divers, including 40 from Thailand, have participated in the rescue operation since it started. Narongsak said 13 foreign divers and five Thai navy SEALs aided in the operation on Sunday. He said rescuers had been rehearsing the operation over the last three or four days.\nOn Sunday, rescuers said water levels had dropped in the cave by nearly a foot since the previous day. There had been a lack of rain in the preceding days, and authorities had been pumping water out of the caves. We have reached peak readiness, Narongsak said. The meaning of readiness is perfect weather, water and the kids readiness, physical (sic) and mentally.\nThe boys, their coach and their families had all agreed that they should be moved out as soon as possible, according to Narongsak. \nAuthorities decided to start the rescue attempt at 10 a.m. local time Sunday. Narongsak said the first boy came out of the cave at 5:40 p.m. local time, the next 10 minutes later, and the other two at 7:40 and 7:50 p.m. local time. Authorities did not release the names of the four boys to the media. \nAuthorities ordered media away from the cave before the rescue to clear a path for transporting them to the hospital and to protect their privacy, according to The Associated Press. The hospital evaluation was to include an examination of the boys for potential long-term health effects from lack of oxygen, since levels in the cave were measured at 15 percent. The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) considers an oxygen level below 19.5 percent to be oxygen-deficient and immediately dangerous to life or health.\nThe trip out of the cave\nBritish divers found the team about 2.5 miles (4 km) from the cave entrance last Monday. The trip out of the cave involved wading in water, diving along guide ropes placed by previous divers, walking and climbing. The boys had been learning to dive since rescuers found them on July 2. During the diving sections, the boys wore full-face masks, and two experienced divers accompanied them and carried their air tanks. \nThe boys traveled more than half a mile underwater, according to NBC News. In the first 0.6 miles (1 km) of the trip, the boys had to pass through a flooded channel that was narrow enough that divers were required to hold their oxygen tanks in front of them because they could not fit through the channel with the tanks on their backs. \nThe round trip to where the team was and back out of the cave was previously reported to take about 11 hours. After efforts to drain some water from the cave, the round trip may have been shortened by at least three and a half hours, CNN reported. Officials had at one point estimated the trip out of the cave could take the boys two to four days to complete.\nOn Friday, former Thai navy SEAL, Saman Gunan, died while returning from delivering oxygen tanks in the cave. \nThe soccer team entered the cave when it was dry. When it began flooding, the team took shelter on a ledge above water in a cavern. To hydrate, the boys licked drops of water off the cave wall prior to the divers discovering them, according to NBC News. Thai and international rescuers have brought food, oxygen and supplies to the team while they await rescue.\nFuture operations\nOn Sunday, Narongsak said, Theres no time limit on the operation. It depends on the weather. It depends on the water levels. If something changes well stop. But I expect the operation to finish in the next couple of days. \nForecasters have predicted monsoon rains in the coming days. The monsoon season could flood the route out of the caves until October, CNN reported. CNN meteorologist Allison Chinchar said there is an 80 to 90 percent chance of rain Monday through Wednesday, and the long-term forecast predicts rain for the next seven to 10 days. Rain began falling after the first four boys exited the cave on Sunday.\nA spokesman for Elon Musks Boring Company, which has four engineers at the cave, said Sunday that Thai officials had requested what Musk called a tiny kid-sized submarine made using the liquid oxygen transfer tube of [a Space X] Falcon rocket as [a] hull be sent to them. The mini-sub could possibly be used in future rescues. Musk tweeted at 5:49 p.m. EDT on Sunday that it would be arriving in Thailand in about 17 hours, which would have put it there at about 9:49 p.m. local time (10:49 a.m. EDT) on Monday.\nSources:ABC News,AP, BBC, CNN, NBC News",

He is scheduled to meet with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Delhi on Friday. Trudeau also rescinded an invitation that had previously been extended to meet with a member of a group that is prohibited in India. \nOn Tuesday in Mumbai, Trudeau announced more than $1 billion in investment agreements between Canadian and Indian businesses. The prime ministers office said the deals would lead to the creation of more than 5,800 good, well-paying middle class jobs for Canadians. The office did not provide details about the agreements. Trudeau also participated with a womens leadership roundtable, joined a discussion at the Canada-India Business Forum, and met with Bollywood actors on Tuesday.\nThe Canadian leader was initially scheduled to attend a reception with Jaspal Atwal, who was convicted of attempted murder in 1986 for trying to kill an Indian politician visiting Canada. The Canadian delegation rescinded the invitation when it learned who Atwal was and that hes a member of a banned separatist group, Reuters reported. Trudeau told reporters on Thursday that the member of parliament who included Atwal on a list of invitees assumed full responsibility for his actions. \nPoliticians and people on social media criticized Trudeaus and his familys decision to dress in traditional Indian apparel on multiple occasions, including an outfit traditionally worn by grooms at weddings.

      "Content": "In the U.S., there are at least 718 monuments and statues, 109 public schools, 80 cities or counties, 10 U.S. military bases, and nine state holidays representing or honoring the Confederacy or its leaders, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC). While some states have laws or ordinances prohibiting the removal of such monuments, at least 14 statues have been removed since 2015. Some decisions to remove statues have occurred after multiple public debates, followed by a city council vote.\nThe statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee in Charlottesville, Virginia, has been the most widely covered in the media over the past week. The following is a list of other states that have removed Confederate monuments, and states that prohibit such action:\nRemoval efforts by state:\nCalifornia: On Aug. 16, the United Daughters of the Confederacy asked the Hollywood Forever Cemetery to remove a 1925 Confederate monument that marked the graves of at least 30 Confederate veterans and family members, according to CNN. The monument had been featured in a Los Angeles Times op-ed. The United Daughters, who own the statue, didnt provide a reason for the removal. However, a Change.org petition was drafted requesting the owners remove the monument.\nFlorida: In May, the Alachua County Commission in Gainesville, Florida, voted 4-1 to donate the towns Confederate statue to the United Daughters of the Confederacy, which had originally installed the statue at the countys Administration Building in 1904. The group had 60 days to decide whether to accept the donation and pay for its removal. On Aug. 14, the association paid to relocate the statue to a local cemetery. After holding three meetings on whether to remove the statue, the county commission voted to replace the statue with something that represents the shared values of its residents, according to the Gainesville Sun. Although the article says that the debate about the statue began in 2015 after Dylann Roof killed nine African-American churchgoers, it didnt provide the reason for its eventual removal.\nIn June, the city of Orlando began the process of moving a Confederate statue from Lake Eola Park to a cemetery. The statue was originally given to the city in 1911 by the United Daughters of the Confederacy. In May, the mayor gave his reasons for removal: These statues are subject to various interpretations. Some, like myself, see them as historical markers dedicated to men who died during a war. Other perceive it as a symbol of white supremacy and the vestige of slavery. With this understanding and our Citys commitment to inclusiveness, I am proposing to move the statue to a more appropriate location at Greenwood Cemetery within the confederate veterans section. He added, As we move this plan forward, I believe this proposal balances the inclusive morals of our community today, while carefully preserving historic artifacts from our past that can be used to further educate and serve as important lessons in todays society.\nKentucky: In April 2016, Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer announced plans to remove a Confederate monument from 1895. Fischer cited practical reasons, such as new traffic patterns around the statue, and civic reasons, such as residents having objected to a Confederate monument on public land. After his announcement, a group of residents and the Sons of Confederate Veterans filed a lawsuit against its removal. The city ultimately won the lawsuit and relocated the statue to Brandenburg, Kentucky, in November 2016.\nLouisiana: In December 2015, New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu signed an ordinance calling for the removal and relocation of four Confederate monuments displayed on public property in the city. The city council approved the ordinance by a 6-to-1 vote and declared the monuments public nuisances pursuant to Section 146-611 of the city code. In April 2017, the mayor announced plans to remove the first of the four monuments. The mayor said at the time that the city came to this decision after a lengthy public process that determined these statues failed to appropriately reflect the values of diversity and inclusion that make New Orleans strong today. The last monument was removed in May.\nMaryland: In July 2017, a statue of a Confederate soldier was removed from Rockville, Marylands Red Brick Courthouse. According to The New York Times, the United Daughters of the Confederacy donated the statue in 1913 and County Executive Isiah Leggett ordered its removal from government property in 2015. Upon its removal, Leggett said, this statue is inaccurate because it pays tribute only to the more than 200 Montgomery County young men who fought for the Confederacy, not also to those County residents who fought to preserve the Union and free those held in bondage. Therefore the statue does not represent a balanced view of our Countys sacrifice during the Civil War.\nIn August, Baltimore Mayor Catherine Pugh ordered the removal of four Confederate statues in the city. In an interview with The New York Times, Mayor Pugh said it was in the best interest of the city, citing security concerns after the protest in Charlottesville, Virginia. The Times says the city hasnt announced plans for their relocation.\nMissouri: St. Louis officials began dismantling a Confederate statue in a park in June. Though media outlets mention that the statue was often vandalized, they dont provide a reason for its removal. Under a legal agreement, the Missouri Civil War Museum has agreed to take ownership of the statue and its removal.\n More states: New York, Wisconsin, Alabama, Georgia, Texas and Washington have either made plans or are reviewing plans to remove some of their Confederate monuments, with some noting societal divisions as the motive for their removal, according to CNN. \nOfficials from Arizona and Pennsylvania have opposed the removal of their states Confederate monuments. Arizona Governor Doug Ducey said, Its not my desire or mission to tear down any monuments or memorials. We have a public process for this. If the public wants to be engaged on this, Id invite them to get engaged in it. And Pennsylvanias Gettysburg National Military Park said it has no plans to remove any of its 1,300-plus monuments, markers or plaques. \nSome states that prohibit statue removal:\nGeorgia: Title 50, article 3, section 1 of the states code says It shall be unlawful for any person, firm, corporation, or other entity to mutilate, deface, defile, or abuse contemptuously any publicly owned monument, plaque, marker, or memorial which is dedicated to, honors, or recounts the military service of any past or present military personnel of this state, the United States of America or the several states thereof, or the Confederate States of America or the several states thereof, and no officer, body, or representative of state or local government or any department, agency, authority, or instrumentality thereof shall remove or conceal from display any such monument, plaque, marker, or memorial for the purpose of preventing the visible display of the same. A violation of this paragraph shall constitute a misdemeanor.\nMississippi: State code 55-15-81, enacted in 2013, says no War Between the States monuments or memorials on public property shall be relocated, removed, disturbed, altered, renamed or rededicated, unless the structure interferes with the construction, maintenance or operation of public transportation facilities.\nNorth Carolina: The Cultural History Artifact Management and Patriotism Act of 2015 restricts the removal, relocation or alteration of any monument located on public property without the approval of the North Carolina Historical Commission.\nSouth Carolina: Section 10-1-165 of the state constitution says no War Between the States monuments or memorials erected on public property of the State or any of its political subdivisions may be relocated, removed, disturbed, or altered. The statute may change upon passage of an act which has received a two-thirds vote on the third reading of the bill in each branch of the General Assembly.\nTennessee: This states Heritage Protection Act of 2016 also prohibits the removal of statues, monuments, etc., erected to honor military conflicts, historical military figures and events, or historic organizations located on public property.\nAn SPLC timeline of Confederate installations can be found here.\nA New York Times list of states that have proposed to remove their Confederate statues can be found here.",

      "Content": "Facebook suspends Cambridge Analytica, SCL, says data shared with third parties violated platform policies\nIn a March 16 statement, Facebook announced it was suspending the accounts of the political data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica, its affiliate Strategic Communication Laboratories (SCL), University of Cambridge psychology professor Aleksandr Kogan, and Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, Inc. The social networking company said the decision was in response to two violations of its platform policies. The first was Kogan providing data from an app that collected Facebook profile information to third parties  namely Cambridge Analytica and SCL. The second was the parties reported non-compliance with deleting said information after they certified to Facebook they had destroyed the data.\nThe New York Times and The Observer (a weekly U.K. newspaper owned by Guardian Media Group) published exclusive reports detailing the events and a dossier provided by Wylie, who worked at Cambridge Analytica until late 2014. The outlets described the collection and use of the information as a data breach. \nFacebook updated its statement on March 17, saying, The claim that this is a data breach is completely false. Aleksandr Kogan requested and gained access to information from users who chose to sign up to his app, and everyone involved gave their consent. People knowingly provided their information, no systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.\nCambridge Analytica also issued a statement on March 17 saying it had not knowingly breached any of Facebooks terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted.\nOn March 19, Cambridge Analytica suspended its CEO, Alexander Nix, shortly before a Channel 4 News report aired in the U.K., according to CNN. Undercover footage shows Nix claiming he met then candidate Donald Trump many times, and that Cambridge Analytica did all the research, all the data, all the analytics, all the targeting for his presidential campaign. The footage also captures Nix discussing potential bribery and entrapment. \nThe firm responded to Channel 4s alleged use of entrapment and mischaracterization with a statement saying, The report is edited and scripted to grossly misrepresent the nature of those conversations and how the company conducts its business. The company added that Nix acknowledges that on this occasion he misjudged the situation.\nAbout the data collection\nAccording to Wylie, Kogan provided data he collected from more than 50 million Facebook profiles to Cambridge Analytica, which he reportedly obtained from the social network in accordance with its policies. Referring to the 50 million profiles, The Observer said they mostly belonged to registered U.S. voters.\nAbout 30 million of the profiles contained information such as user identities, places of residence, friend networks and content that users liked on the platform. Cambridge Analytica used the information to match users to other data and build psychographic profiles, in order to develop campaign ads and other campaign strategies in U.S. elections and possibly the Brexit referendum. (Psychographics is market research or statistics classifying population groups according to psychological variables.) About 270,000 users consented to having their data collected; the rest of the data was sourced from app users friend networks.\nInvestigations\nCambridge Analytica is being investigated by three parties: Britains Electoral Commission is investigating its possible involvement in the Brexit referendum; the British Information Commissioners Office is investigating the firm as part of an ongoing inquiry into the use of data analytics for political purposes; and in the U.S., Special Counsel Robert Mueller has obtained emails from company employees who worked for the Trump campaign as part of his investigation into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\nOn March 19, Facebook said it hired digital forensics firm Stroz Friedberg to audit Cambridge Analytica to check whether it retained Facebook user data. According to Facebook, Cambridge Analytica agreed to comply with the audit.\nOn March 20, attorneys general for Massachusetts and New York announced a joint investigation into Cambridge Analytica and Facebook. The attorneys general have reportedly requested the firm to provide information concerning the potential misuse of user data, NBC News reported. The outlet said they are also investigating why Facebook did not tell users or the public that the data was handed over to a third party, adding that Connecticut and Pennsylvania announced similar inquiries on Monday.\nReported timeline of events\nCambridge Analytica LLC was incorporated on Dec. 31, 2013 in Delaware, as a joint venture between the elections division of London-based SCL and American hedge fund co-CEO Robert Mercer, who invested $15 million in the company. Steve Bannon, who later became White House Chief Strategist under Trump, also invested and worked as vice president of the companys board. Alexander Nix is CEO of both SCL and Cambridge Analytica UK, a separate entity from the Delaware-based corporation.\nIn 2014, Cambridge Analytica signed a contract with Global Science Research (GSR), a company founded by Kogan. GSR was hired to do research and collect data from Facebook users. Kogan built the app thisisyourdigitallife, which was described on Facebook as a research app used by psychologists. \nThe app paid Facebook users to take a personality test. Approximately 270,000 people downloaded the app, took the survey and consented to sharing information such as the city they set on their profile, or content they had liked, as well as more limited information about friends who had their privacy settings set to allow it, according to Facebooks statement. The cost for GSR to acquire the data was approximately $800,000, and paid for by Cambridge Analytica, according to company emails and financial records examined by the outlets.\nAccording to Wylie, he and a team of psychologists and data scientists employed by the company used the raw data to build psychographic profiles. The company built an algorithm that used the GSR data to analyze individual Facebook profiles and determine personality traits linked to voting behavior, according to The Guardian. Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix was asked by British members of parliament if any of the companys data came from GSR, to which he responded, [GSR] did some research for us back in 2014. That research proved to be fruitless and so the answer is no.\nIn July 2014, Cambridge Analytica consulting attorney Laurence Levy sent an email to Bannon, Mercer and Nix regarding laws that limit the involvement of foreign nationals in U.S. elections. He said American citizens or green card holders should be used to manage the work and decision making functions, relative to campaign messaging and expenditures. The New York Times reported that few Americans were involved in Cambridge Analyticas work during the summer and fall of 2014, when the company provided services for the John Bolton SuperPAC, and the campaign of Republican Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina. The contracts held by Cambridge Analytica were serviced by the London-based SCL Group and most personnel were Canadian or European, according to The New York Times. In a statement to the outlet, Cambridge Analytica said, personnel in strategic roles were U.S. nationals or green card holders.\nBy early 2015, Wylie and about a dozen people had left the company. Wylie then founded the firm Eunoia Technologies. The New York Times cited a Cambridge Analytica statement saying the company took legal action against Wylie to enforce intellectual property claims, claiming he engaged in \"what is clearly a malicious attempt to hurt the company.\" Regarding his work at Cambridge Analytica, Wylie told the Observer, We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of peoples profiles. And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons. That was the basis the entire company was built on.\"\nIn 2015, Facebook learned Kogan had given GSRs data to third parties. Facebooks platform policy allowed the app users data to be collected and used to improve user experience in the app and prohibited it being sold on or used for advertising, according to The Observer. Kogan reportedly violated the platform policies by passing information on to a third party, including SCL/Cambridge Analytica and Christopher Wylie, according to Facebooks statement. \nFacebook said after it learned about Kogan passing the data to Cambridge Analytica, the platform removed Kogans app and required all parties to destroy the information. Cambridge Analytica, Kogan and Wylie all confirmed they had destroyed the data, according to the same statement. \nIn 2016, Cambridge Analytica worked for Sen. Ted Cruzs (R-Texas) and Donald Trumps presidential campaigns. The companys work with the Trump campaign included designing target audiences for digital ads and fundraising events, modeling voter turnout, purchasing $5 million in television ads and deciding where Trump should travel to campaign, according to former campaign officials. In its statement, Cambridge Analytica said, no data from GSR was used by Cambridge Analytica as part of the services it provided to Trumps campaign.\nIn 2018, Wylie shared a dossier of information containing emails, invoices, contracts and bank records with The New York Times and The Observer. Wylie alleges the Facebook data was misused and that it still exists. He has provided the information to the British National Crime Agencys cyber crime unit and the British Information Commissioners Office. \nThe state of Massachusetts will be initiating an investigation into Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, according to the states attorney general, Maura Healey. \nMedia coverage\nThe outlets that broke the story suggested that Facebook, Cambridge Analytica and others may be guilty of wrongdoing for having provided or misused the information. For instance, the Observer wrote that Facebook failed to alert users and took only limited steps to recover and secure the private information. It added that the discovery of the unprecedented data harvesting, and the use to which it was put, raises urgent new questions about Facebook's role in targeting voters in the US presidential election. The outlet also described Cambridge Analytica as the data analytics firm that helped Donald Trump to victory, and The New York Times wrote that the breach allowed the company to exploit the private social media activity of a huge swath of the American electorate, developing techniques that underpinned its work on President Trump's campaign in 2016. \nCambridge Analytica claims it did not use the Facebook data for the 2016 Trump campaign. The New York Times and The Observer did not provide data to substantiate this and other implications of possible wrongdoing.\n\nSources:Cambridge Analytica statement, Facebook Blog,The Guardian, The New York Times",

      "Content": "U.K. police announced on Wednesday that a British couple who became critically ill had been exposed to Novichok, the same military-grade nerve agent that international authorities concluded was used to poison former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter on March 4. Police do not know how the two came to be exposed to the nerve agent.\nThe couple, identified as Dawn Sturgess, 44, from Salisbury, and Charlie Rowley, 45, from Amesbury, fell ill in their Amesbury home on Saturday, about 8 miles (12 km) from Sergei Skripals home in Salisbury. Paramedics arrived at the Amesbury home at 10:15 a.m. local time Saturday to treat Sturgess, and again about five hours later to treat Rowley. The two were taken to the same hospital where the Skripals had been treated.\nNeil Basu, a British counter-terrorism officer, said that scientists at the Porton Down laboratory had determined that Novichok had caused the symptoms of Sturgess and Rowley. \nWe are not in a position to say whether the nerve agent was from the same batch that the Skripals were exposed to, Basu said. The possibility that these two investigations might be linked is clearly a line of inquiry for us. It is important, however, that the investigation is led by the evidence available and the facts alone and we dont make any assumptions.\nBasu noted that people in the area can expect to see an increased police presence, which will include officers wearing protective equipment. On Wednesday, police cordoned off multiple places where the couple had been before they got sick, including the Queen Elizabeth Gardens in Salisbury, within walking distance of where the Skripals fell ill. \nAfter the Skripal attack, health officials decontaminated multiple areas, and said that there might still be hot spots where Novichok could still be present, according to The New York Times. Ian Boyd, a chief scientific adviser at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, said in April that the chemical does not degrade quickly. He added at that time, You can assume it is not much different now from the day it was distributed.\nThe group of Novichok chemicals (Russian for newcomer) were produced in the 1970s and 1980s by Soviet Union laboratories. The agents block the breakdown of a neurotransmitter that controls muscular contractions, which leads to respiratory and cardiac arrest, according to Vil Mirzayanov, a chemist who helped develop the chemicals and who spoke to investigators following the breakup of the Soviet Union.\nBritish investigators found the highest concentration of Novichok that poisoned the Skripals on Sergeis front door. British Prime Minister Theresa May said it was highly likely that Russia was responsible for that attack. The U.K., and more than 20 other countries, expelled a total of 150 Russian diplomats in support of the U.K. determination. Russia has denied responsibility for the attack. The country responded to the expulsions by saying it would expel a total of 150 diplomats from those countries.\nSergei and his daughter Yulia were later released from the hospital after they had sufficiently recovered from some of the effects of their poisoning. \nSources: The Guardian, The New York Times",

      "Content": "A wildfire in northern California has killed two firefighters and destroyed 65 buildings as of Friday, Cal Fire officials said. Thousands of residents have left the area under an evacuation order. The fire, called the Carr Fire, started Monday and tripled in size over Thursday night, to 45 square miles (115 square kilometers). Cal Fire attributed the spread to triple-digit temperatures, low humidity and windy conditions. \nA firefighter with the Redding Fire Department was killed on Friday, officials said, the second of the Carr Fire. On Thursday night, crews also found the body of a bulldozer operator who had been hired to clear vegetation in the fires path, confirmed Scott McLean, a Cal Fire spokesman. The deceased have not been publicly identified. \nMcLean said that three firefighters and several civilians had also been injured by the fires. \nThe Carr Fire is believed to have been started by a mechanical issue with a vehicle near Whiskeytown, about 30 miles west of Redding, according to Cal Fire. It spread through neighboring communities and then wind pushed it across the Sacramento River into the city of Redding, with a population of about 92,000, on Thursday. \nEvacuation orders are in place for more than 37,000 residents of Shasta County, where Redding is located. Some residents have moved to hotels, homes of family members elsewhere, or a shelter outside of town, The Associated Press reported. Shasta College and Weaverville Elementary School set up evacuation centers, according to SFGate news outlet. \nReally, were in a life-saving mode right now in Redding, said Cal Fire unit chief Jonathan Cox. Were not fighting a fire. Were trying to move people out of the path of it because it is now deadly, and it is now moving at speeds and in ways we have not seen before in this area.\nThe Mercy Medical Center, a hospital in Redding, was preparing high-risk patients to be evacuated, but did not yet plan to move them, a spokesman said. It did evacuate five babies from its neonatal intensive care unit.\nAs of Friday, the Carr Fire had burned 44,450 acres and was 3 percent contained. Officials from the state Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said nearly 5,000 homes were at risk of burning, in addition to the 55 that were destroyed and another 55 that were damaged. \nTemperatures are forecast to be around 110 degrees Fahrenheit over the weekend, with humidity as low as 10 percent, National Weather Service meteorologist Eric Gurth said, which could increase the spread of the fire. We might be seeing some considerable fire growth if that cycle continues, which it looks like it will, he said.\nMore than 1,700 personnel are working to contain the fire, including those servicing 10 engines, 10 helicopters and 22 bulldozers. California Gov. Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency for the county on Thursday, which allows state agencies, such as the Office of Emergency Services, to direct resources to the local government.\nThe Carr Fire is one of dozens of wildfires currently burning in California, including one outside Yosemite National Park that killed a heavy equipment operator earlier this month, and the Cranston Fire to the south, from which 3,000 residents have been evacuated. \nSources: AP, SFGate",

      "Content": "President Donald Trump signed a $1.3 trillion spending bill on Friday after it had passed the U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday and the Senate on Friday. The bill passed the House 256-167 and the Senate 65-32. Trump signed it shortly before 1:30 p.m., prior to the midnight Friday deadline required to continue to fund the government and avoid a shutdown. The law will fund the government through at least Sept. 30, the end of the 2018 fiscal year, and some government programs will be funded past that date.\nAt around 9 a.m. Eastern, Trump tweeted that he was considering vetoing the spending bill because it didnt include a provision for DACA recipients (or the so-called Dreamers who were illegally brought to the country as children) or full funding for a wall along the border with Mexico. Trump said he was unhappy about signing the bill, but was forced to because we want to build our military.\nAfter signing the bill, Trump also said that we have to get rid of the filibuster rule and move toward requiring 50 votes in the Senate to pass budget bills in the future. \nThe 2,232 page House version of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 includes:\n\n\t$654.6 billion for the Department of Defense, an increase of $61.1 billion over the 2017 enacted spending level.\n\ta pay raise for military personnel of 2.4 percent, as part of the defense budget.\n\tan increase of $196 million to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) budget to $11.431 billion, with $320 million of the budget allocated for implementing tax reforms passed last year.\n\ta budget for the Secret Service of approximately $2 billion through 2019, including money to pay for overtime worked in 2017, according to The Washington Post.\n\tan increase of $263 million to FBI funding for salaries and expenses, bringing its budget to $9.03 billion.\n\tmore funding for prevention, treatment, and law enforcement for opioid abuse, allocating an additional $3 billion to bring the allocated budget for the issue to $4.65 billion, according to The Washington Post.\n\tfunding of $1.6 billion for fencing along the U.S.-Mexico border, including $196 million for border-security technology.\n\tan increase of $3 million in funding to the National Endowments for the Arts and Humanities to $152.8 million each.\n\ta $166 million budget for the National Gallery of Art, which is an increase of more than $10 million.\n\tan increase of $3.8 million to $40.5 million for the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts.\n\tallocating $380 million to the Election Assistance Commission to improve the administration of elections, including election technology and security measures.\n\tfunding for some Federal Aviation Administration programs through September.\n\tfunding for the National Flood Insurance Program through July.\n\n\n The bill also included some non-budgetary measures, such as:\n\n\tthe Fix NICS Act to improve the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS).\n\ta prohibition on employers, such as restaurant owners, from keeping the tips of their employees.\n\n\n Some further items the bill includes can be found here, and the entire bill is available here. \nSources: House Appropriations Committee, Politico, The Washington Post, USA Today",

The U.S. House of Representatives voted 224-201 in favor of passing the final version of the bill. No Democrats voted in favor of the bill and 12 Republicans voted against it. \nThe House passed a version on Tuesday and sent it to the Senate for approval. The Senate parliamentarian ruled that three provisions in the version did not comply with the Senates Byrd Rule, including the bills name. The title was then changed to, An Act to provide for reconciliation pursuant to titles II and V of the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2018. The Senate voted 51 to 48 in favor of changing the provisions, then sent the bill back to the House for reapproval. \nIn findings released Monday, Congress Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) estimated that middle-class Americans would receive half of the bills tax cuts and 14 percent of the tax cuts would go to individuals with income over $1 million a year. \nThe JCT projects that in 2019, all income groups will see an 8 percent reduction in taxes and that by 2027, taxpayers earning up to $75,000 will have a tax increase. Earlier this month, the JCT published a report estimating that the Senate bill at the time would increase the federal deficit by $1 trillion within the 10 years.\nThe Tax Policy Center, a private nonpartisan group, produced a separate study that estimates individual taxes will decrease by an average of $1,600 in the next year. The group estimates that those earning over $773,000 would see tax reductions averaging $51,160, those earning above $149,000 would get cuts of $7,640, and those with income below $25,000 would have a reduction of about $60. \nSources: Breitbart, CNN, Fox News, The New York Times",

      "Content": "Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) died on Saturday due to complications from glioblastoma, a type of brain cancer. He is survived by his wife, Cindy, seven children and five grandchildren.\nMcCain was diagnosed with glioblastoma last summer and underwent radiation treatment for the disease. The family announced that he was discontinuing his treatment the Friday before his death.\nThe six-term senator was a military veteran who spent time as a prisoner of war and unsuccessfully ran for the presidency as the Republican nominee in 2008. He served on several congressional committees. More recently, McCain publicly criticized and opposed some of President Donald Trumps policies and initiatives. For instance, he voted against the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare. \nMemorial services will be held at the Arizona State Capitol, the North Phoenix Baptist Church, the U.S. Capitol, and Washington National Cathedral from Aug. 29 through Sept. 1. He will be buried at the U.S. Naval Academy Cemetery in Annapolis, Maryland.\nMcCain also wrote a farewell letter to Americans, in which he said it was a privilege to serve the U.S., spoke about the ideals of America, and thanked his family. A family spokesperson read it at a press conference and his daughter Meghan posted it on Twitter. \nEarly life\nJohn McCain was born on Aug. 29, 1936, at Coco Solo Naval Air Station in the Panama Canal Zone to Lieutenant John McCain Jr. and Roberta Wright McCain. He was the familys second child, born after his older sister, Sandy, and before his younger brother, Joe. McCains family moved often as part of his fathers military service, according to his memoir The Restless Wave.\nDuring his high school years at Episcopal High School, a private boys boarding school in Alexandria, Virginia, McCain participated in the wrestling and football teams. After graduating from high school, he joined the U.S. Naval Academy (USNA). \nMcCains years in the military \nMcCain graduated from the USNA in 1958, after which he pursued training as a naval aviator for two years. He studied at the Pensacola Naval Air Station and the Corpus Christi Naval Air Station. While at Corpus Christi, McCain crashed his plane, a single-engine AD-6 Skyraider, into Corpus Christi Bay on a training run. His biography noted that he came to in time to swim to the surface and return to his quarters in good enough shape to keep his plans for a night on the town.\nAfter graduating from flight school in 1960, McCain reported for duty at Norfolk Naval Station. He was deployed on the U.S.S. Intrepid for several Mediterranean assignments.\nIn 1962, he was deployed to the Navys first nuclear powered aircraft carrier, the U.S.S. Enterprise, and later that year was promoted to lieutenant. The U.S.S. Enterprise was involved in the blockade of Cuba during the U.S.-Cuban Missile Crisis.\nIn 1965, while stationed at the Meridian Naval Air Station, he married Carol Shepp and adopted her two sons from a previous marriage, Doug and Andy. In 1966, he and Carol had a daughter named Sidney. That same year, McCain was deployed to Vietnam for combat duty.\nWhile flying in a mission to bomb a thermal power plant in Hanoi, Vietnam, in 1967, McCains plane was struck by a surface-to-air missile, causing him to crash. He broke his left arm, his right arm in three places and his right knee during the crash. When he woke up, he was taken by the Vietnamese to Hoa Lo prison, which housed other U.S. pilots captured by the Vietnamese military. \nMcCains biography noted that he was only taken to a hospital after Vietnamese soldiers learned that his father was an admiral. During his hospital stay, he was interrogated. After unsuccessful attempts at fixing his broken limbs, McCain asked to be sent to a hospital with other U.S. prisoners of war. He was then placed in a cell with two Air Force majors, George Day and Norris Overly, whom McCain said saved his life.\nIn 1968, the Vietnamese reportedly presented McCain with the opportunity to leave the prison camp in an attempt to embarrass McCains father, who was about to assume command of U.S. forces in the Pacific. His biography stated that the Vietnamese wanted to claim that McCain took amnesty while his fellow prisoners, lacking privileged parents, were left behind to suffer more privation and danger. McCain refused the offer. \nOver a series of several days, the Vietnamese soldiers allegedly beat McCain until he agreed to confess to war crimes. They taped his confession and sent it to McCains father. McCain was later moved back to the Hoa Lo prison. \nOn March 14, 1973, McCain was released. Upon his arrival back to the U.S., McCain received several military honors: the Silver Star, the Distinguished Flying Cross, three Bronze Stars, two Purple Hearts, and the Prisoner-of-War medal.\nHe was promoted to commander in July 1973, and later enrolled in the National War College at Fort McNair in Washington, D.C. He studied the history of the French and American wars in Vietnam. \nIn 1974, McCain was assigned to the Replacement Air Group VA-174 at Cecil Field in Jacksonville, Florida. By 1976, he served as the squadrons commanding officer. In 1980, after failing his flight physical, McCain decided to retire from the Navy and begin a career in politics.\nMcCains years in politics\nIn 1980, McCain relocated to Phoenix, Arizona, after he divorced his wife, Carol, and married to Cindy Hensley later that year. In 1982, McCain ran for an Arizona Congressional seat and won. \nWhen then-Senator Barry Goldwater announced that he would retire from the Senate at the end of his term in 1986, McCain decided to run for Goldwaters seat and ultimately won it. \nDuring his time as senator, McCain participated in the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, the Select Committee on Indian Affairs, and the Armed Services Committee.\nIn 1999, McCain attempted to win the Republican nomination for president, and lost to George W. Bush. In 2008, McCain earned the Republican nomination for president but lost the general election against then-Senator Barack Obama. \nMcCain stayed on as a U.S. senator. He won each reelection from 1987 until his last election in 2016, for a total of six senate terms.\nResponses to his death\nFormer President George W. Bushs statement about McCains passing read: Some lives are so vivid, it is difficult to imagine them ended. Some voices are so vibrant, it is hard to think of them stilled. John McCain was a man of deep conviction and a patriot of the highest order. He was a public servant in the finest traditions of our country. And to me, he was a friend whom I'll deeply miss. Laura and I send our heartfelt sympathies to Cindy and the entire McCain family, and our thanks to God for the life of John McCain.\nFormer President Obamas abridged statement said: Few of us have been tested the way John once was, or required to show the kind of courage that he did. But all of us can aspire to the courage to put the greater good above our own. At Johns best, he showed us what that means. And for that, we are all in his debt. Michelle and I sent our most heartfelt condolences to Cindy and her family.\nPresident Donald Trumps statement: My deepest sympathies and respect go out to the family of Senator John McCain. Our hearts and prayers are with you!\nMcCain had reportedly asked that both Obama and Bush speak at his funeral. McCains family has asked that Trump not attend his funeral, The Associated Press reported. \n\nSources: Bush Presidential Center, CBS News, McCain biography, McCain family statement, Obama Twitter, Trump Twitter",

      "Content": "The Atlantic hurricane season for 2018 runs from June 1 to Nov. 30. The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) predicted the following:\n\n\tNine to 13 named storms (tropical storms and hurricanes are named to reduce confusion when multiple storms happen simultaneously).\n\tFour to seven hurricanes (tropical storms with wind speeds greater than 73 mph, or 117 km/h).\n\tAs many as two major hurricanes (Anything beyond a Category 2 hurricane is considered major).\n\tThe combined strength and duration of hurricanes, measured by the Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) index, is within 50 to 100 percent of the normal median average.\n\nNOAA considers the number of storms and their severity for 2018 to be below-normal or near-normal when based on season averages from 1981 to 2010. The seasonal hurricane average includes 12 named storms, six hurricanes and three major hurricanes.\nThe 2018 season has experienced 10 named storms so far: Alberto, Beryl, Chris, Debby, Ernesto, Florence, Gordon, Helene, Isaac and Joyce. The NOAA has not issued final reports, which include maximum sustained wind speeds, for the latter four storms.\nThe 2018 storms:\n\n\tAlberto was a sub-tropical storm, which has the characteristics of a hurricane but with a maximum sustained surface wind speed of at least 39 mph (63 km/h). Alberto traveled between Mexico and Cuba from May 25 to May 31, heading north toward the Gulf Coast before making landfall in Florida and Alabama.\n\tBeryl was a hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 80 mph (130 km/h). It lasted from July 5 to July 15, passing near the Caribbean islands of Guadeloupe, Dominica, Martinique, St. Lucia and Barbados.\n\tHurricane Chris lasted from July 6 to July 12, and had maximum sustained winds of 105 mph (169 km/h). It formed in the Atlantic ocean between Bermuda and the North Carolina coast, but did not make landfall.\n\tWith maximum sustained winds of 50 mph (80 km/h), Tropical Storm Debby also did not reach land. It lasted from Aug. 7 to Aug. 9 in the north Atlantic Ocean.\n\tTropical Storm Ernesto lasted from Aug. 15 to Aug. 18 and traveled north over the Atlantic Ocean. It had maximum sustained winds of 45 mph (72 km/h). \n\tHurricane Florence formed off the coast of Africa on Aug. 31 and moved northwest toward the U.S. It made landfall off the coast of North Carolina on Sept. 14 and had maximum sustained winds of 140 mph (225 km/h).\n\tTropical Storm Gordon formed off the coast of Florida and headed northwest over the Gulf Coast between Sept. 2 and Sept. 7. The storm made landfall in Mississippi on Sept 5. \n\tHurricane Helene formed off the coast of Africa and headed northwest over the Atlantic before turning northeast toward Ireland. Helene was downgraded to a tropical storm before making landfall. The NOAA tracked the storm from Sept. 7 to Sept. 16.\n\tNOAA tracked Hurricane Isaac from Sept. 7 to Sept. 15 as it traveled west near Puerto Rico over the Caribbean. \n\tTropical Storm Joyce began on Sept. 12 in the Atlantic Ocean. The storm was downgraded to a tropical depression on Sept. 16. It has not made landfall.\n\n\n\n\nSources: Alberto, Beryl, Chris, Debby, Ernesto, Florence, Gordon, Helene, Isaac, Joyce, NOAA 2018 forecast, NOAA glossary, NOAA storm naming, NOAA summary",

      "Content": "On Friday, Attorney General Jeff Sessions instructed the state attorneys general offices along the southern border with Mexico to immediately adopt a new zero-tolerance policy for immigrants illegally entering the U.S. The policy affects offenses under 8 U.S.C.  1325(a), which the Department of Justice (DOJ) says prohibits both illegal entry and attempted illegal entry. \nWhen introducing the new zero-tolerance policy, the DOJ cited a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) report that the number of known illegal border crossings increased 203 percent from March 2017 to March 2018. In March, there were 50,308 people apprehended at the border, an increase of 37 percent from the previous month. The figure does not account for any immigrants who may have entered the country undetected. \nWhile introducing the policy, Sessions said that Congress has failed to pass effective legislation that would close dangerous loopholes and fully fund a wall along the Mexican border. \nIn a memorandum to prosecutors in border districts, Sessions said that if adopting the policy requires additional resources, the offices should request them. The memo also said the goal of the policy was not simply more cases, rather to end the illegality in our immigration system. \nImmigration courts are administered as a part of the executive branch of the government, under a delegated authority from the attorney general, rather than as part of the judicial branch. AP reported that as of Oct. 1 last year, immigration judges were each expected to process 700 cases per year. There are currently about 700,000 immigration cases pending, according to AP.\nBorder protection\nEarlier this week, President Donald Trump said that he would send the military to guard the border with Mexico until the U.S. has a wall and proper security. The White House has since said that Trump is authorizing deployment of National Guard units to the border to aid U.S. Border Patrol agents.\nThe National Guard, in coordination with governors, will remain in a support role until Congress takes the action necessary to close the loopholes undermining our border security efforts, including ending the practice of Catch and Release, according to the White House. Catch and release refers to the process under which U.S. authorities can detain illegal immigrants and then release them in the U.S. while they are waiting for court hearings.\nDHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said in a press briefing on Wednesday that plans were being finalized, and that it would take time to have the details in place, but we are beginning today and we are moving quickly. Nielsen said the administration was giving the governors the opportunity to review our suggestions of how the National Guard can support the Border Patrol, and would provide numbers of deployments as soon as possible.\nThe secretary added that the U.S. allows tens of millions of legal visitors every year, as well as over 1 million legal immigrants, and would continue to do so.\nThe National Guard has been deployed to the border on previous occasions: about 1,200 troops under President Barack Obama, and about 6,000 under President George W. Bush.\nSources: DOJ Press Release, Zero-Tolerance Memo, White House Briefing, White House Statement, CBP Report, AP, Fox News, Quartz",

CNN reported the men were surrounded by a crowd of almost 3,000 people and attacked by 40 in the Dhule district. Police arrived in the area after the men were killed and two of the police officers were also injured by locals, according to the Dhule Superintendent of Police.\nAccording to police, 23 people have been arrested and charged with murder and rioting during the incident, and authorities are searching for the remaining attackers. Police said they have imposed a curfew on the village as well as suspended internet and mobile services in Dhule district. \nThe five men killed were identified as Bharat Bhosale, Dadarao Bhosale, Raju Bhosale, Aganu Hingole and Bharat Mawale, according to BBC. Police said they belonged to a nomadic community and had been begging as they passed through the village. \nOther lynchings in India\nLast week, three people were killed in the northeastern state of Tripura after social media and WhatsApp messages warned about child abduction. Smriti Ranjan Das, a police official, said people were alleging on social media that child abductors looking for human organs such as kidneys and livers were in the area to kidnap children. One of the men who was killed in that incident had been hired by the Tripura administration to make public announcements through a loudspeaker about false rumors. \nIn June, a crowd lynched two men in northeastern Assam after they had stopped their car to ask for directions. Messages on social media said the men were holding a child in their car. \nIn May, a group of locals killed a transgender woman and injured three other women in the city of Hyderabad, after messages on WhatsApp said transgender women were kidnapping children.\nAlso in May, people lynched a 55-year-old woman in Tamil Nadu state after she gave sweets to children. Police arrested 30 people in connection with the incident.\nAuthorities respond\nIn Dhule district, police have run ads in local newspapers and on TV to inform people about false messages.\nIn Assam, police are monitoring social media sites.\nIn June, police and residents in Hyderabad participated in a march with loudspeakers, saying, don't believe the rumors.\nIn Tamil, authorities have run awareness drives, to inform the public about false messages, according to BBC. \nPolice in the southern state of Telangana have issued warnings and arrested people who propagated false video messages online.\nAccording to Statista, more than 200 million Indians used Whatsapp in 2017, of Indias population of more than 1.3 billion. \nSources: BBC, CNN",

The airstrikes were the first such attacks by Russian warplanes in three weeks, BBC reported. The death toll is expected to rise, the Observatory reported.\nLast week, Reuters reported that the Syrian government was planning an attack on Idlib, which the outlet described as the last major opposition-held area in Syria. Russia, which supports Syrian President Bashar Assads government, said on Tuesday that Idlib province was a nest of terrorism, adding that the presence of militants in the area could undermine the Syrian peace process.\nA fairly large group of terrorists has settled there and of course this leads to a general destabilization of the situation, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. It undermines attempts to bring the situation onto the track of a political-diplomatic settlement. \nThe U.N. has said a full-scale military operation on Idlib could risk a humanitarian catastrophe. About 3 million people live in Idlib and surrounding areas, and some of them have already been displaced and relocated there since the beginning of the war more than seven years ago, the Associated Press reported.\nOn Monday, U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted that he opposed any airstrikes in the region. President Bashar al-Assad of Syria must not recklessly attack Idlib Province, Trump wrote. The Russians and Iranians would be making a grave humanitarian mistake to take part in this potential human tragedy. Hundreds of thousands of people could be killed. Dont let that happen!\nThe Observatory reported on Tuesday that the Russian warplanes carried out about 38 raids across 20 different militant-held areas in the western countryside of Idlib and surrounding areas in the northeastern countryside of Lattakia province.\n",

      "Content": "French unions went on strike on Thursday and workers protested in French cities over President Emmanuel Macrons proposed labor reforms to the state-owned rail company and other public sectors. Unions representing air traffic controllers, train conductors, teachers and nurses joined the strikes. The work stoppages led to a reduction in train service (60 percent of the TGV high-speed trains and 50 percent of the regional trains), as well as the cancellation of about 30 percent of the flights in and out of Paris on Thursday. Macrons proposed labor reforms include a plan to cut 120,000 government jobs over his five-year term.\nMacron has also proposed maintaining pay for some public workers at its current rate, outsourcing and offering voluntary buyouts to some employees, according to news network France 24. France has about 5.4 million state workers, The Guardian reported. Macrons proposed reforms for the rail industry include amending contracts for new hires to not include lifetime job security, and to provide them with fewer pension benefits than have been available in the past, according to France 24.\nAbout 180 protests took place in cities across the country, according to The Guardian, and most were peaceful. The outlet reported that police used tear gas and water cannons at two demonstrations, one in Paris and another in the western city of Nantes. An average of about one quarter of teachers were striking across France, according to the SNUipp-FSU union.\nThe date of the strike, March 22, is the 50th anniversary of Frances 1968 protests that included the countrys largest ever strike, and some violent incidents between police and student demonstrators in May of that year.\nA poll for the French newspaper Les chos indicated that more than half of the French population supported Thursdays strike and more than half of private sector employees opposed it.\nRailway unions have planned strikes on two out of every five days for three months from April 3 to June 28, according to The Guardian.\nLast week Macron said, We are going to continue reforming France in depth... with the certitude that our country needs this transformation to make up for the ground lost over previous decades.\nIn September of last year, there were protests against some of Macrons previous labor reforms.\nIn a poll published Wednesday by market research company Ipsos, Macrons approval rating was 37 percent, up two points from last month, while 55 percent of people view his presidency unfavorably. That figure is the highest disapproval rating since he became president in May of last year.\nRead more about the stated aims of Macrons labor reforms here. \nSources: France 24, The Guardian",

      "Content": "On Wednesday, VICE News reported some Twitter accounts were not appearing in auto-populated dropdown search boxes. The outlet said multiple Republicans accounts did not auto-populate while multiple Democrats accounts did. The next day, VICE said Twitter appears to have fixed the issue. Twitter verified this, and said the issue had affected accounts of both Democratic and Republican politicians.\nAuto-populated dropdown search boxes appear while a name is being typed into Twitters search bar, before enter is pressed. \nVICE referred to the auto-populate issue as a shadow ban on Republican accounts. Twitter said Thursday it does not shadow ban, which it said could be defined as deliberately making someones content undiscoverable to everyone except the person who posted it, unbeknownst to the original poster.\nVICEs Wednesday article\nOn Wednesday, VICE reported that if Twitter users typed in the names of certain Republicans or their spokespeople, those Twitter accounts would not auto-populate in the dropdown search box. It said the profiles did appear during a full search using the full name and pressing enter. It also said if one followed a particular account, it appeared to auto-populate in the dropdown search box.\nAccording to VICE, some of the affected accounts included Republican National Committee (RNC) chairwoman Ronna McDaniel, Reps. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), and Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), Donald Trump Jr.s spokesman Andrew Surabian, and the verified profile of Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), whose unverified account did appear to auto-populate.\nThe accounts of all 78 Congress Progressive Caucus members appeared in the auto-populate search box, VICE reported. It said the accounts of Democratic Party chairman Tom Perez and Reps. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), Joe Kennedy III (D-Mass.), Keith Ellison (D-Minn.) and Mark Pocan (D-Wis.) appeared in drop-down search results.\nVICE reported the accounts of Infowars, a media outlet that promotes conspiracy theories, its founder Alex Jones and Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) were appearing in auto-populating search boxes. It also reported that the drop-down search bar was not auto-populating for the account of Jason Kessler, who organized the white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, last August. \nTwitter said, The profiles, Tweets and discussions about accounts with the auto-populate issue do appear when you search for them. To be clear, our behavioral ranking doesnt make judgments based on political views or the substance of Tweets. A Twitter spokesman also said, I'd emphasize that our technology is based on account *behavior* not the content of Tweets.\nIn May, the social media company discussed in a blog post a new approach it was taking to improve the health of the public conversation on Twitter. It said we use policies, human review processes, and machine learning to help us determine how Tweets are organized and presented in communal places like conversations and search. It added, This technology and our team will learn over time and will make mistakes, and that well continue to be open and honest about the mistakes we make and the progress we are making.\nOnline media outlet The Daily Dot reported the Twitter auto-populate issue on Tuesday. That afternoon, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey tweeted, A short thread addressing some issues folks are encountering as a result of our conversational health work, specifically the perception of shadowbanning based on content or ideology. It suffices to say we have a lot more work to do to earn peoples trust on how we work.\nResponses to VICEs article\nOn Wednesday afternoon,Ronna McDaniel tweeted, The notion that social media companies would suppress certain political points of view should concern every American. Twitter owes the public answers to whats really going on. She also tweeted a graphic on Wednesday evening showing that her Twitter account was not appearing in the auto-populated dropdown search box when her name was typed into the search box. She did not specify when the graphic was captured.\nOn Wednesday afternoon, Donald Trump Jr. tweeted, So now @twitter is censoring @GOPChairwoman?, adding, [Jack Dorsey] its time for you to #StopTheBias against conservatives and Trump supporters and fix this once and for all.\nOn Tuesday Gaetz tweeted a link to The Daily Dot article, saying, Hey @Twitter, are you shadow-banning my twitter account?? It would appear so.\nA spokesman for Gaetz said, It is curious that these allegations would arise the week following Congressman Gaetzs heated exchange with Twitter senior executives before the House Judiciary Committee. On July 17, the House Judiciary Committee held a hearing named Facebook, Google and Twitter: Examining the Content Filtering Practices of Social Media Giants. During the hearing, Gaetz questioned a Twitter executive on what the company thought its rights were to designate content on its site.\nHouse Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) told VICE, This type of opaque behavior by social media companies is exactly why conservatives are speaking out and demanding more transparency and accountability. The bias has to stop. \nOn Thursday morning, President Donald Trump tweeted, Twitter SHADOW BANNING prominent Republicans. Not good. We will look into this discriminatory and illegal practice at once! Many complaints.\nTwitters Thursday response\nOn Thursday, Twitter published a blog post saying it did not shadow ban accounts and added, You are always able to see the tweets from accounts you follow (although you may have to do more work to find them, like go directly to their profile). And we certainly dont shadow ban based on political viewpoints or ideology. \nTwitter said Wednesday that it identified an issue where some accounts werent auto-suggested in search even when people were searching for their specific name. It added that as of Wednesday afternoon, this issue was resolved.\nTwitter said the auto-populate issue affected hundreds of thousands of accounts and that the accounts of Democratic politicians were also impacted. The social media company said it believed the issue with accounts of some Republican representatives had more to do with how other people were interacting with these representatives accounts than the accounts themselves. \nIt said, There are communities that try to boost each others presence on the platform through coordinated engagement. We believe these types of actors engaged with the representatives accounts. It said this, combined with Twitters previous criteria for search auto-suggestions, caused the representatives accounts to not show up in auto-suggestions. It said it would work to better detect these situations and correct for them.\nTwitter said it ranks tweets and search results, and that ranking models take many signals into consideration to best organize tweets for timely relevance, adding that it must also address bad-faith actors who intend to manipulate or detract from healthy conversation. It gave an example of a search result having 30,000 tweets, and provided the criteria it would consider in its search ranking, which included that tweets from people youre interested in should rank highly, tweets that are popular should be ranked higher, and tweets from bad-faith actors who intend to manipulate or divide the conversation should be ranked lower. \nThe company provided some signals it uses to determine bad-faith actors:\n\n\tSpecific account properties that indicate authenticity (e.g. whether you have a confirmed email address, how recently your account was created, whether you uploaded a profile image, etc.).\n\tWhat actions you take on Twitter (e.g. who you follow, who you retweet, etc.).\n\tHow other accounts interact with you (e.g. who mutes you, who follows you, who retweets you, who blocks you, etc.)\n\nTwitter said, We know this approach is working because we see fewer abuse reports and spam reports.\nSources: C-SPAN, Fox News, National Review, The Daily Dot, The New York Times, Twitter 1, Twitter 2, VICE News",

      "Content": "The 2018 Nobel Prize in Literature will be postponed until 2019, according to the Swedish Academy, the group responsible for awarding the prize. The group said in a statement on Friday that there have been five occasions in the past when an award has been delayed, and that the group was doing so this time in view of the currently diminished Academy and the reduced public confidence in the Academy. \nThe academy didnt specify in a statement what it meant by diminished or reduced public confidence. In April, six academy members resigned following a vote to remove a member, Katarina Frostenson, for allegedly giving her husband, Jean-Claude Arnault, information about prize winners. Arnault has been accused of sexual assault and harassment, and leaking award information. Arnaults lawyer has said he denies the allegations.\nAccording to a Nobel Foundation press release, an award may be postponed when the decision will not be perceived as credible. The foundation said it presumes that the Swedish Academy will now put all its efforts into the task of restoring its credibility.\nThe academy is only responsible for the literature award. The Nobel Foundation said the groups decision to postpone the prize does not impact the awarding of the 2018 Nobel Prizes in other prize categories.\nThe Academy was founded in 1786. It is made up of 18 members who receive lifetime appointments to the group. Swedish inventor Alfred Nobel appointed the academy in his will to award the the Nobel Prize in Literature. The group began giving out the award in 1901.\nMedia outlets described the following events involving the Academy since last November:\n\n\tIn November of last year, Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter reported that 18 women had made allegations of sexual assault and harassment against Jean-Claude Arnault, a photographer who is married to Katarina Frostenson, an academy member.\n\tHis accusers alleged some incidents of assault took place at properties owned by the academy.\n\tDagens Nyheter also accused Arnault of leaking the names of prize winners ahead of the official announcement. Frostenson allegedly disclosed the information to him.\n\tThe academy held a vote on whether to remove Frostenson from the group, for her alleged disclosure of award information. The vote did not pass.\n\tOn April 6, three members of the academy announced their resignation. Academy member Anders Olsson said he thought main reason they left was because they disagreed with the vote outcome.\n\tThree additional members of the academy resigned the following week, including Permanent Secretary of the academy Sara Danius and Frostenson.\n\tA preliminary investigation into the assault allegations against Arnault is ongoing. Arnaults lawyer has denied the allegations  including that of leaking information  on his behalf.\n\nSources: Associated Press, Nobel Foundation Press Release, Reuters, The New York Times 1, The New York Times 2, Time Magazine",

The largest demonstration reported by AP was in Moscow, where the Federation of Trade Unions said about 120,000 people marched.\nIn France, police said more than 20,000 people marched in Paris demonstrations organized by labor unions. Demonstrators were protesting some of President Emmanuel Macrons proposed labor reforms, which include making it easier for employers to terminate contracts. (Read more here.) A group of more than 1,000 people dressed in black jackets and face masks marched in Paris, with some setting a McDonalds and vehicles on fire. Police used tear gas and a water cannon on someof the Paris protesters.\nIn South Korea, police estimated about 10,000 people demonstrated in Seoul in a rally organized by the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions. Demonstrators called for the government to convert non-regular employees, such as those on fixed-term contracts, part-time employees or day laborers, to regular employees, or full-time employees, who receive more pay and benefits. They also called for a higher minimum wage.\nIn Indonesia, about 10,000 people demonstrated in the capital city of Jakarta, calling for wage increases, a reduction in the number of foreign workers in the country and less outsourcing of labor. \nIn the Philippines, about 5,000 people demonstrated in Manila, calling for the government to raise wages, reduce unemployment, end or reduce some restrictions on trade unions, and stop contractualization of short-term employment. Contractualized workers have fewer benefits than permanent employees.\nIn Spain, there were May Day marches in more than 70 cities, with some calling for gender equality in the workplace, higher salaries and higher pension payments. \nIn Turkey, police detained more than 12 people who were marching toward Istanbuls Taksim Square. Authorities had closed the square to May Day demonstrations, citing security concerns, according to AP. \nIn Greece, there were at least 3 separate May Day demonstrations in Athens, with police estimating more than 7,000 people were present for one organized by a union led by a communist party. \nThe German Confederation of Trade Unions (DGB) said a total of about 340,000 people participated in about 500 May Day events in Germany. About 4,000 people marched in Berlin and 12,000 in Vienna, with some calling attention to welfare reductions and workers conditions, according to AP.\nSources: AFP, AP, BBC, Europe Solidaire Sans Frontires, Export.gov, The Economist",

Hamas has controlled the Gaza strip since a disputed election in 2006 led to an armed conflict the following year.

May called the attack an indiscriminate and reckless act against the United Kingdom, putting the lives of innocent civilians at risk.\" Russia has denied responsibility.\nAccording to May, the U.K.s Porton Down laboratory positively identified the chemical used in the attack as a Novichok nerve agent. She said that Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson had contacted the Russian ambassador, requiring Moscow to provide a \"full and complete disclosure of the Novichok program to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons by the end of Tuesday. (More below)\nRussian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said the incident was another information and political campaign based on provocation. A representative for Russias upper parliaments foreign affairs committee, Vladimir Dzhabarov, said, This already is not our issue, adding that Skripal had access neither to our secrets nor facilities.\nThe nerve agent\nThe group of Novichok chemicals (Russian for newcomer) were produced in the 1970s and 1980s by Soviet Union laboratories. The agents block the breakdown of a neurotransmitter that controls muscular contractions, which leads to respiratory and cardiac arrest, according to Vil Mirzayanov, a chemist who helped develop the chemicals and who spoke to investigators following the breakup of the Soviet Union. \nBBC reported that the agents may come in liquid form, and The New York Times reported the chemicals are powders.\nThe victims\nSergei and Yulia Skripal were found unconscious on a park bench outside a shopping mall in the British town of Salisbury. Sergei Skripal was once a colonel with a Russian military intelligence service. He was jailed in 2006 for providing information to the British intelligence service M16, according to Russian state media accounts of a closed hearing. He was released in 2010 as part of an exchange for Russian spies arrested by the FBI, CNN reported. Both Skripals remain hospitalized in critical condition.\nNearly two dozen people, including emergency workers, were given medical treatment following the poisoning. Detective Sergeant Nick Bailey, who came into contact with the nerve agent, was hospitalized and remains in serious condition. He has been able to speak with visitors, according to CNN.\nUpdate: On Wednesday, May said Britain would expel 23 Russian diplomats in response to the attack, saying it represented \"an unlawful use of force by the Russian state against the United Kingdom.\nWatch Prime Minister Mays speech here.\nSources: BBC, CNN, The Guardian, The New York Times",

      "Content": "On Monday, the Saudi Arabian-led coalition fighting in Yemen said Iran was partially responsible for a missile launched at the Saudi capital of Riyadh on Saturday. Yemeni Houthi rebels claimed responsibility for Saturdays missile aimed at the Riyadh airport, and which Saudi forces shot down. The Houthis are at war with a Saudi-led coalition, which supports the overthrown Yemen government. \n\nThe Saudi coalition accused Iran of providing the missile to the Houthis, saying the act constitutes a clear act of aggression and that it could rise to be considered as an act of war against Saudi Arabia. Iran, which supports the Houthis politically, denied it was involved in Saturdays attack.\nSaudi Arabias Civil Aviation Authority said the intercepted missile, which left fragments in uninhabited land, did not cause damage to the airport. Colonel Turki al-Maliki, cited by Saudi news network SPA, said the missile was fired from within the Yemeni border at 8:07 p.m. local time, and was destroyed with a surface-to-air Patriot missile. Maliki said there were no reported casualties. On Monday, Saudi Arabia temporarily closed down land borders and air and sea ports to Yemen, which is about 620 miles (1,000 km) from Riyadh.\nThe Houthi rebels claimed responsibility for the attack, citing Saudi Arabian aggression in the form of airstrikes and civilian casualties. The capital cities of countries that continually shell us, targeting innocent civilians, will not be spared from our missiles, a spokesperson for the rebels said on Saturday. The Houthis said they locally produced their Volcano-variant ballistic missile.\nLast week, an airstrike in Yemen that was suspected to be carried out by the Saudi-led coalition killed at least 29 people. \nThe Saudi-led coalition statement on Monday said examination of the missile debris confirmed the role of Irans regime in manufacturing [this and a previous missile] and smuggling them to the Houthi militias in Yemen for the purpose of attacking the Kingdom, its people, and vital interests. The coalition said Iran was violating a U.N. Security Council resolution that prohibits the sale of weapons to Yemeni armed groups.\nThe coalition also said Iran had direct command of the Houthis and that Saudi Arabia reserves its right to respond to Iran in the appropriate time and manner.\nWar in Yemen\nThe Yemeni civil war began in March 2015, when Houthi rebels overthrew President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadis government in the Yemeni capital of Sanaa. Saudi Arabia then led a coalition of Sunni Arab states to fight the Houthis and attempt to reinstate Hadis internationally-recognized government, which reportedly retains control of the city of Aden, The Associated Press reported. The U.S. is an ally of Saudi Arabia, a Sunni Muslim nation. Iran, a Shiite Muslim nation, says it politically supports the Houthi rebels, who are also Shiite, but denies arming them.\nThe war has killed more than 10,000 people, injured at least 40,000, and displaced 3 million others. Most of the deaths have been from Saudi coalition airstrikes, according to Al Jazeera.",

      "Content": "China announced on Friday that it would instantly impose tariffs on $60 billion worth of U.S. products if the U.S. moves forward with a proposal to implement tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods. The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) began reviewing that proposal at the request of President Donald Trump. The plan is currently in a public comment period until Aug. 30. \nThe announced Chinese plan would apply tariffs to 5,207 different U.S. products in four rate categories, Chinas Customs Tariff Commission of the State Council announced. The rates would be 5, 10, 20 and 25 percent, on products including alcoholic drinks, auto parts, coffee, furniture, liquified natural gas, leather products, machinery, meat, minerals, nuts, and wood products. The commission said China was forced to take the countermeasures because of the U.S. tariffs. \nThe United States violated consensuses reached by multiple bilateral negotiations and once again unilaterally escalated trade frictions, the commission said. If the United States acts willfully and puts its additional tariff measures into effect, China will instantly implement such tariff measures. China also alleged that the U.S. violated World Trade Organization rules and damaged free trade and Chinese interests.\nTrump has said the tariffs against China are necessary because of the trade deficit the U.S. has with the country. White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement on Friday that China should address the longstanding concerns about its unfair trading practices, instead of retaliating.\nBackground\nIn June, Trump directed the USTR to create a list of Chinese products that the U.S. could apply a 10 percent tariff on, in case China retaliated against the U.S. for 25 percent tariffs it implemented on $34 billion worth of Chinese imports on July 6. China then did impose retaliatory tariffs on the same amount of U.S. goods.\nOn July 10, the USTR released a list of $200 billion worth of products for a potential 10 percent tariff. Then last week, the White House directed the USTR to plan to increase the proposed tariffs to 25 percent, from 10 percent, for the $200 billion of products. \nU.S. tariffs are being implemented under section 301 of the U.S. Trade Act of 1974, which allows the president to take action against unfair or discriminatory trade practices, or trade agreement violations. A USTR section 301 investigation concluded that the acts, policies, and practices of the Government of China related to technology transfer, intellectual property, and innovation covered in the investigation are unreasonable or discriminatory and burden or restrict U.S. commerce. \nOn July 11, the U.S. Senate passed a non-binding resolution in a 88 to 11 vote calling on Trump to obtain congressional approval prior to using national security concerns as a justification for imposing tariffs on other countries.\nUS-China trade relations\nThe U.S. and China have the largest trading relationship of any two countries, annually exchanging about $635 billion worth of goods in 2017, according to U.S. government figures. That year, the U.S. had a goods trade deficit of $375 billion with China, meaning that the value of goods the U.S. purchased from China was that much higher than the value of the goods China bought from the U.S. \nOf all the goods the U.S. imports, 18 percent come from China, and of all the goods the U.S. exports, 8 percent are bought by China, according to U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis 2016 statistics. \n\nSources: CNN, CNN, The White House, USTR Proposal, Xinhua (English)",

      "Content": "On Thursday, U.S. President Donald Trump reportedly used vulgar language during a meeting with lawmakers, in which Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) presented proposed legislation on immigration. After discussing possible immigration from Haiti and African nations, anonymous sources said Trump asked, Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here? On Friday, Trump tweeted that his words at the meeting were tough, but this was not the language used. \nThe Washington Post, which broke the story, said Trump was told the proposal would benefit Haitians, to which he reportedly responded, Why do we need more Haitians? Take them out. Trump also tweeted Friday that he never said anything derogatory about Haitians other than Haiti is, obviously, a very poor and troubled country. Never said take them out.\nMSNBC reported that Durbin said of the presidents tweet that denied the language used, It is not true. He said these hate-filled things, and he said them repeatedly.\" Graham said he told Trump at the time how he felt about his comments. Reps. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and Robert W. Goodlatte (R.-Va.), and Sens. David Perdue (R.-Ga.) and Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) also attended the meeting. Cotton and Perdue said they could not recall specifically the language Trump had used.\nWhite House Deputy Press Secretary Raj Shah issued a statement Thursday that did not address or deny Trumps comments. He said, Like other nations that have merit-based immigration, President Trump is fighting for permanent solutions that make our country stronger by welcoming those who can contribute to our society, grow our economy and assimilate into our great nation. \nAmong other items detailed below, the bipartisan proposal included the legal status revision of about 800,000 undocumented immigrants who entered the U.S. as children, so-called Dreamers. In September, U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program that granted work authorizations and deferred deportation for dreamers was being rescinded, with no new work permits to be issued after Mar. 5, 2018. \nDACA was established by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in June 2012, during the Obama administration. After the announcement of an end to DACA, Trump said it was now time for Congress to act on the issue.\nA judge in California ruled last week that DACA would continue past the March deadline while litigation continued against the Trump administrations decision to rescind the program. The ruling requires DHS to process work permit renewals, but it does not require the department to accept new applicants.\nTrump reportedly said at the Thursday meeting that he would be receptive to proposals that allow more immigrants from Asian countries because he thinks they would benefit the U.S. economy. Trump also reportedly said the U.S. should admit more people from countries such as Norway. The president had met with Norways prime minister the day before.\nAbout the bipartisan proposal\nThursdays proposal included over $2.5 billion for border security and protected status for parents of DACA recipients, who would not be allowed to sponsor their parents for U.S. citizenship, The New York Times reported. The plan also reportedly included stopping the current version of the diversity visa lottery program that issues approximately 50,000 visas per year and allocating about half of those visas to immigrants with Temporary Protected Status (TPS). The proposal also included reinstating TPS protections for some countries that have been removed from the program, such as last weeks removal of El Salvador, and $1.5 billion to fund a border wall, according to The Washington Post. \nThe White House had released remarks from a Tuesday meeting in which Trump mentioned three vital goals for any DACA legislation: 1) a border wall and measures to close enforcement loopholes, 2) ending so-called chain migration and 3) ending the visa lottery program. On Tuesday of last week, Trump tweeted that a border wall with Mexico, one of his campaign promises, must be part of any DACA approval.\nSources: The New York Times, The Washington Post",

Russian state-owned news outlet TASS cited Dmitry Peskov, spokesman for Russian President Vladimir Putin, saying Facebooks decision is a form of censorship towards Russian media. \nIn February, U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller indicted the IRA, two other companies and 13 Russian nationals for alleged interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Russia asked for an explanation of Facebooks decision from the U.S. State Department. \nOn Tuesday, Facebook said it had removed 70 Facebook accounts, 138 Facebook pages and 65 Instagram accounts that it said were controlled by the IRA. Facebook owns Instagram. Facebook stated 95 percent of the pages it removed had content in Russian and that many of the pages ran ads, all of which have been removed. \nFacebook said it removed the pages based on their association with the IRA, not based on their content. The company said, the IRA has consistently used inauthentic accounts to deceive and manipulate people. Facebook added that it did not want the IRA on its site, and that it would remove every account it finds with links to the IRA.\nThe statement from Facebook said about 1.1 million unique users followed at least one of the Facebook pages it removed; about 488,000 of them were from Russia and 170,000 from Ukraine. The pages also included followers from other countries, including at least 18,000 users from each of the following countries: Brazil, Georgia, Krygyzstan, Turkey, Azerbaijan, Kasakhstan, Uzbekistan and Moldova. \nRussian news outlet RT reported that pages of the Russian Federal News Agency and the Moscow mayors economic development office were among those removed.\nMaria Zakharova, spokesperson for Russias Foreign Ministry, said: It is clear that this is part of the anti-Russian campaign in which the media landscape is being cleansed of alternative sources of information, under the pretext of Russian interference in the 2016 election. She referred to the account removal as totalitarian methods of control and censorship. \nSources: Facebook, NPR, RT, TASS",

Security Council has required North Korea to cease export of arms and related material as well as items relevant to nuclear, ballistic missiles and other weapons of mass destruction-related programs. In 2010, the council mandated that a panel of eight experts to investigate and report possible sanction violations by North Korea. That panel reportedly drafted the document cited by the Times.\nIn 2013, two years into the Syrian civil war, the Obama administration alleged that the Syrian government had used sarin gas in Ghouta.

      "Content": "After a fire destroyed sections of the 200-year-old National Museum in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on Sunday evening, the museum issued a statement Monday saying that prior to the fire it was in the process of modernizing the facility. The plans included an upgrade to the museums fire prevention system, and negotiations for the upgrade started in 2015, the museum said in a statement. It reported no casualties from the fire. \nPart of the citys Federal University, the museum housed Egyptian and Greco-Roman artifacts, a 12,000 year-old skeleton, fossils, dinosaurs, and a meteorite found in 1784, among other exhibits. The building was formerly a royal palace and was converted to a museum 200 years ago.\nThe fire started around 7:20 p.m. local time Sunday after the museum had closed. Much of its archive of 20 million items is believed to have been destroyed, The Guardian reported. \nThe fires cause has not yet been determined; the museum called for federal police to investigate the rapid propagation of the flames.\nThe museums statement called for a change in the way the government funds federal universities and suggested it had been trying to attain funding for upgrades to the building for several years. \nThis devastating moment should be an alert for the country's democratic forces, in the sense of preserving the nation's cultural heritage, a translated version of the statement said. The inadmissible event that affected the National Museum of UFRJ [Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro] has clearly identifiable causes. It is a country project that reduces our memory to the ashes. We would like Brazilian society to join the university and scientific community to help change the treatment of education, memory, culture and science in Brazil.\nOn Sunday, Brazilian President Michel Temer tweeted about the fire, calling the loss of the museum's collection unforgettable. Temer noted, in Portuguese, that 200 years of work, research and knowledge have been lost. The value of our history can not be measured by the damage to the building that housed the royal family during the Empire. It's a sad day for all Brazilians.\n",

      "Content": "In their coverage of Chinas proposed constitutional change, some Western media outlets suggested the move would allow President Xi Jinping to stay in office indefinitely and could lead to more authoritarian rule. Many outlets didnt include much about Chinese public opinion regarding the move. Access to such information may be curtailed by internet censorship and limited press freedom, but we searched Chinese media outlets, search engines and social media on the day of the announcement to see what we could find. \nChinese media coverage\nChinas state-run Xinhua news agency covered the announcement on its English- and Chinese-language sites, as did the English-language version of Chinas Global Times. None of the outlets discussed the possible effects the change in policy might have on the countrys leadership. Here is the extent of the announcement as it appeared on Xinhuas English-language site. Note: this was the eighth point in a list of 11 possible policy changes announced within the same article.\n\n-- Chinese President and Vice-President\nThe [CCP] Central Committee proposed revising the clause The term of office of the President and Vice-President of the Peoples Republic of China is the same as that of the National Peoples Congress, and they shall serve no more than two consecutive terms to The term of office of the President and Vice-President of the Peoples Republic of China is the same as that of the National Peoples Congress.\n\nSearch results in China\nOn the day of the announcement, western and Chinese search engine results indicated Chinese-language media outlets either briefly mentioned the policy change (as noted above), along with other proposed changes, or they did not include the information at all. Heres a snapshot of search results from four of Chinas most frequented sites or portals.\n\n\tSINA displayed one article titled, Cadres and the masses firmly support the [CCP] Central Committee to amend part of the Constitution. The article didnt list specific changes relating to presidential terms.\n\tWANGYI displayed one article titled, The great significance of Carrying the Socialist Thoughts with Chinese Characteristics in the New Era of Xi Jinping into the Constitution. The article also didnt contain specifics about the term changes. \n\tSOHU featured the same article as Xinhua. This change to presidential terms was listed as 14th out of 21 points, and it was bolded. However, the article was positioned in the finance and stock market sidebar on the sites home page. \n\tQQ also featured the same article as Xinhua and, as in SOHU, it listed the point in question as 14 out of a total of 21 points.\n\nThe exposure the announcement reportedly had in Chinese media may have contributed to public opinion being limited on the matter. Search results may also have been impacted by limited press freedom. For instance, Reporters Without Borders ranked China 176 out of 180 countries in its 2016 worldwide index of press freedom. For more on media censorship in China, see this Council on Foreign Relations report.\nSocial media\nReuters reported that though positive remarks filled the comments section under the pages of main state media outlets like the Peoples Daily, the move was not welcomed by everyone on Chinas Twitter-like Weibo service. The outlet cited one such opinion from a Weibo user: If two terms are not enough, then they can write in a third term, but there needs to be a limit. Getting rid of it is not good!\nSome articles on the aforementioned Chinese portals allowed user comments. On the day of the announcement, we reviewed the available comments on the following portals: 25 comments on SINA, 11,877 on QQ and 554 on WANGYI. We briefly reviewed other online forums as well. No comments voicing opposition to the proposed constitutional changes were found in our sample. \nMany of the comments we reviewed were similarly worded. Here are a few such examples from one online forum under Topic: Proposal of the CPC Central Committee on Revising Part of the Constitution.\n\n\tResolutely support the resolution of the Party Central Committee.\n\tResolutely support the resolution of the Party Central Committee. Amending the constitution is the most solid step in realizing the Chinese dream. In order to actualize the Chinese dream, [let's] work hard. Come on!\n\tAmending the constitution is a step toward realizing the Chinese dream. We resolutely support the resolutions of the Party Central Committee. In order to actualize the Chinese dream, [lets] roll up our sleeves and do it. Come on!!!\n\tEvery amendment to the constitution is to enrich and perfect the rights of the Chinese people. Both are the result of the Party Central Committee and the government conforming to public opinions and respecting public opinion, and they uphold their support. [I] support and praise [it].\n\nThe above comments, and the lack of comments voicing disapproval, may have been influenced by the governments monitoring of social media platforms in China. Given the limitations in data, its difficult to determine whether Chinese citizens agree or disagree with the constitutional change to term limits. We did obtain data from the China-based family and associates of one of our media analysts. Although not an indicator of overall opinion, the individuals we surveyed appeared to either not have an opinion on the issue, or expressed support for Xis leadership.\nPublic opinion on Xi Jinping\nWe were unable to locate Chinese opinion polls on Xi or the constitutional changes. At least one U.S.-based poll has published his, and other world leaders, overall public support.\nA 2014 study conducted by Harvard Universitys Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation showed majority public support for Xis policies. (Note: the report did not include its methodology). When asked about domestic and international affairs, 94.8 percent and 93.8 percent of Chinese respondents, respectively, had confidence in Xis handling of those issues. When ranked on a 10-point scale, with 10 being the best, his citizens gave him an average score of 9. Regarding these points, the studys researchers noted:\n\nWe see a clear correlation between political systems and the ratings of their own leaders by the respondents. In countries where discussion of leaders is more constrained, the national leaders rate very highly.\n\nWhen compared with the ratings of nine other world leaders, Xis was the highest. Russian President Vladimir Putin, who scored an 8.7 out of 10, came in second. The study also noted that citizens in countries with two or more dominant political parties are more critical of their national leaders and policies, compared to nations where politics are less contested.",

The rebel group denied targeting the residential area. The Observatory also said shell attacks on the city of Damascus killed four people on Friday. State media said the rebels were responsible for the Damascus shelling. \nSyrian President Bashar al-Assads forces began an offensive against rebel groups in eastern Ghouta, where Douma is located, in February. More than 1,600 civilians have been killed since then, according to the Observatory. \nAssads forces and Jaish al-Islam began negotiations ten days ago.

U.S. President Donald Trump announced in May that the U.S. would withdraw from the agreement, formally called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said Iran could remain in the agreement if the other non-American signatories guaranteed his countrys interests.\nEU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini chaired the three hours of talks, before delivering a joint statement from the participants following the meeting. Participants agreed to keep progress under close review and to reconvene the joint commission, including at ministerial level, as appropriate in order to advance common efforts, Mogherini said. \nZarif said Irans concerns were addressed in the meeting. More details were disclosed, he said. And they make us more optimistic than we were yesterday. He told reporters that the proposed changes to the agreement were not precise or complete, adding that it would be up to the leadership in Tehran to decide whether Iran should remain in the deal. \nThe JCPOA \nThe JCPOA, which was adopted in 2015 after 18 months of negotiations, was signed by Iran and six other nations: the U.S., Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany. The agreement required Iran to give up about 98 percent of its enriched uranium, prohibited the country from producing nuclear weapons, and required it to allow nuclear inspections. \nUnder the terms of the deal, Iran confirmed that under no circumstances would it seek, develop or acquire any nuclear weapons. In exchange for agreeing to the restrictions, the U.S., European Union and other members of the United Nations lifted some sanctions on oil and other products from Iran.\nOn Jul. 20, 2015, the United Nations Security Council adopted Resolution 2231, endorsing the JCPOA.\nSome requirements of the deal, such as limits on its uranium stores, are scheduled to expire between 2025 and 2031 under various sunset clauses (or scheduled termination of certain provisions). Prior to the U.S. withdrawal, Trump criticized what he called flaws in the deal, including insufficient enforcement and the existence of the sunset clauses.\nMore information on JCPOA is available here.\nA timeline of Irans nuclear program is available here.\nSources: AP, Reuters",

      "Content": "On Wednesday, the U.S. State Department said it had evacuated several staffers from its consulate in Guangzhou, China, and sent them to the U.S. for further evaluation and a comprehensive assessment of their symptoms and findings. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo set up a task force last month to investigate reports of damage to staffers hearing, memory and vision. Neither China nor the U.S. have said they have determined a cause for the symptoms.\nOn Tuesday, Pompeo announced he had set up the task force on May 23. He said in a statement, At this time, 24 U.S. government personnel and family members who served in Cuba have been medically-confirmed as having symptoms and clinical findings similar to those [that are] noted following [a] concussion or minor traumatic brain injury. He added that on May 16, a consulate staffer in China was medically-confirmed with similar findings. The precise nature of the injuries suffered by the affected personnel, and whether a common cause exists for all cases, has not yet been established.\nPompeo said, Reported symptoms have included dizziness, headaches, tinnitus, fatigue, cognitive issues, visual problems, ear complaints and hearing loss, and difficulty sleeping.\nOn May 23, the U.S. Embassy and Consulates in China issued a health alert saying, A U.S. government employee in China recently reported subtle and vague, but abnormal, sensations of sound and pressure.  At the time it said it did not know what caused the symptoms and was not aware of any similar situations in China, either inside or outside of the diplomatic community.\nOn Thursday, China said it had investigated and could not determine a cause for the described symptoms, according to NPR. The Chinese foreign ministry said it would conduct further investigations if requested by the U.S., and that it took its obligation to protect foreign diplomats seriously.\nState Department spokesperson Heather Nauert said medical screenings of employees continue. Evacuated staff members have been tested at the University of Pennsylvania, where staff from Cuba had also been tested, according to The Associated Press.\nLast September, the U.S. reduced its embassy personnel in Cuba by more than half to minimize the number of diplomats at risk of exposure to harm, then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said. The U.S. later expelled 15 Cuban diplomats. Possible causes for the symptoms experienced by U.S. employees in Cuba were a sonic device, toxins or a virus, The New York Times reported. Cuba denied involvement in the reported medical issues. \nThe U.S. has an embassy in Beijing and four consulates in China, in addition to the one in Guangzhou. Nauert said there are about 170 diplomats, employees and their families associated with the Guangzhou consulate.\nSources: NBC News, NPR, The New York Times",

Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter, Yulia, 33, were in critical condition after being found unconscious on a park bench in Salisbury on Sunday. A policeman who responded to the scene was in serious condition. Skripal was a former colonel in GRU, a Russian military intelligence service. \nRowley said scientists had identified the nerve agent; he did not name the specific compound or how it may have been administered. Police said the Skripals had become unwell at about 1:30 p.m. local time, and that a passerby called police at about 4:15 p.m.\nThe park bench as well as a restaurant and pub in the area remained cordoned off by authorities.\nIn 2004, Russian authorities arrested Skripal for providing the British intelligence service MI6 with the names of Russian agents. He was sentenced to 13 years in prison in 2006. He was released and moved to the U.K. four years later as part of an exchange for Russian spies arrested by the FBI.\nSources: BBC, Reuters",

      "Content": "What is the European migration crisis?\nEuropean Union countries have been experiencing higher numbers of migrants seeking asylum over the past few years  a trend often referred to as the immigration crisis or migrant crisis. More than 1.7 million such migrants have arrived in the EU since 2014, most of them fleeing the Syrian conflict, while others come from Africa, other parts of the Middle East and other areas.\nRoughly 30 percent of migrants were children in 2015 and 2016, including those unaccompanied by an adult, according to the European Commission.\nThe European Commission reported that most migrants are trying to escape from political oppression, war and poverty, as well as to reunite with family and benefit from entrepreneurship and education. The latter group (those seeking entrepreneurship and education) is referred to economic migrants. This type of migrant is not eligible for asylum, according to the European Commission.\nAsylum seekers are people fleeing conflict or persecution and seeking protections outlined in the 1951 Refugee Convention on the Status of Refugees, which was ratified by 145 United Nations member states. A refugee is an asylum seeker whose asylum claim has already been approved.\nWhere do the migrants arrive?\nMost of the migrants enter the EU in Greece and Italy, followed by Spain. An EU law, the 2013 Dublin Regulation, stipulates that migrants seeking refugee status must apply for asylum in the country where they first enter Europe and remain in that country for the asylum process. Under the law, the countries of arrival are legally responsible for reviewing the asylum claims, and either granting the claim or determining that migrants need to return to their countries of origin.\nRefugees who have been approved to live in the EU are sometimes relocated to member states other than their country of arrival. This decision is based in part on criteria established by the Dublin Regulation that determine when a country is receiving a disproportionate number of asylum applications based on its relative size and wealth.\nHow many asylum seekers are coming to the EU?\nMigration to Europe reached its peak in 2015, with 1,015,078 migrants recorded as arriving in the EU to seek asylum this year, the majority of whom were smuggled from Turkey to Greece by sea. (These figures do not include migration from other EU member states or other types of legal migration.) \nThe number of new migrants has declined since 2015. According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), 362,000 migrants crossed the Mediterranean Sea in 2016: 181,400 arrived in Italy and 173,450 in Greece.\nLast year, the total figure of migrants newly entering Europe was about 105,000. (See below for measures the EU has taken to reduce migration.) \nAccording to the European Migration Network, a total 709,200 asylum applications were filed in the EU plus Norway in 2017. This was 43 percent fewer than the previous year.\nFrom January to mid-September 2018, just over 76,000 migrants seeking asylum arrived in the EU, according to UNHCR figures.\nThere are also estimated to be hundreds of thousands of undocumented migrants in Europe.\nWhats the problem?\nWhile the European Union maintains that it has a legal and moral obligation to protect asylum seekers who have a legitimate claim for protection, the increased migration has placed an economic burden on EU countries. Between 2015 and 2017, the EU allocated about $20.6 billion (17.7 billion) of its budget to address migration, including funding for projects outside of the EU and humanitarian aid. (The EUs total annual budget in 2015 was $170.8 billion, or 145 billion.)\nIndividual countries also spend large sums on the migrant situation, including on border improvement. For example, Germany spent about $26.7 billion (23 billion) on migration in 2016, according to Johannes Singhammer, the vice president of the German parliament at the time.\nA EU member state can choose not to accept a refugee who has been granted asylum and whom it would otherwise need to accept under the Dublin Regulation. The country can instead choose to reallocate the migrant to another EU state, but this will cost the country money. In accordance with the regulation, the country is obligated to contribute 250,000 for each such applicant.\nAdditionally, migrants go through dangerous and sometimes deadly situations to reach the EU. The European Commission reported that as much as 90 percent of migrants hired human smugglers. Thousands of migrants have died while trying to reach Europe by sea. In 2015, the year with the highest levels of migration, a recorded 3,771 migrants died or went missing while trying to reach Europe by sea, according to figures from the International Organization for Migration (IOM).\nMigrants who arrive and seek asylum are sometimes held in detention centers. Activist groups have accused some of these centers of violating the European Convention on Human Rights provisions that prohibit inhumane and degrading treatment.\nWhat has the EU done to address the situation?\nThe EU has taken measures to try to address the migrant situation in multiple areas, within the union and outside of it.\nIn May 2015, EU leaders drafted A European Agenda on Migration, which outlined commitments for EU countries to take certain numbers of refugees. It also outlined other projects, such as stopping human smugglers, increasing border security, and simplifying the asylum process.\nAt sea, EU countries have increased the presence of ships in the Mediterranean to stop migrant trafficking networks and rescue migrants from drowning. Between 2015 and 2017, the EU caught 2,000 traffickers and 375 trafficking vessels, according to the European Commission. The EU has also deployed more border guards to the borders of member states.\nThe EUs agenda on migration has also included a plan to give development assistance to countries from which many of the migrants originate. For example, the EU is providing funding for self-employment opportunities in Niger aimed at reducing economic hardship that encourages migration through the Sahara to Europe.\nThe EU, in 2015, also outlined temporary quotas for the number of refugees each member state must accept. Some member states, such as Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic refused to accept the quotas. Other states have not met their requirements. \nHave EU countries done anything else?\nIndividual member countries have also created laws and policies to address migration. For example, in 2002, Italy passed a law that made illegal immigration and helping migrants enter the country illegally punishable by fines or jail time.\nHungary passed an emergency measure in 2015 that had similar aims, then in 2018 passed a law that that made facilitating illegal immigration, punishable by a year in jail. Hungary has also termed asylum seekers illegal immigrants, and the law applies to them. The law, which affects non-governmental organization workers, also made the grounds for applying for asylum more restrictive. In 2015, 177,000 migrants sought asylum in Hungary, and the country accepted a few hundred of the applications.\nThe U.N.s Declaration of Universal Human Rights states, in Article 14(1), Everyone has the right to seek and to enjoy in other countries asylum from persecution.\n\nSources: BBC, BBC, CFR, EMN 2017 Migration Report, EU Migration Crisis Collection, EU Immigration Report, Europa - Budget, European Commission Child Migration, European Commission Migration, European Commission Migration Agenda, Dublin Regulation, IOM Fatalities, Reuters, UN Declaration, UNHCR, UNHCR, UN Refugee Convention, Welt",

      "Content": "Hundreds of people demonstrated in the the Siberian city of Kemerovo on Tuesday, calling for an investigation into a shopping mall fire that killed at least 64 people, including 41 children. Some demonstrators suggested the death toll was inaccurate, and requested that the Forensic Examiner's Office verify the number, Russian state news agency Tass reported. According to investigators, DNA tests may be required to identify some victims.\nRussian news outlet Novorossia Today described the fire, which occurred on Sunday, as one of the deadliest in Russias post-Soviet history. Russian President Vladimir Putin declared Wednesday a national day of mourning.\nPutin attributed the fire to criminal negligence, and noted that it is not right to apportion blame right away. Russian investigators said the mall's fire exits were blocked and an alarm system was turned off. Everyone will be checked one by one, from those who issued licenses to those who were supposed to ensure safety, Putin said. \nThe origin of the fire has not been determined. Senior regional official Vladimir Chernov said the fire may have started in the children's trampoline room. The preliminary suspicion is that a child had a cigarette lighter which ignited foam rubber in this trampoline room, and it erupted like gunpowder, he said. According to CNN, a preliminary investigation suggested that the fire may have started outside the movie theater. \nAuthorities said they detained five people on charges relating to the deaths and safety violations.\nThe fire occurred at the Winter Cherry shopping mall in Kemerovo on Sunday. Originally a candy factory, the 23,000-square-meter space was converted to a shopping mall in 2013. According to state-run TV, the mall included a bowling alley, a children's center, a movie theater and a petting zoo. All petting zoo animals also died during the fire, according to BBC. \nSources: CNN, BBC",

Kabul police said three men armed with guns and mortars broke into a building behind the Eid Gah Mosque and first fired mortars towards the palace, BBC reported. The Islamic State (IS) claimed responsibility for the mortar attack, according to The Associated Press. The groups claim has not been independently verified. \nAt least 10 explosions occurred during Ghanis speech, BBC reported.\nThe rockets reportedly landed in two areas of the capital city: near the presidential palace and an area near a NATO building and the U.S. embassy, police official Jan Agha confirmed. Kabul police reported that there were no injuries from the initial mortar blasts.\nAccording to Kabul police spokesman Hashmat Stanekzai, authorities tracked down the location where the rockets were suspected to have been launched by following a suspicious vehicle to a mud-brick house near the Eid Gah mosque. Once authorities identified the target, an armed helicopter bombed the location, destroying the house and the vehicle, AP reported.\nSecurity forces exchanged gunfire at the building from where the militants launched their attack, BBC reported. Six people, including at least two members of the Afghan security forces, were wounded during the shooting. Interior Ministry spokesman Najib Danish said all the attackers were killed. \nTwo days prior, Ghani had requested a ceasefire with the Taliban ahead of the Muslim holiday that, if agreed upon, would have lasted until Nov. 21. The Taliban rejected Ghanis request on Monday, according to BBC.\n\nSources: AP, AFP, BBC",

Women may now obtain licenses after taking a drivers test, and, in accordance with the culture, can drive with the approval of a male guardian, The Associated Press reported. Prior to lifting the ban, women could not obtain a drivers license and police enforced the ban on them driving. \nThere are four womens driving schools in the country and two more licensed to open soon, according to the Interior Ministry. The classes, which started to be offered to women three months ago, cost hundreds of dollars and the waitlist for them is months long, AP reported.

Mens classes are less expensive, according to AP.\nCrown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, 32, assumed rule in Saudi Arabia about a year ago and introduced various reforms. They include reducing restrictions on what women can do in public, such as removing a ban on women attending movies or concerts with men. In September 2017, Saudi Arabia announced the plan to lift the ban on women driving via a royal decree announced on national television. At the time, it was the only country in the world that prohibited women from driving, Bloomberg reported. \nRights groups had advocated for the overturn beginning in 1990, and some women have been arrested and jailed for driving, The New York Times reported.\nSome in the kingdom had expressed concern that allowing women to drive could lead to harassment, AP reported. Before lifting the driving ban, Saudi Arabia passed a law against sexual harassment, with sentences of up to five years for the worst offenses, according to AP.\nSaudi Arabia legally enforces a system of male guardianship, under which a woman has a male guardian such as her husband, father, brother or older son. Under Saudi Arabian laws, consent from a womans guardian is required for activities including traveling abroad, marriage and receiving certain medical procedures. AP reported that a guardians approval will not be legally required to obtain a drivers license, though culturally it will be needed to drive. \nSaudi Arabias senior council of clerics said on Sunday it was religiously permissible for women to drive and in the interests of the country.\nSources: AP, Bloomberg, NPR, The New York Times",

      "Content": "Laura Ingraham, host of The Ingraham Angle on Fox News, tweeted an apology to David Hogg on Thursday after she had tweeted the day before that Hogg was rejected by four colleges and whine[d] about it. Hogg is a senior at the high school in Parkland, Florida, where a gunman killed 17 on Feb. 14. After Ingrahams Wednesday tweet, Hogg tweeted a list of 12 companies he referred to as top Laura Ingraham advertisers, and called on his Twitter followers to contact those companies to encourage them to stop advertising.\nAt least three of the companies on Hoggs list later announced they would stop advertising on Ingrahams Fox News show: Nutrish (a pet food brand owned by Rachael Ray), TripAdvisor and online home goods retailer Wayfair.\nThe three aforementioned companies issued statements about their decisions. Nutrish said Ingrahams comments were not consistent with how we feel people should be treated. TripAdvisor said, In our view, these statements focused on a high school student, cross the line of decency. Wayfair said Ingrahams comments were not consistent with our values.\nOn Wednesday, Ingraham tweeted a Daily Wire article that quoted Hogg, 17, as saying he had been not been accepted by four University of California schools about two weeks ago. In an interview with TMZ, Hogg said, It's been kind of annoying having to deal with that and everything else that's been going on but at this point, you know, we're changing the world. We're too busy. Right now it's hard to focus on that. Hogg said he had been accepted by three universities. He has a 4.2 GPA.\nIngraham also hosts a morning talk show on Talk 1370 AM in Austin, Texas. After Hogg tweeted his list of some companies that advertise on Ingrahams shows, Ingraham tweeted a response on Thursday. Her tweets said, I apologize for any upset or hurt my tweet caused [Hogg] or any of the brave victims of Parkland, adding that hes welcome to return to the show anytime for a productive discussion.\nHogg responded with a tweet that included that he would only accept Ingrahams apology if she denounce[d] the way her network had treated his friends and him in this fight.\nHogg was one of the student organizers and speakers at Saturdays March for Our Lives demonstration. He has tweeted criticism of the National Rifle Association (NRA), including saying that people at the NRA scare and manipulate politicians far more than anyone. Hogg has also said, 99.9 percent of the people that are in the NRA are responsible, safe gun owners and I respect them for that, joining an organization that wants to support safe gun ownership is excellent. He added, What were arguing against here are the people that are at the top.\nThe New York Times said Hogg was considering taking a year off from school to, in the newspapers words, focus on midterm elections.\nIngraham has 2.16 million followers on Twitter, and Hogg has about 630,000.\nSources: Breitbart, CNN, Daily Caller, HuffPost, The New York Times",

During his 80-minute speech, Trump discussed infrastructure investment, immigration and foreign affairs. He also spoke about the tax legislation passed in December, lower unemployment rates and efforts to defeat the Islamic State.\nTrump said his administration had met with Democrats and Republicans recently to collaborate on immigration reform. He also reviewed his plan to offer a path to citizenship for 1.8 million illegal immigrants who were brought here by their parents at a young age, also known as Dreamers. The plan also calls for funding a border wall, ending the visa lottery and limiting family-sponsored immigration.\nOn foreign affairs, Trump said North Koreas nuclear missile program could soon threaten the United States, and asked Congress to remove budget caps and increase military spending. We must modernize and rebuild our nuclear arsenal, hopefully never having to use it, Trump said.\nAs for potential initiatives in 2018, Trump called on Congress to produce a bill that generates at least $1.5 trillion for the new infrastructure investment we need.\nRegarding tax cuts in the recently passed legislation, Trump said a typical family of four making $75,000 will see their tax bill reduced by $2,000. He also said unemployment rates were at a 45-year low, with African-American unemployment at its lowest level ever recorded.\nIn his speech, Trump also reported efforts to defeat the Islamic State had liberated almost 100 percent of the territory once held by the group in Iraq and Syria.\nFor a transcript of the full speech, click here.\nSources: AP, Fox News",

      "Content": "Politico and The New York Times reported on Saturday that the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) operated a program to investigate unidentified flying objects (UFOs) from 2007 to 2012. The Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP) was started by then-senator Harry Reid (D-NV). The DOD reportedly spent more than $20 million on the program. A spokesperson for the DOD said the program was ended in 2012, citing other, higher priority issues that merited funding.\nReid said he started the program with the late Senators Daniel Inouye (D-Hi) and Ted Stevens (R-Ala.). Reid, now retired, was the Democratic Senate majority leader at the time. He said Stevens told him that while a pilot during World War II, he had been followed for some miles by an aircraft with no known origin.\nPolitico reported that an anonymous former congressional staffer said the program may have in part been created to determine if China or Russia had developed technologies that could threaten the U.S.\nLuis Elizondo, a military intelligence official, directed AATIP from the fifth floor of the Pentagon. Some of the money from the program reportedly went to Bigelow Aerospace, headquartered in Las Vegas. In May, the companys founder Robert Bigelow said on 60 Minutes that he was absolutely convinced that extraterrestrials exist and they have visited Earth as UFOs. He also said China and Russia are much more open and work on [investigating UFOs] with huge organizations.\nElizondo said that, as part of AATIP, Bigelows company studied metals and other materials that had reportedly been recovered from UFOs, interviewed witnesses and physically examined people who said they had experienced physiological changes from UFO encounters. \nElizondo resigned in October, asking in his resignation letter to Defense Secretary James Mattis, Why arent we spending more time and effort on this issue [of unidentified aerial phenomena]? Elizondo is currently the Director of Global Security and Special Programs at To The Stars Academy of Arts and Sciences, a Public Benefit Corporation whose mission includes exploring exotic science and technologies, according to its website.\nThe Times reported that about $22 million had been appropriated for AATIP from 2008 to 2011. Pentagon spokeswoman Dana White said the program ended in the 2012 timeframe. Reid said in Nevada this year, I think its one of the good things I did in my congressional service. Ive done something that no one has done before. \nThe Times reported that Pentagon officials who had been part of AATIP continue to investigate UFO sightings from the military without directly appropriated funding for the work. The CIA released over 12 million pages of declassified documents this year that included UFO sightings. One video released by AATIP is of a Navy F/A-18 Super Hornet view screen, which shows a dark flying object with a surrounding lighter area; the object travels for a time and then rotates as it travels further.\nFrom 1947 to 1969, the Pentagon ran programs to investigate UFOs. From 1952 to 1969, the program was called Project Blue Book. Of more than 12,000 UFO sightings it investigated, 701 remained unidentified. \nThe Times cited M.I.T. astrophysicist Sara Seager, who cautioned that not knowing the origin of an object does not mean that it is from another planet or galaxy, according to the outlet.

Israeli Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman said Israel would suspend gas and fuel deliveries through the Kerem Shalom crossing until Sunday. Commercial cargo was suspended from delivery through the crossing last week, while food and medication is still permitted to cross.\nIsrael said Hamas, an Islamic political organization with an armed division that governs the Gaza territories, continues to send incendiary kites and balloons across the border. Israel, which considers Hamas a terrorist organization, estimated that about 2,500 acres of nature reserves and parks near Gaza have been burned or damaged by the incendiary devices.\nLieberman said Israel would also increase its naval blockade on Gaza. Palestinians would be restricted from sailing beyond three nautical miles off Gazas coast, down from the previous blockade of six nautical miles. Israel says the naval blockade is needed to protect its citizens from weapon smuggling.\nOn Saturday, Hamas allegedly launched several rockets toward Israel, with one reportedly injuring four Israelis when it landed on a residential home in Sderot, a city in western Israel. The Israeli army responded with airstrikes across Gaza that killed at least two Palestinians and injured 14 others.\nIsrael and Egypt have maintained a partial air, land and sea blockade on Gaza since the 1990s, and strengthened it in 2007, in response to Hamas alleged militant actions against Israel, according to the U.N. \nSources: AP, BBC, OCHA OPT",

The Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA) tweeted that the outage occurred before 10 a.m. local time, and that it could take 24 to 36 hours to restore electricity to customers who had it before the blackout.\n\nTens of thousands of PREPAs customers have been without power on an ongoing basis since Hurricane Maria in September of last year.\nLionel Orama, an electrical engineer and professor at the University of Puerto Rico, said the transmission line that was downed was a huge one that connects two main power plants in the south of the island.\nBy 3:30 p.m. local time, power had been restored to at least seven municipalities and five hospitals, according to CNN. PREPA said it was prioritizing bringing back power to hospitals, the San Juan airport, water pump systems and financial institutions.\nLast week, about 870,000 customers lost power, about half of PREPAs total customers, when the same contractor knocked over a tree while clearing vegetation.\nAfter Hurricane Maria passed over Puerto Rico in September of last year, at least 95 percent of the island was without power. The blackout after Hurricane Maria was the second largest in recorded history; a 2013 power outage caused by Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines was the largest.\nPuerto Rico has a population of about 3 million people. \nSources: CNN, CNN, USA Today",

      "Content": "Overnight Saturday, Israel helped evacuate hundreds of White Helmet volunteer rescue workers and their families out of Syria into the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights and then to Jordan. Jordan's Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi tweeted that 422 people had been evacuated. The White Helmets, also known as the Syrian Civil Defense, operate in rebel-held parts of Syria, running rescue missions after airstrikes and other attacks in the countrys civil war.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said President Donald Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, as well as officials from other countries, had requested Israels help with the evacuation. British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the U.K. had also requested the evacuation. \nNetanyahu said, The lives of these people, who have saved lives, were now in danger. I therefore authorized their transfer via Israel to other countries as an important humanitarian gesture. \nAccording to its website, The White Helmets unarmed and neutral rescue workers have saved more than 114,431 people from the attacks in Syria. Russia and supporters of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad have said the White Helmets support Syrian rebels and have connections with jihadist groups. Assad said the White Helmets used humanitarian masks and umbrellas just to implement a certain agenda.\nRaed al-Saleh, head of the White Helmets, said a number of volunteers and their families were evacuated for purely humanitarian reasons. He added, they were trapped in a dangerous area. Syrian government and allied forces have been on an offensive in southwestern Syria since June.\nAfter the evacuation, the Israel Defense Force (IDF) said \"Israel continues to maintain a non-intervention policy regarding the Syrian conflict.\"\nAbout 100 of those evacuated to Jordan were White Helmets; the rest were family members, BBC reported. The original plan had been to evacuate about 800 people. Reuters cited a non-Jordanian source saying government checkpoints and the presence of Islamic State (IS) in the area near the evacuation had limited the number of people able to be transported across the Syrian-Israeli border.\nJordan's government confirmed it had authorized the United Nations to organize the passage of 800 Syrian citizens through Jordan to be resettled in Western countries. The UNHCR, the U.N. refugee agency, said While in Jordan, UNHCR in close collaboration with the involved governments, is supporting their temporary stay in anticipation of their onward relocation to third countries.\nJordan said, \"Britain, Germany and Canada made a legally binding undertaking to resettle them within a specified period of time due to 'a risk to their lives'.\"\nA spokeswoman for the German interior ministry said the country would accept eight White Helmets and their families.\nCanada said it had agreed to accept 50 White Helmets and their families, the CBC reported.\nBritain said it would provide protection to as many of the volunteers and their families as possible.\nThe White Helmets began in early 2013, according to BBC, after the Syrian civil war started in 2011. It is composed of about 3,000 volunteers who also do repair work, and about 200 of its members have been killed. The group is funded by public donations and foreign governments.\nSources: Al Jazeera, BBC, Reuters\n",

Trump said, I think that [Muellers] probe is a disaster for our country  There was no collusion at all, everybody knows it.\nTrump also said, My people came to me  [National Intelligence Director] Dan Coats came to me and some others  they said they think its Russia. I have President Putin; he just said its not Russia. I will say this: I dont see any reason why it would be. He added, I have great confidence in my intelligence people, but I will tell you that President Putin was extremely strong and powerful in his denial today. See the press conference here.\nAlso on Monday, Coats issued a statement saying, The role of the Intelligence Community is to provide the best information and fact-based assessments possible for the President and policymakers. We have been clear in our assessments of Russian meddling in the 2016 election and their ongoing, pervasive efforts to undermine our democracy, and we will continue to provide unvarnished and objective intelligence in support of our national security.\nMonday, 3:40 p.m.\nTrump tweeted, As I said today and many times before, I have GREAT confidence in MY intelligence people. However, I also recognize that in order to build a brighter future, we cannot exclusively focus on the past  as the worlds two largest nuclear powers, we must get along!\nMonday, 4:29 p.m. \nTrump tweeted regarding his meeting with Putin, I would rather take a political risk in pursuit of peace, than to risk peace in pursuit of politics.\nMonday, 4:34 p.m. \nTrump tweeted, A productive dialogue is not only good for the United States and good for Russia, but it is good for the world.\nTuesday, 10:22 a.m.\nTrump tweeted, While I had a great meeting with NATO, raising vast amounts of money, I had an even better meeting with Vladimir Putin of Russia. Sadly, it is not being reported that way - the Fake News is going Crazy!\nTuesday, 2:30 p.m.*\nAt a White House meeting with lawmakers, Trump said he realized there is some need for clarification about his remarks on alleged Russian interference in the 2016 US election. He said hed reviewed a transcript and video of his remarks, and that In a key sentence in my remarks I said the word would instead of wouldnt  The sentence should have been: I don't see any reason why it wouldnt be Russia. Sort of a double negative.\nHe added, I have, on numerous occasions, noted our intelligence findings that Russians attempted to interfere in our elections. Unlike previous administrations, my administration has and will continue to move aggressively to repeal any efforts  and repel  we will stop it, we will repel it  any efforts to interfere in our elections. Were doing everything in our power to prevent Russian interference in 2018. Read a transcript of his remarks here.\nWednesday, 5:53 a.m.\nTrump tweeted, So many people at the higher ends of intelligence loved my press conference performance in Helsinki. Putin and I discussed many important subjects at our earlier meeting. We got along well which truly bothered many haters who wanted to see a boxing match. Big results will come!\nWednesday, 7:27 a.m.\nTrump tweeted, Some people HATE the fact that I got along well with President Putin of Russia. They would rather go to war than see this. Its called Trump Derangement Syndrome!\nWednesday, 12:30 p.m.*\nDuring a Cabinet meeting at the White House, Trump was asked by a reporter, Mr. President, is Russia still targeting the U.S.? Is Russia still targeting the U.S., Mr. President? Trump responded, Thank you very much. No. The reporter then asked, No, you dont believe that to be the case? To which Trump replied, No. Thank you very much everybody.\nThe reporter finally asked, But can you just clarify, you dont believe that to be the case? Trump responded, Were doing very well. Let me tell you, were doing very well. And were doing very well, probably as well as anybody has ever done with Russia. And theres been no President ever as tough as I have been on Russia. All you have to do is look at the numbers. Look at what weve done. Look at sanctions. Look at ambassadors not there. Look, unfortunately, at what happened in Syria recently. And I think President Putin knows that better than anybody, certainly a lot better than the media. He understands it. And hes not happy about it, and he shouldnt be happy about it  because theres never been a President as tough on Russia as I have been. Okay, thank you very much. Thank you very much. Read a transcript of his remarks here. Watch video of his remarks here.\nThe reporter who asked the question tweeted later Wednesday, Yes, [Trump] was looking directly at me when he spoke. Yes, I believe he heard me clearly.\nWednesday, 2:45 p.m.*\nRegarding Trumps response to the reporter, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said, I got a chance to speak with the President after his comments, and the President was  said, Thank you very much, and was saying no to answering questions. The President and his administration are working very hard to make sure that Russia is unable to meddle in our elections as they have done in the past and as we have stated.\nA reporter then asked, So he does believe its going on? To which Sanders replied, Well, since theres currently not an election today, not specifically, but we certainly believe that we are taking steps to make sure they cant do it again. Unlike previous administrations, this President is actually taking bold action and reform to make sure it doesnt happen again. But he does believe that they would target, certainly, U.S. elections again. Read a transcript of her remarks here.\nWednesday, 5 p.m.*\nIn a televised interview, CBS News anchor Jeff Glor asked Trump, You say you agree with U.S. intelligence that Russia meddled in the election in 2016. Trump responded, Yeah and I've said that before, Jeff. I have said that numerous times before, and I would say that is true, yeah. Glor then asked, But you haven't condemned Putin, specifically. Do you hold him personally responsible? To which Trump replied, Well I would, because he's in charge of the country. Just like I consider myself to be responsible for things that happen in this country. So certainly as the leader of a country you would have to hold him responsible, yes.\nGlor then asked, But he denies it, so if you believe US intelligence agencies, is Putin lying to you? And Trump replied, I don't want to get into whether or not he's lying. I can only say that I do have confidence in our intelligence agencies as currently constituted. I think that Dan Coats is excellent, I think that [CIA Director] Gina [Haspel] is excellent. I think we have excellent people in the agencies. And when they tell me something it means a lot.\nGlor asked, Coats says the threat is ongoing. Do you agree with that? To which the president replied, Well, I'd accept, I mean he's an expert. This is what he does. He's been doing a very good job. I have tremendous faith in Dan Coats. And if he says that, I would accept that. I will tell you, though, it better not be. It better not be. Read a transcript of the interview here.\nThursday, 6:59 a.m.\nTrump tweeted, The Fake News Media wants so badly to see a major confrontation with Russia, even a confrontation that could lead to war. They are pushing so recklessly hard and hate the fact that Ill probably have a good relationship with Putin. We are doing MUCH better than any other country!\nThursday, 7:13 a.m. \nTrump tweeted, Trump recognized Russian Meddling MANY TIMES. Thank you to @foxandfriends and @FoxNews for actually showing the clips. The Fake News wants no part of that narrative! Too bad they dont want to focus on all of the ECONOMIC and JOBS records being set.\nThursday, 9:24  9:30 a.m.\nTrump sent two tweets, which said, The Summit with Russia was a great success, except with the real enemy of the people, the Fake News Media. I look forward to our second meeting so that we can start implementing some of the many things discussed, including stopping terrorism, security for Israel, nuclear........ proliferation, cyber attacks, trade, Ukraine, Middle East peace, North Korea and more. There are many answers, some easy and some hard, to these problems...but they can ALL be solved!\nThursday, 3:51 p.m. \nSanders tweeted, In Helsinki, @POTUS agreed to ongoing working level dialogue between the two security council staffs. President Trump asked @Ambjohnbolton to invite President Putin to Washington in the fall and those discussions are already underway.\nNote: All times are shown in EDT; date and times marked by an asterisk were taken from a CNN timeline.",

Rouhani said Iran could remain in the agreement if the other non-American signatories guaranteed his countrys interests. The Iranian president also said the country was considering all options, including the possibility it would resume nuclear activity if the deal was terminated completely. \nTrump said on Monday he would announce his decision on the agreement on Tuesday, prior to the May 12 deadline he originally set. I will be announcing my decision on the Iran Deal tomorrow from the White House at 2:00pm, Trump tweeted.\nThe Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) agreement, signed in 2015 after 18 months of negotiations, lifted some economic and diplomatic sanctions on Iran in exchange for limits to its nuclear program. Iran, the U.S., Russia, China, France, Germany and the United Kingdom are party to the agreement. (Read more background on JCPOA here.)\nIn January, Trump announced that he was waiving the application of certain nuclear sanctions, but only in order to secure our European allies agreement to fix the terrible flaws of the Iran nuclear deal, saying that he would withdraw from the deal if the flaws, including scheduled termination of some of the clauses, werent adequately addressed. The next deadline for Trump to continue to waive the sanctions is May 12. \nLast week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused Iran of lying when it said it had never had a nuclear weapons program, and that Iran intensified efforts to hide nuclear weapons files after signing JCPOA. As part of ongoing JCPOA inspections, the U.N.s International Atomic Energy Agency has certified that Iran does not have nuclear weapons. \nRouhani said Monday, What Iran wants is our interests to be guaranteed by its non-American signatories, and if that means removing the U.S. from the agreement it would be fine for Iran. \nIf they want to make sure that we are not after a nuclear bomb, we have said repeatedly that we are not and we will not be, Rouhani said, adding the deal ensures that Iran does not seek nuclear weapons. But if they want to weaken Iran and limit its influence whether in the region or globally, Iran will fiercely resist, Rouhani said. \nIranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif also said the country was considering withdrawing from JCPOA if the U.S. does. The head of Irans Atomic Energy Organization, Ali Akbar Salehi, said the country would resume enriching uranium within days if JCPOA is terminated.\nThe French and German foreign ministers, Jean-Yves Le Drian and Heiko Maas, announced after a joint meeting that their countries, along with the U.K., remain committed to the agreement. We dont think there is any justifiable reason to pull out of this agreement and we continue to make the case for it to our American friends, Maas said. \nWhat could happen if the US withdraws?\nJCPOA has a dispute resolution mechanism that grants at least 35 days to address a claim that a party has violated terms. This time period can be extended if all parties agree. If after having followed this procedure, a party determines the complaint is unresolved, it can choose to cease performing its commitments under the JCPOA and notify the U.N. Security Council. The Security Council can vote on a resolution to determine whether to keep the sanctions lifted. If such a resolution does not pass, the former U.N. sanctions would be reimposed, unless the Security Council decides otherwise.\nFive of the six non-Iranian JCPOA members are also permanent members of the U.N. Security Council (Germany being the exception), and thus have a right to veto, which can prevent a resolution or decision from being adopted. The previous U.N. sanctions included a ban on the import and export of nuclear materials, a ban on arms exports, asset freezes and travel bans. \nIf the Security Council rejects a U.S. motion to terminate JCPOA, the U.S. can reimpose its own sanctions on Iran. As part of JCPOA, the U.S. had lifted sanctions on financial and banking transactions with Iran and investments in the oil industry, as well as prohibitions on commercial aircraft sales to Iran. Under U.S. law, there would be an 180 day delay on reimposing penalties on U.S banks for violating sanctions, according to Iran Daily. \nSources: White House, JCPOA, UN Voting, AP, Iran Daily, Press TV, USA Today",

      "Content": "On Thursday, President Donald Trump signed an executive order establishing the National Council for the American Worker. The council will be comprised of cabinet members and administration officials who will work to develop a national strategy for training and retraining workers for the 21st century economy and the emerging industries of the future. \nThe executive order said the Council, among other priorities, would:\n\n\tdevelop recommendations on how the federal government can work with private sector, unions and local governments to provide \"affordable education and skills-based training.\"\n\twork with various agencies to consistently apply recommendations.\n\tdevelop an awareness campaign for education in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).\n\tdevelop a plan for \"recognizing\" companies that demonstrate \"excellence\" in training programs to develop best practices.\n\tmake a recommendation for \"a specific course of action for increasing transparency related to education and job-training program option,\" including proposing ways to increase public access to job data.\n\texamine private and public expenditures for education and training (from primary school up), and suggest reforms to those expenses.\n\nThe order did not specify how any recommendations would be implemented.\nAs part of the job creation effort, some companies and trade groups signed a Pledge to Americas Workers, committing to increase apprenticeships and work-based learning, continuing education, on-the-job training, and the teaching of new skills. This includes a commitment to train 3.8 million workers over the next five years, CNN reported.\nFedEx, General Motors, Home Depot, IBM, Lockheed Martin, Microsoft, Walmart and 16 other companies and trade organizations signed the pledge.\nThe executive order also created the American Workforce Policy Advisory Board to advise the new council. The board members will include the Secretary of Commerce and the Advisor to the President overseeing the Office of Economic Initiatives, and up to 25 members from outside the federal government, to be appointed by the president. Board members will have expenses covered but will be not be compensated for their work.\nThe board and the council are to be disbanded in two years unless they are extended by the president.\nThe U.S. unemployment rate was 4 percent in June and 3.8 percent in May. In comparison, its 10-year high in October 2008 was 10 percent. There are 6.7 million unfilled jobs in the U.S., according to the White House.\nThe U.S. currently spends $17 billion to help fund 40 job training programs over 14 agencies. The White House has a proposed plan to \"reorganize and consolidate\" the way these funds are allocated.\nSources: Executive Order, White House Press Release, CBS, CNN",

      "Content": "President Donald Trump met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore for nearly five hours on Tuesday. After the meeting, the two leaders released a statement saying Trump committed to provide security guarantees to North Korea, and Kim reaffirmed his firm and unwavering commitment to complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.\nTrump and Kim first met one-on-one with translators for about 38 minutes. Then talks continued with other advisers present, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, national security adviser John Bolton and White House Chief of Staff John Kelly, before the leaders released the joint statement. \nThe statement included four points:\n1. The U.S. and North Korea commit to establish new U.S.-North Korea relations in accordance with the desire of the peoples of the two countries for peace and prosperity.\n2. The U.S. and North Korea will join their efforts to build a lasting and stable peace regime on the Korean Peninsula.\n3. Reaffirming the April 27, 2018 Panmunjom Declaration, North Korea commits to work toward complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.\n4. The U.S. and North Korea commit to recovering POW/MIA remains, including the immediate repatriation of those already identified.\nThe statement also said the U.S. and North Korea commit to hold follow-up negotiations, led by Pompeo, and a relevant high-level North Korean official, at the earliest possible date, to implement the outcomes of the U.S.-North Korea summit.\nTrumps and Kims face-to-face meeting was the first between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader.\nTopics of discussion\nDuring a post-meeting press conference, Trump said he expected denuclearization to begin very, very quickly, adding that the process would be verified and would involve having a lot of people in North Korea. According to Trump, Kim told him North Korea was destroying a missile engine test site. He said Kim was committed to cease ballistic missile tests. \nTrump specified that sanctions will remain on North Korea while negotiations continue between the countries. He said U.S.-South Korea joint military exercises would not be restarted unless and until we see the future negotiation is not going along like it should. \nTrump said he wanted to get U.S. soldiers out of South Korea. I want to bring our soldiers back home, he said. But that's not part of the equation right now. At some point I hope it will be. The U.S. has 32,000 soldiers in South Korea, according to Trump. \nIn a later interview with ABC News, Trump said the U.S. would stop its military war games exercises in South Korea, which he called provocative and expensive. \nU.S. military command in South Korea said Tuesday it had received no updated guidance on execution or cessation of training exercises. After the meeting, Trump called South Korean President Moon Jae-in to brief him on the meeting. A spokesman for Moon said South Korea needed more information to understand Trumps intentions regarding joint military exercises.\nTrump noted that during their meeting, he and Kim did not discuss removing American troops or nuclear weapons from South Korea.\nThe president also said human rights were discussed during the meeting. There are an estimated 80,000 to 120,000 political prisoners in North Korea, according to The Associated Press.\nTrump said at the press conference he would love to have Kim at the White House, and that he thought Kim would love to be there at some future time. I think he trusts me and I trust him, Trump said about Kim. The president said he would be willing to visit North Korea at the appropriate time.\nDuring the ABC News interview, Trump said Kim told him that his father, Kim Jong Il, had withdrawn from previous agreements because he was let down by the U.S. Kim Jong Un took power after his father died in 2011. \nKim said at the joint press conference he and Trump decided to leave the past behind. The world will see a major change. Kim called the meeting a good prelude to peace. \nKim said before the meeting that it was not easy to get here, adding, old prejudices and practices worked as obstacles to working together. But we overcame all of them, and we are here today.\nSources: ABC News, AP, CNN, Fox News, Reuters, The New York Times, The Washington Post, The White House 1, The White House 2",

CNBC reported that about $165 billion would be allocated to the military, and about $131 billion more would go towards domestic programs. The plan would increase debt limits to accommodate an estimated additional $400 billion in spending over two years. The Senate must first vote on the plan by Thursday afternoon or evening; the House would then vote on it before a midnight deadline for a government shutdown.\nPresident Donald Trump tweeted in support of the bill on Wednesday. CNBC said the House Freedom Caucus does not support the spending increases.\nThe increase in spending would include about $90 billion for disaster aid, such as hurricanes and wildfires, The Washington Post reported. Some of this aid would be allocated to Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico. Some of the increased domestic spending would include the following areas: community health centers, an extension of the Children's Health Insurance Program to ten years, opioid abuse, and infrastructure, including transportation, drinking water and broadband internet access. \nThe current short-term spending bill expires at midnight Thursday, and a government shutdown would follow unless other legislation is passed. As part of the Senate deal, another short-term spending bill would be passed to fund the government until the two-year budget agreement is finalized and passed. The House passed a separate short-term spending bill on Tuesday.\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said she and a \"large number\" of Democratic representatives would not support the short-term spending bill unless House Majority Leader Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) assured them that a debate on immigration legislation would take place. \nIn September, U.S. President Donald Trump ordered the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program be phased out. The program, which began in 2012 under the Obama administration, grants work permits to approximately 800,000 undocumented immigrants  also known as Dreamers  who came to the U.S. under the age of 16. Some DACA beneficiaries work permits are set to expire on Mar. 5, unless Congress passes legislation or a court order extends the deadline.\nAs part of the deal to pass the previous short-term spending bill, McConnell told Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) that the Senate would debate immigration legislation next week.\nSources: CNBC, The Washington Post",

The leaders role is non-hereditary, meaning it would not automatically be passed to the queens son Charles upon her death.\nLeaders from the Commonwealth have been meeting at a two day summit at Windsor Castle, near London. The queen, who turns 92 on Saturday, has been the head since 1952, after her fathers death. During that time, the Commonwealth has increased from eight member states to 53. The role of head, which carries no maximum term, aims to unify the body and make sure its goals of international cooperation and trade are fulfilled, BBC reported. The head makes visits to member states to improve relations, according to the outlet.\nIn a Thursday speech at Buckingham Palace in London marking the opening of the summit, the queen said it was her sincere wish Charles would head the Commonwealth one day.\nCommonwealth leaders announced other decisions at the summit, including a so-called blue charter to reduce pollution and a cyber declaration aimed at addressing online crime. The Commonwealth said in a statement, we recognise the threat of climate change on the world but in particular the existential threat to Small Island Developing States. U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May said leaders also agreed to increase trade among member states to $2 trillion by 2030 to fight protectionism. \nThe next summit is scheduled for 2020 in Rwanda. \nSources: Commonwealth Press Release, BBC, CNN",

      "Content": "On Saturday, Saudi Arabias attorney general said 11 Saudi princes were arrested after they protested at a palace in Riyadh on Thursday. The attorney generals statement said the princes objected to a government measure suspending subsidies that cover royal families water and electricity bills. The princes also reportedly sought compensation for the execution of a cousin convicted of murder in 2016. According to Reuters, the princes were charged with disturbing public peace and order.\nSaudi Attorney General Sheikh Saud Al Mojeb said in his statement that the princes were told their demands were not lawful and that they refused to leave the area, disrupting public peace and order. Members of security services stepped in to restore order and the princes were arrested.\nThe princes were protesting at the Qasr a-Hokm palace, and authorities took them to al-Hayer prison, where they are to remain awaiting trial. \nEconomic statistics and reforms\nThe suspension of subsidies is one of several changes to Saudi economic policy that also includes the implementation of a value-added tax (VAT). Reuters reported that the reforms are designed to increase government revenue to offset a budget deficit caused by a decrease in crude oil prices. \nSaudi Arabia implemented a five percent VAT on Jan. 1 of this year, in accordance with a 2016 agreement by the Gulf Cooperation Council (which includes six nations: Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar and Kuwait). Food, clothes, electronics, utility bills and other commodities are among the taxed items. The agreement was made to move towards a unified regional economy, and in Saudi Arabia, to improve fiscal sustainability and diversify government revenues. \nPetroleum accounts for about 87 percent of budget revenues in Saudi Arabia, according to Forbes. The country is the worlds largest oil exporter. The average annual price of Brent crude oil was $52.32 per barrel in 2015 and $43.64 in 2016. For comparison, the average price was $108.56 per barrel in 2013 and $98.97 in 2014. Reuters reported that Saudi Arabias expected budget deficit in 2018 is 195 billion riyals ($53 billion).\nKing Salman issued a royal decree this week that aims to offset costs that have increased due to the VAT and higher gasoline prices, Reuters reported. The decrees measures include: \n\n\tgiving government employees a cost-of-living allowance of 1,000 riyals ($266) per month for one year;\n\tgiving military personnel in the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen a one-time payment of 5,000 riyals ($1,333);\n\tincreasing students stipends by 10 percent for one year;\n\tincreasing social security stipends by 500 riyals ($133) per month for one year;\n\texcluding from the VAT purchases of private healthcare and education;\n\texcluding from the VAT first-time homeowners property purchases up to 850,000 riyals ($226,660).\n\nThe unemployment rate for Saudis in the country was 12.8 percent for the third quarter of 2017. It was 11.8 percent for the first half of 2014, after a period of about three years with average oil prices roughly double what they were in 2017.\nCNN said Saudi officials estimate the country has lost more than $100 billion due to corruption and embezzlement over decades. Crown Prince and heir to the Saudi throne Mohammed bin-Salman leads an anti-corruption committee formed last November that has detained more than 200 officials, according to Reuters. Authorities reportedly released some of those detained after they agreed to financial settlements. \n",

      "Content": "The U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill on Thursday to reauthorize the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Amendment Act (FISA) for six years. The bill would allow the U.S. government to continue to collect data on non-U.S. persons outside the country, without a warrant. It allows intelligence agencies to obtain data in emails and phone calls from companies like Google and ATT that collect such information. The bill passed 256-164. It will now be sent to the Senate.\nThe House voted against an amendment to the bill that would have required warrants in some cases for intelligence agencies to read Americans communications with non-U.S. persons who are under surveillance. The term non-U.S. persons includes foreigners without permanent residency in the U.S. The Trump administration opposed the amendment, which failed to pass the House by a vote of 183-233. \nSen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) is a co-sponsor of a Senate version of the amendment rejected by the House. On Thursday, he tweeted, No American should have their right to privacy taken away! #FILIBUSTER.\" \nCongress passed the FISA Amendments Act of 2008 to legalize a warrantless surveillance program that was created after the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, according to The New York Times. The original FISA Act passed in 1978.\nFBI Director Christopher A. Wray said section 702 of the FISA Act is a valuable tool to fight terrorism.\nTrumps tweets before the vote\nU.S. President Donald Trump tweeted at 7:33 a.m. ET on Thursday: House votes on controversial FISA ACT today. This is the act that may have been used, with the help of the discredited and phony Dossier, to so badly surveil and abuse the Trump Campaign by the previous administration and others?\nAt 9:14 a.m. ET on Thursday, Trump tweeted, With that being said, I have personally directed the fix to the unmasking process since taking office and todays vote is about foreign surveillance of foreign bad guys on foreign land. We need it! Get smart! \nThe bill passed before noon.\nBackground on the unmasking process\nTrumps tweet mentioned an unmasking process. Under Section 702 of FISA, the identities of Americans whom foreigners are speaking with or about may be masked in intelligence reports. The unmasking refers to senior government officials asking an intelligence agency to reveal the names of Americans or U.S. entities in a piece of intelligence to better understand the information. \nTrump alleged that the Obama administration had used the unmasking process to obtain information on Trumps presidential transition team.

      "Content": "A caravan of more than a thousand immigrants from Central America were traveling as a group through Mexico towards the U.S. border over the weekend, Buzzfeed first reported on Friday. Many of them, primarily from Honduras, are planning to enter the U.S. illegally and either claim asylum or attempt to cross the border undetected. The caravan was organized by a volunteer group called Pueblo Sin Fronteras, Spanish for People without Borders. \n\nThe group estimated 1,200 people in the caravan at the start of the journey in Tapachula, a city in the south of Mexico along the border with Guatemala. An estimated 80 percent of the immigrants are from Honduras, which has experienced increased violence following the election of President Juan Orlando Hernndez. Others are from El Salvador and Guatemala, and possibly other countries. Some of them reportedly plan to settle in Mexico. \nPueblo Sin Fronteras said the purpose of traveling in a group is to make it easier to bypass authorities and to reduce the chance of violence by members of drug cartels, or muggings. In 2010, 72 immigrants who were traveling the same route were killed by a drug cartel, Mother Jones reported.\nMexican authorities have not stopped the group to deport people who do not have travel visas, according to Buzzfeed. Mexicos Constitution protects immigrants right to free transit, among other rights, according to the countrys National Commission for Human Rights.\nThe caravan was organized into groups of 10 to 15 people, each with a leader, that comprise security, food, and logistics committees. Pueblo Sin Fronteras said the immigrants are responsible for their own expenses for food, water and bus travel. \nThe group has taken multiple forms of transport, including walking, taking buses, hitchhiking and riding on top of trains, Buzzfeed reported. They have been sleeping in town plazas, and are sometimes fed by local churches or townspeople.\nUS response\nOn Sunday, President Donald Trump tweeted, Border Patrol Agents are not allowed to properly do their job at the Border because of ridiculous liberal (Democrat) laws like Catch  Release. Getting more dangerous. Caravans coming.\nCatch and release refers to the process under which U.S. authorities detain illegal immigrants and then release them while they are waiting for court hearings. U.S. National Border Patrol Council (NBPC) union chief Brandon Judd said immigrants could benefit from that program, and if they cross the border into the U.S., the border patrol must take them into custody and process them.\nOnce [the immigrants] enter the country, even if [border patrol agents] are standing at the border with our hands out saying, Dont enter, dont enter, all they have to do is cross one foot into the border and we have to take them into custody, Judd said. If they ask for asylum or say I fear to go back to my country, then we have to process them under credible fear which allows them to be released into our country.\nTrump also tweeted, Republicans must go to Nuclear Option to pass tough laws NOW. NO MORE DACA DEAL! He added that these big flows of people are all trying to take advantage of DACA.\nDACA, or the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, can be used to grant temporary work permits to people who were brought into the country illegally as children. DACA only applies to people who have resided continuously in the U.S. since June 15, 2007, and entered the U.S. without inspection before June 15, 2012.\nThe president also said in a tweet, Mexico is doing very little, if not NOTHING to stop the migration through its southern border and into the U.S., adding that Mexico must stop the big drug and people flows, or I will stop their cash cow, NAFTA. NEED WALL!\nThe U.S. Department of Homeland Security, in a press release from last Tuesday, addressed the issue of immigration discussed at a bilateral meeting. Both sides expressed concerns with migration flows  The partners shared their mutual desire to confront transnational criminal organizations and money laundering. Lastly, both sides reiterated their long held respect for the human rights of migrants.\n\nSources: Breitbart, Buzzfeed, Fox News, Mother Jones",

      "Content": "The FBI arrested a 48-year-old suspect on Sunday, alleging he was planning an attack at a July 4th parade in Cleveland, Ohio, authorities reported Monday. The suspect was charged with attempted material support of a foreign terrorist organization, and is scheduled to appear in federal court later on Monday. FBI special agent Steve Anthony said at a news conference on Monday that the suspect made continual statements of violent intentions and expressed willingness to conduct a US based attack on behalf of al-Qaida.\nThe suspect is Demetrius N. Pitts, a U.S. citizen who also sometimes used the names Abdur Raheem Rahfeeq and Salahadeen Osama Waleed. The suspect had been communicating with a undercover FBI agent posing as an al-Qaida operative. Their interactions were recorded. \nPitts told the undercoverage agent that he was trying to figure out something that would shake them up on the 4th of July, later saying they should have a bomb to blow up at the 4th of July parade, according to the FBI affidavit. \nPitts had told the undercover agent he did not want to denote bombs himself, and considered himself more of a planner and scout, according to the affidavit. The FBI alleged Pitts at one point suggested giving remote control cars with C-4 explosives to the children of military personnel in the parade, so that the children would unwittingly detonate the bombs, or planting it under police vehicles, the affidavit said. The criminal complaint alleged the suspect scouted locations to park a van filled with explosives. \nThe suspect has a previous criminal record, including charges or domestic violence, assault and carrying a concealed weapon. Authorities began watching Pitts as early as 2015 after he sent a message to a political commentary radio show saying the U.S. would be destroyed. In 2017, the suspect reportedly posted on social media support of al-Qaida. If convicted of the terrorism-related charge, Pitts could be imprisoned for up to 20 years, according to the U.S. attorneys office.\nThe Washington Post said it was unable to immediately locate a defense attorney for Pitts on Monday.\nJustin Herdman, U.S. Attorney for the northern district of Ohio, said of the July 4th parade planned in Cleveland, our police, our sheriffs department and our Justice Department employees will remain vigilant in protecting our community. Everyone should continue to gather, continue to celebrate America, continue to celebrate our men and women in law enforcement  [and] to engage in the exchange of ideas that is central to our democracy, he said. \nSources: BBC, The Washington Post",

The county sheriff said Cruz was thought to be armed with a AR-15 semiautomatic rifle and multiple magazines.\nThe shooting began outside the high school at approximately 2:30 p.m. local time, and then continued inside. Senator Bill Nelson (D-Fla.) said he received information from the FBI indicating the shooter wore a gas mask and carried smoke grenades. Nelson also said the shooter reportedly activated a fire alarm around the start of the shooting so students would come out of the classrooms. \nAt 4:11 p.m., the county sheriff tweeted that a suspect was in custody. Police had arrested Cruz at least a mile from the school, which is about 30 miles northwest of Fort Lauderdale. According to The New York Times, Cruz had left the school at the same time that some students came out. \nThe Broward County public school system announced on Twitter that the high school would be closed for the rest of the week. \nSources: NBC News, The New York Times",

Tens of thousands of people demonstrated in the capital of Managua in the Mother of All Marches, led by the mothers of some of the 83 people who have been killed since mid-April in protests over the presidents decree of social security reforms. Wednesday was Mothers Day in Nicaragua.\nFrancisco Daz, second-in-command at the national police, said Wednesdays violence was due to criminal gangs. Pro-government forces fired on some protesters, according to activists. Some demonstrators with homemade bottle-rocket launchers fired at pro-government forces, The Associated Press reported.\nAt a Wednesday counter-rally, Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega said, We want peace for all Nicaraguan families, security for all Nicaraguan families, according to El 19, a state-controlled newspaper.\nProtests began in mid-April after Ortegas reforms were announced. On April 18, the government said it planned to decrease pension payments by five percent, increase worker social security contributions by 0.75 percent, and increase employer social security contributions by 3.5 percent. The government said the social security system would be insolvent and without liquid assets by 2019 if the measures were not implemented. On April 22, Ortega announced the government would not go through with the planned reforms.\nSome television news outlets were reportedly taken off the air during April 19 protests. Protesters have called for Ortegas resignation, citing the violence against demonstrators.\nNicaraguas Catholic church had been mediating peace talks between Ortega and student-led protesters since May 16. On Thursday, the Episcopal Conference of Nicaragua said it was suspending talks while violence continued.\nOrtega was president in the 1980s and has again served in that role since 2007, having been re-elected in 2006, 2011 and 2016.

The bill also limits the liability of experimental drug manufacturers and distributors who provide or decline to provide the drugs. The bill had passed the Senate last August, and passed the House 250-169 on May 22.\nThe terminally ill patients must have exhausted approved treatment options and be unable to participate in a clinical trial involving the drugs in order to receive the experimental drugs through this legislation. \nTrump said it was an honor to sign the bill. He had said in his State of the Union Address this year that the terminally ill should not have to travel from country to country to seek a cure. Some Democrats have said the Right to Try program would give patients false hope. \nAccording to righttotry.org, Right to Try laws currently exist in 40 states. The 10 states that do not have such laws are Alaska, Delaware, Hawaii, Kansas, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Rhode Island and Vermont. \nUnder the new bill, in order for an experimental drug to be prescribed, it must have passed phase one Food and Drug Administration (FDA) testing and continue to be under consideration by the FDA for approval. To pass the first phase of testing, the drug must not cause human fatalities in limited clinical trials. Experimental or investigative drug approvals can take years.\nCurrent FDA compassionate use program\nThe FDA currently allows access to experimental drugs under its compassionate use program. Such approval generally takes about four days, according to The Associated Press, and can be given over the phone immediately in emergency situations. The FDA grants about 1,200 compassionate use drug applications per year, according to righttotry.org. More than one million people die from terminal illnesses each year in the U.S. \nCurrent FDA compassionate use approval sometimes comes with recommendations on drug use. About 10 percent of the requests received by the FDA have come back with recommendations for using the drug more safely or noting side effects to watch for, according to Dr. Steven Joffe, a professor in medical ethics and health policy at the University of Pennsylvania's Perelman School of Medicine. \nThe FDA approved about 99 percent of applications for compassionate use of about 9,000 experimental drugs from January 2005 through December 2014, according to a study published in 2016 in the journal Therapeutic Innovation  Regulatory Science. \nThe new legislation would eliminate the need for this FDA approval before experimental drugs could be dispensed to the terminally ill.\nSources: AP, CNN, Fox News, righttotry.org, Right to Try bill",

His unfinished report was published in the news two days after his death. \nWhen Fico resigned on Thursday, he said his ruling Smer-SD party coalition government had a mandate to fulfill its full four year term, which is due to end in 2020. He announced fellow Smer party member Peter Pellegrini would replace him as prime minister. \nOne of the protest organizers, journalist Peter Nagy, said Fico's resignation is just a change of figures and does not bring change because the new government will still have the same people within it. He said the protesters believe that the only way for the public to regain trust in the state is to have new elections.\nA BBC correspondent reported that a group of about one hundred protesters left the main rally and chanted Fico to prison in front of government buildings. \nThere were protests in 35 cities in Slovakia on Friday, BBC reported, as well as in foreign cities including London, New York and Sydney, according to CNN.\nKuciak and Kunrovs death\nKuciak and Kunrov were found in Kuciaks apartment in western Slovakia on Feb. 26 after they were fatally shot, according to the International Press Institute. \nKuciak had been investigating people living in Slovakia with alleged links to an Italian organized crime group called the 'Ndrngheta, some of whom allegedly had connections for members of the ruling Smer party. News outlet Aktuality.sk, which the 27-year-old journalist worked for, published Kuciaks unfinished work on Feb. 28.\nOn March 1, Slovak police announced they had detained seven people in connection with the deaths, who Police Corps President Tibor Gaspar said have connections to Italian organized crime. BBC reported that all of the detainees have been released and that there have been no arrests made in the case.\nThe Slovak government offered a reward of 1 million ($1.2 million) for information about the case that leads to the capture, criminal charges and conviction of the perpetrators of the murder.\nInternational nonprofit organization Index on Censorship has also called for an independent investigation into the killings.\nSources: BBC, CNN",

      "Content": "On Thursday, the Polish senate voted to approve a bill that prohibits certain speech alleging Poland was complicit in crimes committed by Nazi Germany during the Holocaust. The legislation allows exceptions for academic research and works of art. The Senate passed the bill 57 to 23, with two abstentions, and Polish President Andrzej Duda has 21 days to decide whether to sign the bill into law. If enacted, phrases like Polish death camp would be illegal, and penalties for violations could include fines and up to three years in prison. \nThe Polish Foreign Ministry said the purpose of the legislation was to fight all forms of denying and distorting the truth about the Holocaust as well as belittling the responsibility of its actual perpetrators.\nWe hold the view that accusing  publicly and despite facts to the contrary  the Polish Nation and the Polish State of complicity with the German Third Reich in Nazi crimes is inaccurate, misleading, and hurtful to the victims who are Polish citizens of both Jewish and Polish descent, the ministry added.\nOn Monday, Duda said the nation has the right to defend itself from evident slander. \nThe U.S. State Department has said the U.S. opposes the legislation, saying it could undermine free speech. Israel also opposes the bill, saying that it misrepresents history. The Polish foreign ministry said the bill would not inhibit freedom of research and scholarship, freedom of historical debate or artistic activity.\nThe Holocaust in Poland \nNazi Germany occupied Poland in 1939, and established concentration camps on Polish soil. The camps include Auschwitz, Treblinka, Belzec and Sobibor. Although no single wartime count exists, an estimated 18.5 million people were killed by Nazis, including in concentration camps, according to the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum. This includes around 6 million Jewish people.\nUp to 3 million Polish Jews were killed in the Holocaust, as well as an estimated 2.7 million non-Jewish Poles. According to Israels Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial, only 380,000 of Polands pre-war Jewish population survived the war.\nYad Vashem has commemorated people for rescuing Jews from execution, including 6,700 Poles, the largest number of any country. They were honored with the title, Righteous Among the Nations. The Yad Vashem memorial also said that there were instances where Polish citizens helped the Germans.\nResponse to the bill\nThe Israel Foreign Ministry said on Thursday that the country adamantly opposes the bill, and any attempt to challenge historical truth.\nPrior to Thursdays vote, the U.S. State Department said, We encourage Poland to reevaluate the legislation in light of its potential impact on the principle of free speech and on our ability to be effective partners. The department said the legislation could undermine free speech and academic discourse. \nIn response to the U.S. statement, the Polish foreign ministry said, despite differences of opinion on the draft legislation, the bill to protect historical truth would not affect Polands strategic partnership with the United States.\n\nSources: AFP, Bloomberg, Reuters, The New York Times",

      "Content": "On Wednesday, the Palestinian Red Crescent said at least 35 Palestinians were injured during protests against the planned demolition of structures in the West Banks Khan al-Ahmar encampment. Israeli police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said officials arrested 11 protesters, some for throwing stones at Israeli forces. Some witnesses posted videos online that showed Israeli police punching protesters they were attempting to arrest.\nIsraeli authorities brought three bulldozers to the site on Wednesday in preparation for the demolition after Israeli forces left a land confiscation notice there on Tuesday, according to Reuters. Israel said the encampment structures were built illegally, and that their closeness to a highway presents a danger to those who inhabit them. A Jahalin tribe of Bedouin established the encampment after it was expelled by Israeli forces from southern Israel in the 1950s, according to Reuters. The outlet also reported that the Bedouin live in tin and wood shacks, and raise sheep and goats there.\nIn May, Israels Supreme Court approved the demolition, as the encampment was built without required construction permits. Israeli authorities approved 1.5 percent of construction permit requests by Palestinians between 2010 and 2014, according to the United Nations. Israel agreed to resettle the approximately 180 residents about seven miles (12 km) from the encampment.\nIsrael captured the territory on which the Bedouin reside in the 1967 war with neighboring Arab countries. Israeli settlements were later built around the encampment.\nOn Tuesday, the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights called for Israel to stop its demolition plans, saying, International humanitarian law prohibits the forced transfer of the population of an occupied territory, regardless of the motive.\nUnder the Oslo Accords agreed to in the 1990s, the West Bank was divided into three areas with different levels of autonomy. The encampment is located in what is known as Area C, which contains about 60 percent of the West Bank and is under full Israeli control, according to The Associated Press. Area C has about 400,000 Israeli settlers and 150,000 to 200,000 Palestinians, AP reported.\nSources: Al Jazeera, AP, Reuters",

BBC reported protesters were complying with the call to leave. Hamid said he had resigned in a bid to steer the country out of the prevailing critical situation.\nThe protesters had accused Hamid of blasphemy after a reference to the prophet Mohammed was left out of a revised oath for newly elected lawmakers. CNN said protesters claimed the oath was blasphemous because it weakened rules requiring politicians to properly reference the Prophet Mohammed. Hamid said the omission was due to a clerical error.\nAfter the resignation, the government agreed to free arrested protesters and to pay for a clean-up after the protests. Pakistans Dawn newspaper reported the protesters in return had agreed not to issue a Fatwa against Hamid. A Fatwa is a non-binding Islamic legal ruling, often issued where Islamic jurisprudence is unclear. It does not equal a death sentence.\nThe protests had been going on for more than two weeks. This weekend, at least six people were killed and around 200 injured.\nSources: BBC, CNN",

      "Content": "Former Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi said that it would be a good time for current Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to step down at the end of the current parliamentary session on June 20. When the current Diet term ends, that would be a good time for Abe to resign. No third term for him as the party president, said Koizumi, who served as prime minister from 2001 to 2006. He said in a magazine interview that Abe could harm his partys chances at re-election. Abe has not announced any plans to resign. \n\nAbes approval rating is at 26.7 percent, according to a poll by the Nippon News Network, which is the lowest his rating has been. Some polls show Abes approval in the 30s. Over the weekend, as many as 50,000 people protested outside of Japans Diet, or parliament, calling on Abe to resign, according to the protest organizers. \nMedia reports have alleged Abe might have exerted improper influence to give two educational institutes preferential treatment. In one case, a friend of Abes, Kotaro Kake, received government approval to open a new veterinary school called Kake Gakuen in a government-designated deregulation zone. It was the first approval to open a veterinary school in about 50 years. \nIn the other case, educational group Moritomo Gakuen purchased land from the government in 2016 for a school at a rate deemed below market value. The Finance Ministry reportedly sold the land at 86 percent below its value. The ministry said last month that an internal investigation determined bureaucrats had redacted documents about the sale to remove Abes name before sending them to the parliament. Abes wife Akie was once named an honorary principal at Moritomo Gakuen. \nAbe has denied wrongdoing, and said officials acted independently. He said he would resign if there was proof either he or his wife were involved in wrongdoing. Neither media reports nor investigations have presented direct evidence that Abe has improperly exerted influence. \nAbes re-election\nIn September of last year, Abe dissolved the parliament and called for an early election, saying he wanted an election to be a mandate from the people on his domestic and foreign policies. The following month, his Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and its coalition partner Komeito won a combined 312 of the 465 seats in the countrys lower house, enough for a supermajority. Prior to the election, Abe said he would resign if the LDP did not win a majority. \nLast year, the LDP changed its rules to allow a member to seek a third term as party leader. The next vote for party leader is in September. In Japan, the leader of the party with the most seats in parliament becomes the prime minister. \nAbe is scheduled to meet President Donald Trump on Tuesday at the Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. \nSources: Reuters, Japan Times, Japan Times, The Guardian, The New York Times, The Washington Post",

      "Content": "Californias governor issued two executive orders on Thursday allowing state officials to direct more resources toward fighting the states wildfires. Gov. Jerry Brown ordered a State of Emergency for Orange and Riverside counties to address the Holy Fire, which began around the Holy Jim Canyon area of Orange County on Aug. 6. Brown also signed an executive order to streamline cleanup and recovery efforts in communities affected by other fires in the state. \nThere are about 15 major fires currently burning in California, according to the governors office. More than 13,000 firefighters from California, 17 other U.S. states, Australia and New Zealand are working to put out the fires.\nOrange and Riverside\nThe Holy Fire has destroyed an estimated 9,614 acres in Orange County, according to the countys fire department. \nBrown directed the Office of Emergency Services to assist the local governments of Orange and Riverside counties in controlling the fire and protecting residents. The governors order suspended the mandatory one-week waiting period on unemployment insurance applications for anyone who became unemployed as a result of the fire. Fees for replacement drivers licenses, insurance cards, vehicle registrations and other official records held by the state have also been suspended for any resident who lost those documents in the fire. \nState officials issued mandatory evacuations orders for nine areas impacted by the fire: Holy Jim Canyon, Trabuco Canyon Recreation Residence Tracts, Blue Jay and Falcon Campground, McVicker and Rice Canyon, El Cariso Village, Rancho Capistrano, Horsethief Canyon, Glen Eden, and Sycamore Creek.\nOn Thursday, police arrested Forrest Gordon Clark, 51, for allegedly starting the Holy Fire. Clark was charged with one felony count for aggravated arson for each of at least five inhabited structures that burned, as well as arson of inhabited property, arson of forest, criminal threats, two felony counts of resisting and deterring an executive officer, and a sentencing enhancement for arson burning multiple structures, according to the California district attorneys office. If convicted, he may face a life sentence. \nWhile the district attorneys statement did not cite evidence against Clark, Holy Jim Volunteer Fire Department Chief Mike Milligan said Clark had gone to Milligans home to allegedly return borrowed fire station equipment. Two weeks prior to the fire, Clark reportedly texted Milligan saying, The place is going to burn just like you planned. Clark is being held at the Orange County jail on $1 million bail, CNN reported.\nLake, Siskiyou, Shasta, Mendocino and Napa counties\nBrowns other executive order on Thursday called for:\n\n\tExpediting cleanup of debris removal from homes and businesses that were damaged or destroyed by the fires. (It did not provide details on the cleanup.)\n\tProhibiting price gouging. \n\tSuspending planning and zoning requirements, and state fees for manufactured homes and mobile home parks.\n\tIncreasing the hiring of additional emergency personnel.\n\tProviding waivers for temporary school facilities and outdoor physical education requirements to prevent school opening delays in the fall.\n\tExtending the filing deadline for certain taxes for businesses affected by the fire.\n\tStreamlin[ing] contracting and purchasing rules. (It did not elaborate on how state purchasing would be streamlined.)\n\tImproving the coordination between state agencies handling environmental restoration in affected areas.\n\nBrown had previously announced that the White House had approved the states request for a Presidential Major Disaster Declaration for Shasta County. According to the announcement, the declaration makes residents eligible for programs such as housing assistance, food aid, unemployment assistance, counseling, medical services and legal services. It also provides state, tribal and local governments with ongoing emergency response and recovery costs, including mitigation help to reduce the potential for future wildfires.\nBrown has also requested presidential major disaster declarations for Lake, Mendocino and Napa counties; the White House is still reviewing those requests. \nThe fire in Shasta County, called the Carr Fire, has killed at least eight people, including three firefighters, according to CNN.",

Wildfires have burned 4,200 square miles (10,900 square km) in the U.S. for the first half of this year. That is above the average for the same period during the past 10 years of 3,600 square miles (93,000 square km), according to NIFC.\nOne wildfire in Colorado, the Spring Fire, has burned about 123 square miles (318 square km) and destroyed 104 homes near Fort Garland, about 205 miles (330 km) southwest of Denver, authorities said. The Spring Fire may have been started by an ember from a fire pit. Lightning started some of the other fires in the state, according to authorities. \nIn Utah, authorities evacuated 200 to 300 homes near a fire southeast of Salt Lake City. Wildfires in Utah have burned 47 square miles (122 square km) and destroyed 20 to 30 buildings since Sunday, according to Gov. Gary Herbert.\nA 113 square mile (294 square km) fire referred to as the County Fire that started Saturday and is burning northwest of Sacramento has resulted in authorities ordering at least 2,500 people to evacuate, according to Anthony Brown, a spokesman with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. \nSome municipalities canceled planned Fourth of July fireworks celebrations. In Winters, California, west of Sacramento, officials cited poor quality and smoke covering the town in canceling its fireworks display. Parowan City, Utah, canceled its fireworks show due to extremely dry conditions this year. In Colorado, 40 percent of municipalities canceled their firework displays, according to ABC News. \nSources: ABC News, AP, CBS News",

The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) alleged that armed groups and police have used excessive and arbitrary force against the student protesters.\nIts essential to immediately halt the violence and rebuild national political dialogue, Guterres said at the 40th anniversary event of the IACHR. Only a political solution is acceptable. \nProtests began April 18 when the government announced it would reduce public pension benefits. While the government withdrew the plan, general demonstrations against the government continued. The opposition has called for Ortega to step down and call elections.\nThe Nicaraguan president says he is open to dialogue and to having the IACHR verify that human rights have been respected in the country.\nOn Monday, the U.S. State Department said in a statement that Ortegas government should hold elections. Earlier this month, the U.S. government issued a Level 3 travel advisory for travelers to reconsider visiting the country, ordered non-emergency U.S. government personnel to depart Nicaragua, and imposed sanctions on three individuals for being responsible for, or the leaders of entities involved in, serious human rights abuse in Nicaragua. \nOrtega, 72, is a former Nicaraguan guerrilla leader.

      "Content": "On Monday, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Snchez offered to receive 629 migrants at Spains port of Valencia, after Italy and Malta declined to let the ship dock. The ship, named the Aquarius, rescued the migrants from the Mediterranean Sea, off the coast of Libya, on Saturday. About one quarter of the migrants come from Sudan, according to the rescue group SOS Mditerrane. \nIts our duty to avoid a humanitarian catastrophe and offer a secure port for these people, Snchez said.\nItalian naval ships, cargo vessels and the Aquarius rescued the migrants on Saturday from inflatable boats. All of the migrants were transferred to the Aquarius, which traveled north towards Italy. The Italian interior minister, Matteo Salvini, said the Mediterranean island country of Malta should accept the vessel. On Monday, Salvini wrote on Facebook, Saving lives at sea is a duty, but transforming Italy into an enormous refugee camp is not. \nMaltese Prime Minister Joseph Muscat declined to accept the Aquarius, saying Malta was not involved with the rescue operation and Italy was creating a dangerous situation by refusing to receive the migrants. On Monday, Malta sent a supply boat with food and water to be delivered to the Aquarius, according to AP. \nThe Aquarius is more than 870 miles (750 nautical miles or 1,400 km) from Valencia. To sail there requires at least two more days of sailing, according to SOS Mditerrane Maritime Operations Manager Antoine Laurent. Doctors Without Borders said the migrants are stable, adding that some of the passengers had seawater in their lungs and chemical burns from gasoline mixing with water.\nSources: AP, NPR",

      "Content": "On Wednesday, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Elihu Berle rendered a proposed ruling that would require sellers of ready-to-drink coffee in California to provide warnings that coffee contains acrylamide, a known carcinogen. The ruling is the result of a lawsuit filed in 2010 by a nonprofit group, Council for Education and Research on Toxics, against Starbucks Corp. and 90 other defendants. \nThe suit was based on Californias Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act, also known as Proposition 65, which says, No person in the course of doing business shall knowingly and intentionally expose any individual to a chemical known to the state to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity without first giving clear and reasonable warning. Proposition 65 requires warnings for about 900 chemicals, according to the Associated Press. \nAcrylamide is not added to coffee; it is produced in a chemical reaction that occurs when coffee beans are roasted. That fact is not disputed, according to the proposed ruling. \nWilliam Murray, president and CEO of the National Coffee Association, said the amount of acrylamide in coffee is miniscule, that coffee contains hundreds of substances and that it has been shown to be a healthy beverage. In his proposed ruling, Berle said the defendants did not conduct a quantitative assessment of the risk of cancer from exposure to acrylamide in coffee.\nThe defendants have two weeks to file objections. If the ruling stands, the judge could begin another phase of the trial to consider potential civil penalties for up to $2,500 per person exposed to acrylamide in coffee each day over the last eight years.`\nSources: Court document, AP, The New York Times",

Teachers in Kentucky protested Monday as well, opposing changes to their pension system. \nIn Oklahoma, approximately 200 of the states 500 school districts shut down on Monday, according to the New York Times. The teachers are seeking pay increases, $10,000 for teachers and $5,000 for school support staff, as well as an additional $200 million in school funding, according to the state teachers union. \nLast week, Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin signed into law legislation for teachers to receive a pay increase of approximately $6,100, support staff to receive a raise of $1,250, coupled with an additional $50 million in funding, CNN reported. The teachers said these increases were insufficient. It was the first pay increase for Oklahoma teachers in 10 years. Oklahoma City Public Schools have announced schools will be closed Tuesday, as well.\nIn Kentucky, a bill was passed in the state legislature last week that, if enacted, would phase out the current benefits package retirement plan for teachers, and implement a hybrid retirement plan for new teacher hires. \nKentuckys state pension plan is 56 percent funded, according to the Associated Press. Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin has not signed the bill into law. Teachers rallied near the House and Senate chambers, opposing the bills final passage. There were 25 Kentucky school districts closed due to the walkout, according to CNN. \nA teachers strike in West Virginia ended last month with an agreement that the government would raise the pay of state employees, including teachers, by five percent and that teachers health plan premiums would stay the same for 16 months.\nSources: AP, CNN, The New York Times",

      "Content": "The Department of Defense (DoD) will house up to 20,000 unaccompanied alien children in the coming months, the Pentagon announced. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) made the request, the Pentagon notified lawmakers on Wednesday. Military spokesman Lt. Col. Jamie Davis said on Thursday the Pentagon would support the request.\nHHS employees or contractors would provide care for the children, including supervision, meals, clothing, medical services, transportation or other daily needs, according to the memo to lawmakers. The occupancies could begin as of July, the Pentagon said. The DoD would be reimbursed for the costs, in compliance with the Economy Act.\nImmigrant children have been housed in military bases before. In 2014 under the Obama administration about 7,000 unaccompanied children were housed on three military bases, The Washington Post reported.\nSeparately, an anonymous official from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said on Friday that about 500 alien children have been reunited with their families since May. DHS last week said 2,342 immigrant children have been separated from their parents since April. The official did not specify whether the 500 reunited children were still being detained with their families. \nAn anonymous Trump administration official told The Associated Press Thursday that federal agencies were working to establish a centralized reunification process for separated families at a facility north of the border in Texas, at the Port Isabel Detention Center.\nTrumps immigration policy\nOn Wednesday, President Donald Trump signed an executive order that directed authorities to detain alien families together where appropriate and consistent with law and available resources. He said his administration would continue its zero-tolerance immigration policy that called for all adults who were found illegally crossing the border to be charged with federal crimes for illegal entry or attempted entry.\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions announced the policy in April. Under federal law, children cannot be held in adult criminal detention centers, so the policy has resulted in children being separated from parents or guardians.\nAdditionally, a 1997 court agreement called the Flores settlement limits the length of time that unaccompanied undocumented children may be held in immigration detention. A July 2016 ruling in the Ninth Circuit said the Flores settlement applied to both unaccompanied and accompanied children, and that the agreement did not allow families to be detained with children beyond 20 days, the American Immigrant Lawyers Association reported.\nTrumps Wednesday executive order directed the attorney general to promptly file a request with a federal court to modify the Flores settlement, to allow DHS to detain alien families together throughout the pendency of criminal proceedings for improper entry or any removal or other immigration proceedings.\nProsecuting illegal immigrant parents\nA federal public defenders office in Texas said Thursday that the U.S. Attorneys Office would dismiss cases where parents were charged with illegally entering the U.S. and were then separated from their children, the Associated Press reported.\nGoing forward, they will no longer bring criminal charges against a parent or parents entering the United States if they have their child with them, wrote the federal public defender for the Western District of Texas, Maureen Scott Franco, in an email. \nThe Trump administration has not publicly said criminal charges would not be pursued.\nImmigrant detentions and costs\nICE has two family detention centers in Texas and a smaller one in Pennsylvania, with a combined capacity of about 3,000 beds, The Washington Post reported. Nearly 2,600 total beds were occupied in the facilities as of June 9, according to the Post. For adults held individually, ICE leases detention facilities and empty cells from various states and counties.\nICE had an average daily detainee population of 41,280 during the 2018 fiscal year to date, which, according to the Post, costs more than what Congress has authorized DHS to spend.\nAccording to The National Immigrant Justice Center, congressional appropriations law has required ICE to maintain a detention bed quota since 2009, currently requiring the agency to have 34,000 immigration detention beds on a daily basis. The cost of detaining one person per day is about $159, the center reported, at an approximate total daily cost of $5.5 million and an annual cost of more than $2 billion. The ICE 2018 budget places the average cost to maintain one adult detention bed at about $134 a day.\nDue to the increase in separations from parents since the zero-tolerance policy was announced in April, authorities have created so-called tent cities to house alien children. HHS said beds cost $775 per child per night, NBC News reported.\nICE has used alternatives to detention (ATD) for illegal immigrants who do not pose a risk to public safety to be released while awaiting immigration hearings. ATDs can cost ICE between 70 cents and $17 per person per day, according to the National Immigrant Justice Center, and can include parole, bond, home visits, reporting to ICE offices and GPS monitoring devices.\nImmigrant removals\nIn 2017, ICE conducted 143,470 overall administrative arrests, and conducted 226,119 removals of aliens. A removal is the compulsory and confirmed movement of an alien out of the U.S. and includes removals resulting from arrests, removals at the border and from the interior, according to ICE. The year prior, under the previous administration, ICE removed 240,255 aliens, 65,332 of which resulted from ICE apprehensions, or arrests. In the past decade, ICE removed the most aliens in a single year during 2012, with 409,849 removals.\nSources: AP, CNBC, NBC News, The Washington Post 1, The Washington Post 2",

Journalists at state-run news outlets were some of the first people to gain access to mobile internet services through state-owned telecommunications company ETECSA, Reuters reported.\nCuban President Miguel Daz-Canel has promoted the service as a means to increase the countrys economic growth, as well as promote the communist revolution. We need to be able to put the content of the revolution online, he told parliament last year, adding it would counter the banal and vulgar content.\nJournalist Yuris Nrido, 39, who works for a state-run news outlets said, I can now get an update on the news from wherever I am, including where the news is taking place.\nAccording to Reuters, certain employees at businesses and embassies have had mobile internet access since December, but ETECSA plans to broaden its availability to all 5 million of its mobile phone customers by the end of this year. Cubas total population is about 11.5 million.\nETECSA also plans to expand internet access to Cuban homes. ETECSA President Mayra Arevich announced in December that it had connected about 11,000 homes last year. Reuters reported that the Cuban government had a goal to connect at least half of homes and 60 percent of mobile phones by 2020; it did not report the current percentage of connected homes compared to non-connected homes.\nLast month, ETECSA launched a free proprietary messaging application for Cuban residents called Todus.\nETECSA charges companies and embassies $45 a month for four gigabytes of data, and mobile hotspots cost $1 an hour. The average worker in Cuba earns $30 per month, according to Reuters. Cubans can currently use two sites for free: the ETECSA portal mi.cubacel.net, and portal.nauta.cu. \nPrior to 2013, the internet was mostly only available in tourist hotels, Reuters reported. \nSources: Reuters, CUBANET",

      "Content": "On Saturday, tens of thousands of people participated in demonstrations organized by Families Belong Together to call for undocumented immigrant children to be immediately reunited with their families. In Washington, D.C., an estimated 30,000 demonstrators gathered in Lafayette Park near the White House, according to The Associated Press. There were more than 700 events around the country, including thousands who marched across the Brooklyn Bridge in New York, and thousands who marched in Chicago.\nOn its webpage, Families Belong Together had a link to a petition that read, We demand that the Trump administration stop caging children and jailing their families IMMEDIATELY -- and reunite children in immigration custody with their families at once!\nFamilies Belong Together was formed and supported by multiple organizations, including The Leadership Conference, National Domestic Workers Alliance, MoveOn and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU).\nAs part of Saturdays demonstrations, people protested on the bridge connecting El Paso, Texas with Ciudad Jurez, Mexico, and others gathered in protest outside a Border Patrol station in McAllen, Texas.\nDuring the demonstrations, police arrested five people for blocking a road outside an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) office in Dallas, and at least one person was arrested in Columbus, Ohio, when protesters blocked a downtown street, AP reported. \nFamily detention policy developments\nThe demonstrators were protesting the more than 2,000 children separated from their undocumented immigrant parents as part of the Trump administrations zero-tolerance policy since April. Last Tuesday, a federal judge in San Diego ordered the federal government to reunite separated children with their families within 14 days of the courts injunction for children under five years old, and within 30 days for older children. \nThe Department of Health and Human Services said it was reviewing its entire caseload of about 12,000 immigrant children under government care to ensure compliance with the ruling. Some of these children may have been separated from parents before the zero-tolerance policy was announced in April, and others may have been found unaccompanied.\nIn a June 20 executive order, President Donald Trump called for the attorney general to file a request with the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California to modify the Flores settlement so the government could detain alien families together during proceedings, such as criminal ones for illegal entry into the country.\nThe 1997 Flores settlement is a consent decree court agreement that resulted from a constitutional challenge of U.S. practices and regulations regarding the detention of unaccompanied immigrant children. Courts and the government have in the past interpreted the Flores settlement to limit detainment of both unaccompanied and accompanied children to 20 days.\nOn Friday, the Department of Justice (DOJ) filed documents in a Los Angeles court regarding the Flores settlement, in which the DOJ argued that families could now be detained together since the San Diego injunction barred them from being separated, unless adults were deemed unfit as parents or a danger to their children. \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU Immigrants Rights Project, said the government did not have to detain families, and could release parents who do not pose a flight risk or danger to the community. He also said undocumented migrant parents can choose to release their children if they do not want them to be held in a family detention center.\nSources: AP 1, AP 2, CNN, Reuters",

The Civil Protection Agency also reported that nearly 190 people were injured in the fires, which occurred in the Attica region of southern Greece, where the countrys capital, Athens, is located. Authorities have not confirmed the cause of the fires, CBS News reported. \nTwo fires were still burning on Wednesday morning in Kineta, in western Attica, according to CNN. Wind gusts reached up to 75 mph (120 km/h) in the area and temperatures reached about 99 degrees Fahrenheit (37C). Combined with low humidity, conditions were ideal for rapid spread of the fires, according to the National Observatory of Athens.\nMore than 15 fires started on three separate fronts on Monday afternoon, government spokesman Dimitris Tzanakopoulos said. He said Greece had requested drones from the U.S. to \"detect any suspicious activity.\" Greek anti-terrorist officials are investigating whether the fires were started deliberately, Reuters reported a security source as saying. Supreme Court Prosecutor Xeni Dimitriou has ordered an investigation to determine the cause of the fires. \nA navy frigate, two gunships, three helicopters, 12 port vessels and 30 private vessels were involved in rescue efforts, Tzanakopoulos said. Hundreds of firefighters were working to put out the fires. Greece asked for help from other nations; Cyprus, Italy, Spain and Bulgaria offered firefighting planes, trucks and paramedics.\nOn Tuesday, Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras declared three days of mourning. The Greek government approved $23 million (20 million euros) in aid for those affected by the wildfires, Tzanakopoulos said. Greek soccer team Olympiacos and its owner Evangelos Marinakis said Tuesday the team is donating about $1.2 million (one million euros) to help those affected by the fires.\nThe fires destroyed houses in the resort village of Mati, about 21 miles (33 km) east of Athens, as it moved towards the sea\nWe took our cars and went down to the sea and got into the sea to escape, said Agni Gantona, a Mati resident who witnessed the fires. But there were people who did not make it. She continued, We got into the water and stayed there for about five hours until the boats came to pick us up. \nWe were at the beach with about 250, 300 people, Gantona added. Some [people] were burned, some were near fainting from the smoke and the flames. Groups of us, we were holding each other by the hand and shouting each others names, because we could not see from the smoke.\nBoats took people from the beaches and the water off the coast of Mati to the nearby town of Rafina, where buses took them to hotels, said Tzanakopoulos, the government spokesman. \nGrigoris Leon, head of the Hellenic Society of Forensic Medicine, said, Work has started on identifying the victims of the wildfires but the majority of the bodies are totally charred. Identification efforts were occurring at a morgue in Shisto, west of Athens, Reuters reported.\nSources: CBS News, CNN, Reuters",

Jerry Chung Shing Lee, also known as Zen Cheng Li, was arrested on Monday at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York. A court affidavit said Lee was searched in 2012 and found to have top-secret information that, if revealed, could cause exceptionally grave damage to the national security of the United States. Lee appeared in court in the Eastern District of New York on Tuesday.\nLee, a naturalized U.S. citizen, currently resides in Hong Kong, China. According to court documents, Lee had top secret clearance while working at the CIA between 1994 and 2007. The affidavit said that when searched, Lee had notebooks with information pertaining to operational meetings and locations, such as phone numbers, true names of assets and covert facilities. According to the New York Times, that information was used to reveal U.S. spy operations in China, exposing more than a dozen CIA informants.\nA federal district court judge will rule on Lees case and, if convicted, he could face a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison.\nSources: Fox News, NPR, U.S. Department of Justice",

      "Content": "In a Tuesday interview with media outlet TMZ, hip hop artist Kanye West discussed free thinking. He said, When you hear about slavery for 400 years. For 400 years? That sounds like a choice. He added, its like were mentally in prison. One of the interviewers, Harvey Levin, asked West about his comments on slavery and choice, to which West replied as he motioned with his hands towards his head, Right now, were choosing to be enslaved.\nAt one point in the interview, West stood up, turned to the TMZ newsroom and asked, Do you feel that Im being free and that Im thinking free? A female voice said, Yes. \nBlack TMZ staffer Van Lathan said, I think what youre doing right now is actually the absence of thought. He added, \"You're entitled to your opinion, youre entitled to believe whatever you want, but there is fact and real-world, real-life consequence behind everything that you just said. \nLathan continued, We have to deal with the marginalization that has come from the 400 years of slavery that you said for our people was a choice. Frankly, Im disappointed, I'm appalled, and brother I am unbelievably hurt by the fact that you have morphed into something to me thats not real.\" West later walked over to Lathan and said, Im sorry I hurt you.\nLast week, West tweeted a picture of himself with a hat that said, Make America Great Again, President Donald Trumps campaign slogan. West was asked about the hat in the TMZ interview before his comments on slavery. He said, Ive never been into politics. I just love Trump. Thats my boy.\nReaction on social media\nMusician Will.I.Am tweeted, Reality: its not  it Disrespects their suffering...\nActor and director Wendell Pierce tweeted, It is clear that @kanyewest is being sensational for the sake of publicity. I could care less about that. But for you to use the murder and holocaust of slavery for your own self aggrandizement is at the core of your vile appeasement of white supremacists.\" Pierce also tweeted, Slavery wasnt a choice, it was a crime against humanity without a denouement of Justice.\nDirector Spike Lee wrote on Instagram, My brother, OUR ancestors did not choose to be stolen from Mother Africa. OUR ancestors did not choose to be ripped of OUR religion, language, culture.\nCandace Owens, Communications Director for Turning Point USA, which supports free markets and limited government, was at TMZ with West. She tweeted, The message that @kanyewest is trying to deliver is one of unity. Weve grown so used to Hollywood preaching acceptable hate that love has become a controversial position. \nDilbert comic strip creator Scott Adams tweeted a video in which he said of Kanye: His critics are completely, you know, misinterpreting what hes saying.\nWest tweets after the interview\nAfter the interview, West tweeted, we need to have open discussions and ideas on unsettled pain. He also tweeted, we are programmed to always talk and fight race issues. We need to update our conversation. \nAccording to BBC, West also tweeted, to make myself clear. Of course I know that slaves did not get shackled and put on a boat by free will.\nIn another tweet, West said the reason why I brought up the 400 years point is because we can't be mentally imprisoned for another 400 years. We need free thought now. Even the statement was an example of free thought It was just an idea, according to CNN.\nHe also tweeted I freed a thousand slaves I could have freed a thousand more if only they knew they were slaves. - Harriet Tubman, CNN reported. Some people said on Twitter that there is no proof Tubman said that, according to CNN.\nSources: AFP, BBC, CNN, Fortune, TMZ",

      "Content": "The U.S. Supreme Court ruled 7-2 on Thursday that a Minnesota law banning political apparel at polls violates voters freedom of speech. Minnesotas law prohibited voters from wearing political badges, buttons or political insignia in or near their polling places. The term political in Minnesotas law could include groups with political views such as MoveOn.org, in addition to political parties, ballot measures or individual candidates.\nChief Justice John Roberts wrote in the majority opinion that Minnesota has not supported its good intentions with a law capable of reasoned application.\" Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in the dissenting opinion that state courts should have been given an opportunity to offer a \"definitive interpretation\" of the law before the Supreme Court ruled if it was a law capable of reasoned application.\nThe case originated in 2010. A Minnesota voter, Andrew Cilek, wore a Please I.D. Me button and a Tea Party-logoed shirt to his polling station. He said he was at first not allowed to vote while wearing these items. When he returned to his polling place with his lawyer, he was allowed to vote and an election judge recorded his name for possible prosecution, which could have included a $300 fine. Cilek was not charged for the incident. The Minnesota Voters Alliance and Cilek challenged the law in court, and it reached the Supreme Court upon appeals.\nThe National Association of Counties said the law helps reduce election day delays and issues. The group said, for all the progress the United States has made in the past century, polling-place problems are still widespread.\nRoberts wrote in the majority opinion, Minnesota, like other states, has sought to strike the balance in a way that affords the voter the opportunity to exercise his civic duty in a setting removed from the clamor and din of electioneering. While that choice is generally worthy of our respect, Minnesota has not supported its good intentions with a law capable of reasoned application.\"\nSotomayor wrote in the dissenting opinion, \"Especially where there are undisputedly many constitutional applications of a state law that further weighty state interests, the Court should be wary of invalidating a law without giving the state's highest court an opportunity to pass upon it.\" Justice Stephen Breyer joined in the dissent.\nAll states currently have laws prohibiting direct campaigning or political signs inside or near polling stations. At least nine other states have laws similar to Minnesotas regarding items voters may wear: Delaware, Kansas, Montana, New Jersey, New York, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Vermont. \nSources: Fox News, NBC News, U.S. Supreme Court",

      "Content": "President Donald Trump signed an executive order Wednesday to detain alien families together where appropriate and consistent with law and available resources. The order, titled Affording Congress an Opportunity to Address Family Separation, called for the adjudication of cases involving detained illegal immigrant families to be prioritized, and for government agencies to make facilities available to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for detaining families together pending legal proceedings.\nIt is unfortunate that Congress's failure to act and court orders have put the Administration in the position of separating alien families to effectively enforce the law, the executive order stated.\nDuring the executive order signing ceremony on Wednesday, Trump said he didnt like the sight or the feeling of families being separated, adding its a problem that's gone on for many years, too many administrations. The president said that the zero tolerance policy would remain in place, noting, the border is just as tough. But we do want to keep families together.\nWe are keeping a very powerful border and it continues to be a zero tolerance, Trump said. We have zero tolerance for people that enter our country illegally. \nBackground\nIn April, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced a zero-tolerance policy that called for 100 percent of adults found illegally crossing the border to be charged with federal crimes for illegal entry or attempted entry. Under federal law, children cannot be held in adult criminal detention centers, so the policy has resulted in children being separated from parents or guardians.\nThe Obama administration had deprioritized detainment and criminal prosecution of illegal immigrants who were primary caregivers to children, and some families were held in family residential centers awaiting civil penalties for illegally entering the country. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) was also able to release families together in the U.S. with electronic monitoring of their location while they were awaiting legal proceedings.\nLast Friday, the DHS said there had been about 2,000 undocumented children separated from illegal alien adults over a six week period from April through May. On Tuesday, the department provided an updated figure of 2,342 separations since last month. Images of undocumented children crying and being held in fenced-in detention areas were published in the news media. \nThe executive order\nThe order called for other agencies, including the Department of Defense, to make any facilities that are appropriate available to DHS for the housing and care of alien families pending court proceedings for improper entry. DHS would be responsible for reimbursing the other agencies for use of their facilities, the order said.\nThe executive order called for the attorney general to prioritize the adjudication of cases involving detained families, to the extent practicable.\"\nIn addition, the order called for the attorney general to promptly file a request with a federal court to modify the Flores settlement, to allow DHS to detain alien families together throughout the pendency of criminal proceedings for improper entry or any removal or other immigration proceedings. \nThe so-called Flores settlement, a 1997 court agreement, limited the length of time that unaccompanied undocumented children may be held in immigration detention. A July 2016 ruling in the Ninth Circuit said the Flores settlement applied to both unaccompanied and accompanied children, and that the agreement did not allow families to be detained with children beyond 20 days, according to the American Immigrant Lawyers Association. \nTrump said, There may be some litigation. The president noted, We will be going through Congress. Were working on a much more comprehensive [immigration] bill.\nAfter signing the order, Trump said immigrants can come in through ports of entry if they want, thats a whole different story. And thats coming in through a process, and the process is what we want.\nDraft legislation \nAt a news conference on Wednesday prior to Trump signing the executive order, Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) said the House would vote on an immigration bill on Thursday. The bill would include provisions to avoid children being separated from parents, Ryan said. We are going to take action to keep families together while we enforce our immigration laws.\nCongressional Republicans are currently drafting two immigration bills that include potential funding for a border wall, and the possible outlining of a procedure to obtain citizenship for recipients of DACA, who are immigrants illegally brought into the country as children. \nA bill proposed by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) that is being considered in the Senate proposes doubling the number of federal immigration judges, limiting the processing of asylum cases to a maximum of 14 days and authorizing new temporary shelters for migrant families, Fox News reported.\nDetention facilities and removals\nICE has two family detention centers in Texas and a smaller one in Pennsylvania, with a combined capacity of about 3,000 beds, The Washington Post reported. Nearly 2,600 total beds were occupied in the facilities as of June 9, according to the Post. For adults held individually, ICE leases detention facilities and empty cells from various states and counties. \nICE had an average daily detainee population of 41,280 during the 2018 fiscal year to date, which, according to the Post, costs more than what Congress has authorized DHS to spend.\nIn 2017, ICE conducted 143,470 overall administrative arrests, and conducted 226,119 removals of aliens. A removal is the compulsory and confirmed movement of an alien out of the U.S. and includes removals resulting from arrests, removals at the border and from the interior, according to ICE. The year prior, under the previous administration, ICE removed 240,255 aliens, 65,332 of which resulted from ICE apprehensions, or arrests. In the past decade, ICE removed the most aliens in a single year during 2012, with 409,849 removals. \n\n Sources: CBS News, CNN, Fox News, The New York Times, The Washington Post, The White House",

      "Content": "On Saturday, an Egyptian court sentenced 75 people to death, including members of the Muslim Brotherhood, for their roles in a 2013 demonstration in support of Mohammed Morsi. Morsi was a former Muslim Brotherhood leader who became the first democratically-elected Egyptian president. The military removed him from power after a year, and army chief Abdel Fattah el-Sisi became the countrys leader in July 2013. State-run news agency Ahram Online reported Saturday that the Cairo Criminal Court referred the cases to the Grand Mufti for a final decision.\nThe Grand Mufti is the countrys leading Islamic authority, according to CNN, and must issue a non-binding opinion on any verdict before it can be finalized and the sentence imposed. A criminal court will issue a final verdict on the death sentences on Sept. 8, Ahram Online reported, and that verdict could be appealed.\nThose sentenced were part of a sit-in in support of Morsi after el-Sisi removed him from power following protests against Morsis rule. Egyptian security forces killed more than 600 pro-Morsi protesters who were demonstrating at Rabaa al-Adawiya and al-Nahda squares in Cairo. Security forces used automatic weapons, armored personnel carriers and military bulldozers while attempting to disperse the crowds in August 2013. \nThose sentenced on Saturday were accused of \"attacking citizens, resisting authorities, destroying public property and buildings, and possessing firearms and Molotov cocktails,\" according to Ahram Online.\nThe government is prosecuting 739 people for participating in the protests. Of the 75 sentenced to death, 44 are in custody and 31 at large. Sentencing is scheduled for the remaining 664 defendants on Sept. 8, with those sentences subject to appeal. Two of the remaining 664 include photojournalist Mahmoud Abu Zeid and Muslim Brotherhood leader Mohammed Badie.\nEgypt has banned the Muslim Brotherhood and designated it a terrorist organization. \nOn Saturday, Amnesty International tweeted, \"No members of the security forces have been held responsible for the violent dispersal of the Rabaa protest.\" Last month, the human rights organization said the mass trials for participants in the 2013 sit-in was a grotesque parody of justice and called for authorities to drop the charges against those whom it said protested peacefully.\nSources: AP, BBC, CNN, The Guardian",

FIFA said it found insufficient evidence to assert an anti-doping rule violation.\n\nFIFA began its investigation in response to a report Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren issued for the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) that alleged Russia had a state-sponsored system for providing performance enhancing drugs to the countrys athletes between 2012 and 2015. \nAfter McLaren issued his report, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) revoked at least 13 medals won by Russian athletes in the 2014 Olympics, for biathlon, bobsled, cross-country skiing, skeleton and speed skating. The IOC also banned Russia from competing in the 2018 Olympic games for all sports, and allowed Russian athletes to instead compete as neutrals.\n\nIn its announcement, FIFA said it had informed WADA of its conclusions, and WADA in turn has agreed with FIFA's decision to close the cases. The McLaren report named several Russian soccer players but they were never publicly identified, according to AFP. FIFA said it reviewed all information and evidence contained in the McLaren report, with the support of scientific and legal experts. \n\nFIFA spoke with McLaren and Grigory Rodchenkov, who had initially alleged Russia had the doping system. The association also re-analyzed players urine samples for banned substances. All results were negative, FIFA said. \n\nThe association said an investigation of several players unrelated to the FIFA World Cup was still ongoing and FIFA would continue to work on these cases in cooperation with WADA.\nThe FIFA 2018 World Cup is scheduled to begin June 14 in Russia. \nSources: AFP, BBC, FIFA, NBC News",

The warrant was issued after the five left Spain for Brussels over a month ago following Catalonias independence referendum on Oct. 1. Spanish authorities have charged the lawmakers with sedition, rebellion and misuse of public funds for their role in the referendum, which was considered unconstitutional by the Spanish government.\nMedia outlets reported the withdrawal of the warrant does not mean the charges have been lifted  the lawmakers could still be arrested if they return to Spain. \nRebellion is the most serious of the offenses for which the five have been charged, carrying a maximum penalty of up to 30 years in jail, according to Spanish news outlet El Pas. The Supreme Court said there was no offense equivalent to rebellion under Belgian law, which means Spain would have been obliged to try them on lesser charges if Belgian authorities were to have extradited the lawmakers to Spain on a lesser offense under the now withdrawn warrant.\nFinancial Times reported that Puigdemont said he would return to Spain after Catalonias regional election scheduled for Dec. 21.\nSources: CNN, Financial Times",

      "Content": "Paul Manafort, President Donald Trumps former campaign manager, entered a guilty plea on Friday to financial crimes and agreed to fully cooperate with the Department of Justice (DOJ), which is investigating the Trump presidential campaign. \nI plead guilty, Manafort said before U.S. District Judge Amy Berman in Washington.\nManafort, 69, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to: launder money, commit tax fraud, lie to the DOJ, fail to register as a foreign agent and fail to file foreign accounts reports, as well as an obstruction of justice charge. The crimes relate to consulting and lobbying work Manafort did for Ukrainian politicians prior to joining Trumps campaign. \nManafort was previously found guilty on 8 counts of financial crimes in a Virginia court in August (and was acquitted on 10 counts), with a recommended sentence of between 7 and 10 years in prison. Manafort was scheduled to begin a separate trial in Washington, D.C., later this month. With the guilty plea, the Washington trial will no longer take place. \nProsecutor Andrew Weissmann told the judge the plea agreement was a cooperation agreement, and that Manafort had already given the government some information. Weissmann said the remaining charges against Manafort would be dropped at sentencing or at the agreement of successful cooperation.\nThe prosecutors office outlined in the plea agreement that it placed the estimated sentencing range for Manaforts alleged crimes at 210 to 262 months in prison (about 17 to 21 years), plus a possible fine of $40,000 to $400,000. However, with Manaforts full cooperation, the agreement says the prosecutors office will file a Section 5K1.1 motion to allow for less than the legal minimum sentence, and allow Manaforts lawyers to argue for a lesser sentence, including only probation. The court will maintain the ultimate right to determine and impose the sentence.\nThe plea agreement also waives Manaforts right to appeal. \nManaforts lawyer Kevin Downing said his client wanted to make sure that his family was able to remain safe and live a good life. \nHes accepted responsibility, Downing said. This is for conduct that dates back many years and everybody should remember that.\nSpecial Counsel Robert Muellers team is investigating alleged Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, whether any members of Trumps campaign improperly cooperated with Russia, and related matters. \nManafort worked for the Trump campaign for about six months in 2016. During that time, he was in attendance at a June 2016 Trump Tower meeting with the presidents eldest son Donald Trump Jr., the presidents son-in-law Jared Kushner, a Russia national and Russian-born Americans. The meeting was reportedly set up by an associate of Trump Jr. for Trumps campaign to receive disparaging information about presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. \nAfter Manaforts guilty plea, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said the Manafort case had absolutely nothing to do with the president or his victorious 2016 presidential campaign.\nOnce again an investigation has concluded with a plea having nothing to do with President Trump or the Trump campaign, Trump personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani said in a statement. The reason: the president did nothing wrong.\n\n\nSources: AP, CNN, Fox News, Manafort Plea Agreement",

The meeting was confirmed by Justice Department spokesperson Sarah Isgur Flores. CNN reported that Sessions was not under subpoena and that he was the fifteenth person connected with the Trump campaign to be questioned by Muellers office. He is also the first cabinet member to be interviewed.\nThe Times also reported Tuesday that Muellers office interviewed former FBI director James Comey last year. Investigators reportedly asked Comey about the memos he wrote describing his interactions with President Donald Trump. Comey testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee about the memos last June.\nAs Attorney General, Sessions had oversight of an FBI investigation into whether Russia had attempted to interfere in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. He recused himself from all matters related to this investigation in March 2017. Sessions Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein then appointed Mueller as special counsel to carry out the investigation in May last year. The appointment followed President Trumps dismissal of Comey from his post as FBI director on the recommendation of Sessions and Rosenstein.\nMuellers investigation was initially focused on Russias alleged attempt to interfere in the election. It has since expanded to also investigate whether Trump attempted to obstruct the investigation. Trump told reporters Tuesday that he was not at all concerned that a member of his cabinet was questioned.\nSources: CNN, The New York Times",

The oil company said the difference was due to fewer women than men in senior leadership and top technical and trading roles. Shell said it pays equally for equivalent work. \nShell released a YouTube video on Thursday titled, The Shell UK Gender Pay Gap, which said 16 percent of engineering graduates in the U.K. were female. Shell U.K. said 67 percent of its employees are male and 33 percent female. It said in 2017, 27 percent of its senior management roles were held by women, up from 12 percent in 2005. Shell is the largest company in the U.K.s FTSE 100 stock exchange index, according to BBC.\nThe U.K. Office for National Statistics determined the median gender pay gap for full-time employees was 9.1 percent during the first four months of this year. The rate was approximately half as much as it was in 1997, when the office started collecting statistics. \nAs of Apr. 5, 2017, the U.K. requires that companies with 250 employees or more report gender pay differences by Apr. 6, 2018. Last week, the Bank of England reported that for 2017, up to Mar. 30, its average pay difference between men and women was 21.0 percent. The bank attributed this to differences in relative percentages of roles held by men and women rather than differences in pay for a given role. The majority of companies have yet to report on pay differences.\nSources: BBC, Fox Business, The Independent\n",

      "Content": "President Donald Trump on Thursday canceled a pay increase for civilian federal workers scheduled to go into effect in January. Trump said the raise would have cost the government $25 billion. The president made the announcement in a letter to House Speaker Paul Ryan, which was posted on the White House website. \nTrump said he had the authority to cancel federal increases during a time of national emergency or serious economic conditions affecting the [countrys] general welfare. Trump said he viewed the pay increase as inappropriate, adding, we must maintain efforts to put our nation on a fiscally sustainable course, and federal agency budgets cannot sustain such increases. \nAccording to the Congressional Budget Office, the countrys current federal deficit is $804 billion. (The deficit refers to the amount by which expenditures exceed revenue.) U.S. federal public debt is more than $21 trillion, according to the Treasury Department. \nTrump said that canceling pay raises would not affect the governments ability to attract and retain a well-qualified federal workforce. Trump also called for performance-based raises for federal employees to reward high-performing federal employees and those with critical skill sets. He did not outline any metrics by which to judge worker performance, and he did not say when such performance-based raises would commence.\nIn 2010, then-President Barack Obama ordered a two-year pay freeze to help reduce the federal deficit. Obama estimated at the time that the freeze could save $28 billion over a five-year period. In 2013, Congress voted to continue the freeze for another year. \n\nSources: CBO, Treasury, Trump announcement, Obama announcement, Obama archive",

A suicide bomber attacked the entrance of the refugees and repatriations directorate compound in the city of Jalalabad. Two gunmen then entered the building, reportedly taking hostages and battling security forces for six hours before the gunmen were killed. The Islamic State militant group later claimed responsibility for the attack.\nA car containing explosives drove up to the compound at around 11 a.m. local time. Two gunmen got out and set off the first of several explosions, then Afghan Special Forces arrived and a gun battle ensued for the following six hours, Al Jazeera correspondent Charlotte Bellis reported. A witness named Obaidullah said that minutes after the gunmen entered the building, the car they pulled up in exploded. The building also caught fire during the attack, according to Reuters.\nOther attacks\nIn a separate incident Tuesday, at least 11 people were killed and 37 more wounded when a passenger bus drove over a roadside bomb in the city of Farah, officials said. Al Jazeeras Bellis said the government said the Taliban was responsible for the attack. The Taliban did not immediately claim responsibility.\nImprovised explosive devices (IEDs), such as those used in the roadside bomb, have caused 232 deaths and 645 injuries in Afghanistan in the first half of 2018, according to Al Jazeera. \nOn Saturday, attackers entered a training center for midwives in Jalalabad and battled government forces there for nearly six hours. Two people were killed in that attack. \nOn Monday, Nangarhar provincial health officials said attacks in the province in the past three months had killed at least 160 people, and more than 490 had been wounded.\nU.S.-led forces removed the Taliban from power in Afghanistan in 2001, following the 9/11 attacks. In June, the Afghan government declared a temporary ceasefire with the Taliban and the Taliban responded by declaring a ceasefire with the government for three days. Other militant groups are also active in Afghanistan, such as the Islamic State (IS).\nSources: Al Jazeera, BBC,Reuters",

      "Content": "A report published on Tuesday found that synthetic opioids, such as fentanyl, were involved in at least 46 percent of opioid-related overdose deaths in 2016, an increase from 14 percent of the deaths in 2010. This is the first time recorded that synthetic opioids have surpassed prescription painkillers to account for the highest percentage of opioid-related overdose deaths. \nThe study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), examined death certificates in the National Vital Statistics System. About 15 to 25 percent of overdose deaths did not have specific drugs listed on the death certificates, according to Christopher Jones, a researcher at the U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration and one of the authors of the study. Jones said this could mean the actual number of opioid-related deaths was higher than the number given in the report.\nIn 2016, about 19,400 (46 percent) of the 42,249 opioid overdose-related deaths identified in the study involved synthetic opioids, about 17,000 (40 percent) involved prescription painkillers and about 15,000 (37 percent) involved heroin. The sum of the percentages is more than 100 percent because some overdose deaths involved more than one drug. About 80 percent of deaths involving synthetic opioids involved other drugs such as other opioids (48 percent of the time), heroin (30 percent), cocaine (22 percent), prescription opioids (21 percent), alcohol (11 percent), antidepressants (5 percent) and others.\nJones said illicit drug dealers sometimes sell more expensive drugs mixed with less expensive synthetic opioids, and that fentanyl can also be in counterfeit prescription pills.\nSynthetic opioids such as fentanyl are made in a laboratory, while natural opioids such as oxycodone and hydrocodone are derived from poppy plants. According to Linda Richter, director of policy research and analysis at the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse, synthetic opioids such as fentanyl are about 50 times more potent than heroin and up to 100 times more potent than morphine. \nLast month, Surgeon General Jerome Adams issued an advisory recommending that people using opioids, or friends and family members of people who use opioids, know how to use naloxone and have it on hand. Naloxone is an anti-overdose medication for opioids.\nSources: CNN, HealthDay, JAMA",

A commander in the forces backing Syrian President Bashar al-Assad said Syria's Tiger Force elite unit was participating in the operation. The U.K.-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) said a ground assault had begun on Sunday and resumed Wednesday, and that government forces were advancing and taking losses. No civilians reportedly left eastern Ghouta during a five-hour daily ceasefire called for by Russia.\nRussia called for the daily five-hour ceasefires starting Tuesday so aid could enter Ghouta, and civilians and the wounded could leave through a \"humanitarian corridor.\" Bombing and mortar shelling reportedly occurred during the ceasefire hours on Tuesday. SOHR reported no bombing from the air during Wednesday's ceasefire. Russia and Syria said rebels shelled the humanitarian corridor so that people would not leave. Rebels denied the claim, and said fear of the Syrian government was preventing people from leaving Ghouta. No aid was reported to have entered Ghouta.\nOn Saturday, the U.N. Security Council passed a resolution calling for a 30-day nationwide ceasefire in Syria. It called for weekly humanitarian aid deliveries in addition to medical evacuations. It also called for an end to sieges of populated areas including eastern Ghouta, Yarmouk, Foua and Kefraya. The ceasefire did not apply to the Islamic State, Al-Qaida, Al-Nusra Front and others associated with organizations designated as \"terrorist groups\" by the Security Council.\nOn Monday, a medical official in Damascus said 36 people had been killed there by rebel shelling over four days. Russian President Vladimir Putin said shells had hit the territory of the Russian Embassy and trade mission in Damascus. He said some mortar strikes came from groups designated as terrorist organizations by the U.N.\nSyria's civil war began in 2011. Eastern Ghouta has been under siege by government forces since 2013. At least 500 people have been killed there since Feb. 18. The USAID government agency said there were three suspected chemical attacks by Syria in eastern Ghouta in 2018, including the alleged use of chlorine gas on Feb. 1.

Jim Bridenstine (R-Okla.) as National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) administrator, seven and a half months after his initial nomination to the role by President Donald Trump. Bridenstine, a former Navy pilot, will be the first elected official to be appointed head of the space agency. Fifty Republicans voted for Bridenstines confirmation and 47 Democrats and two independents voted against it. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) was not present for the vote due to health issues.\nNASA has a budget of about $20 billion and more than 18,000 employees. It performs space missions, including supporting the international space station, and also conducts research on climate change.\nOn the subject of climate change, Bridenstine said in 2013 that global temperatures had stopped rising 10 years ago. During his confirmation hearing in November of last year, he said human activity absolutely contributed to climate change. He also said he wants to make sure that NASA remains  apolitical.\nBridenstine was elected to Congress in 2012 and has been a member of the House Armed Services Committee and the Science, Space and Technology Committee. Before joining Congress, he served as Executive Director of the Tulsa Air and Space Museum  Planetarium. Bridenstine is not a scientist or a retired astronaut. Some past NASA administrators have not been scientists or retired astronauts, according to Breitbart.\nIn 2016, Bridenstine sponsored the American Space Renaissance Act, a bill that was not voted on. The act would have included directing NASA to come up with a 20-year plan outlining broad goals for the agency over that time period. \nTrump nominated Bridenstine on Sept. 5 of last year. The previous NASA administrator, Charles F. Bolden, Jr., resigned when Trump became president, on Jan. 20, 2017. Robert Lightfoot Jr. then became acting administrator. Lightfoot announced last month that he would retire at the end of April. Once Bridenstine is sworn in, he will become the 13th administrator in NASAs history since its founding in 1958.\nTrump has not nominated anyone for the position of NASAs deputy administrator. \nSources: Breitbart, HuffPost, Politico, The New York Times",

There have been no reports of deaths or injuries.\nThe Volcanology Institute said two \"explosion-type earthquakes\" and 18 tremors had happened since Monday afternoon. Some of the tremors sent out streams of lava, one of which flowed close to 2 kilometers from the crater. Filipino authorities have raised the volcano alert level to four, out of a maximum of five, and extended the danger zone to 5 miles around the crater. NPR reported that level four indicates \"intense unrest\" and the possibility of a hazardous eruption within days.\nMore than 56,000 people have been evacuated from their homes and are currently taking shelter in 46 evacuation camps. More than 30,000 ash masks, along with 5,000 sacks of rice, water and medicine are being sent to these shelters, according to the Office of Civil Defense.

Electoral Tribunal President David Matamoros said Hernndez had received 42.95 percent of the votes, and his closest opponent Salvador Nasralla had received 41.42 percent. Honduras does not have a runoff vote.\nBefore the official announcement Nasralla said he would not recognize the result. He also called for his supporters to protest against the announcement Monday. \nHernndez has yet to comment on the announcement from the electoral tribunal. His sister was killed in a helicopter crash on Saturday. \nLate Sunday, the Organization of American States (OAS), which sent observers to the election, called for a new vote due to irregularities. OAS Secretary General Luis Almagro said the election was characterised by irregularities and deficiencies, and classified it as technically very low quality and lacking in integrity.\nThe initial results, published by the electoral court the day after the November election, showed Nasralla in the lead with 60 percent of votes counted. The Financial Times reported the vote counting system allegedly crashed before the count was complete. Results published after the alleged crash showed Hernndez leading the count. Protests and allegations of fraud followed. Some of the protests have turned violent, and at least 17 people have been killed since the election.\nHernndez, 49, is a businessman and former member of parliament. He first took office as president in Jan. 2014, during a time when Honduras constitution did not allow an incumbent or former president to run for reelection. In 2015, the countrys supreme court overturned the ban, allowing candidates to seek reelection.\nSources: AP, Financial Times",

      "Content": "Since Trumps latest executive order may change aspects of the U.S. healthcare system, it may be useful to know how it currently works. Heres a brief overview of U.S. healthcare options.\nEmployer-based insurance\nAbout 49 percent of insured people in 2016 had employer-provided healthcare coverage, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF). For those people, the employers subsidize the cost of the insurance, though in some cases workers contribute to the expense via monthly payments, co-payments per doctor visit and deductibles. KFFs news network also notes that the number of choices an employer provides may depend on the size of the company, with smaller companies offering fewer options for its employees to choose from. Employees may choose insurance plans once a year.\nMedicare/Medicaid\nMedicaid is a program operated jointly by both federal and state agencies. According to Medicaid.gov, Medicaid is the largest source of health coverage in the United States. People receive Medicaid based on their income level, age and whether they have certain medical conditions, such as blindness. Examples include low income families and individuals receiving Supplemental Security Income (SSI).\nMedicare is a federal health insurance program for people who are 65 or older. It can also cover younger people with certain disabilities, and people with diseases such as End-Stage Renal Disease (permanent kidney failure requiring dialysis or a transplant, sometimes called ESRD).\nIndividual insurance\nPeople can purchase individual plans for themselves or their families through an insurance company. Pricing and options may vary by state or county of residence.\nWhat did the ACA do?\nThe law required insurance companies to, among other requirements:\n\n\tCover 10 essential benefits, such as maternity leave and prescription drugs.\n\tLet young adults stay on their parents insurance until they reach 26.\n\tProvide free preventive care services.\n\nIt also:\n\n\tPrevents insurance companies from denying coverage or charging customers more based on their health status.\n\tEliminates dollar limits or lifetime caps on individual coverage.\n\tExpands coverage for Medicare and Medicaid.\n\tCreates new marketplaces or exchanges, on which private insurance companies compete to sell plans to uninsured Americans.\n\nIndividual states can set up their own marketplaces. Alternatively, states can opt out of operating an exchange and allow their residents to purchase insurance under a marketplace established by the federal government. Individuals can still obtain insurance outside of the marketplaces. \nPrior to the Trump administration's Oct. 12 announcement, the federal government allowed people with income under a certain level to receive direct subsidies when they bought individual insurance on an exchange in order to offset their costs. \nWhat does Trumps executive order do?\nOn Thursday, President Donald Trump signed an executive order that calls for changes to three areas of the Affordable Healthcare Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare. The order aims to expand access to association health plans (AHPs), increase the maximum time limit of short-term insurance plans (STLDI), and widen the use of health reimbursement arrangements (HRAs). \nAHPs\nThe order states that expanding access to association health plans will make it easier for small businesses to join together in groups across state lines, enabling them to negotiate cheaper health plans for their employees. The Washington Post reported the AHPs will not have to comply with the ACA rules for essential benefits, or yearly and lifetime cost limits. They would also not need to be licensed in the state in which they are sold. The White House says employers would not be allowed to exclude any workers from these plans, or charge higher rates for those in poor health, according to Fox News.\nSTLDIs\nThe document calls for increasing the maximum time limit for short-term insurance plans from three months to one year. Short-term insurance policies are aimed at people who are between jobs, or younger people no longer covered by their parents health plans. The plans are not required to comply with the ACA rules about protections for people with pre-existing conditions or to include mental health coverage, maternity care, full prescription coverage, all considered essential benefits under ACA rules. There are no price limits on premiums. At the end of 2016, around 160,000 people were covered by this type of policy, according to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.\nHRAs\nHealth reimbursement arrangements allow employers to give employees pre-tax money to buy their own coverage, which does not have to comply with all ACA rules.",

      "Content": "Cambodias ruling party said on Tuesday that it would meet Sept. 25 or 26 to form a new government with a new cabinet, after announcing the day before that it would win all 125 parliamentary seats in the countrys Sunday general election. The party, the Cambodian Peoples Party (CPP), said it won 77.5 percent of the vote. On Sunday, the U.S. called the vote flawed, saying it excluded the countrys principal opposition party. \n\nCambodias supreme court dissolved the Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) last November over a complaint the party was working with the U.S. to overthrow the government. The CPP, which filed the complaint with the supreme court, said it was based on credible evidence. It added that candidates from 19 other parties ran in the election.\nWe cannot forgive those who want to overthrow the government, said Sok Eysan, spokesman for CPP, in response to the supreme court dissolving CNRP. You cannot blame the CPP.\nOfficial election results have not yet been announced. Election workers said voter turnout was more than 82 percent. We have worked so hard to achieve this result, Eysan said. \nThe White House said, The campaign was marred by threats from national and local leaders to punish those choosing not to vote.\nOpposition leaders had called for a boycott of the vote. Some registered voters submitted blank ballots or ones with all parties crossed out as a form of protest, the Post reported. The election commission has said about half a million ballots were invalid. About 7.6 million people voted, Reuters reported.\nLast Friday, the government ordered internet service providers to block U.S.-funded Radio Free Asia and Voice of America news websites in the country. Some independent media outlets in the country have closed and journalists have been arrested, BBC reported.\nMultiple foreign election observers chose not to monitor the election in Cambodia in order to not give the appearance of validating the election, according to The Washington Post. \nChina sent election observers to the country for the first time. The country recently gave Cambodia more than $130 million in military aid, and has also invested billions of dollars in infrastructure projects in the country, the Post reported.\nThe EU is considering imposing economic sanctions against Cambodia after the election, according to BBC. The EU imports about $4.3 billion worth of textiles and textile-related goods from the country, according to the Post.\nThe White House said the elections were neither free nor fair and failed to represent the will of the Cambodian people. The U.S. added that it may impose more visa restrictions as it did last December on individuals responsible for undermining Cambodian democracy. It called on Cambodia to release political prisoners, end the ban on the political opposition, and allow independent media and civil society organizations to fulfill their vital roles unhindered.\nBackground on Cambodian elections\nCambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen of the CPP party has been in power since 1985. \nBetween 1975 and 1979, the Khmer Rouge communists ruled the country and about two million people were estimated to have been killed during that time, BBC reported. Hun Sen was a soldier for the Khmer Rouge and later opposed the group. A war between the Khmer Rouge and Vietnam was followed by the Paris Peace Accords in 1991, and the U.N. administered the countrys first election two years later. The U.S. and EU gave billions of dollars in aid to Cambodia after the 1991 Paris Peace Accords. They did not provide assistance for Sundays election. \nIn 2013, the CNRP rejected that years general election results and led protests. Last year, the CNRP won about 44 percent of the popular vote in local elections. The partys 55 members of the National Assembly, which had 123 members at that time, were later removed from office after last Novembers supreme court ruling and the government jailed CNRP leader Kem Sokha on a treason charge. After last years elections, some of the partys leadership left the country and lobbied for foreign sanctions to be imposed on the country. \nThe ban of the opposition and the imprisonment of its leader, the shutdown of independent media and civil society and threats on activists had made this election unacceptable before it even began, CNRP said in a statement. History will mark [July 29] as the day Hun Sens regime invited sanctions and ultimately [will] bring down the Cambodian economy with it. \nThe country has experienced a period of economic growth under Hun Sen, according to BBC.\nSources: BBC, Reuters, The Washington Post, The White House",

      "Content": "Syria continued an offensive on rebel-held areas in the countrys southwest on Tuesday. The U.N. has said more than 45,000 people have been displaced by the fighting in Daraa province since a government offensive began on June 19. Also on Tuesday, Jordan indicated it would not open its borders to accept Syrians fleeing the attacks, saying it was at capacity. \nJordan [is] engaging all parties to end fighting, protect civilians in south [Syria],Jordans Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi tweeted on Tuesday. Host to 1.3 [million] Syrians, we are at capacity. Well keep doing all we can for them. But we cant host more.\nA commander for the forces that back the Syrian government said one of the goals of the attacks in the southwest was to take control of the Nassib crossing, an international border crossing between Syria and Jordan that has been held by rebel forces since 2015, Reuters reported. \nThe U.K.-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that Syrian government forces had taken the town of Busra al-Harir in northeastern Daraa. \"At least 200 air strikes and 150 barrel bombs targeted Bursa al-Harir this morning as government forces moved in on the village, according to Jihad Hamza, a pro-opposition activist in Daraa.\nA de-escalation agreement to cease fighting between rebels and Syrian forces in certain zones in southwest Syria, including Daraa, had been negotiated and signed last July by the U.S., Russia and Jordan. Syria's offensive is in de-escalation zones.\nSince Syria began its southwest offensive on June 19, at least 41 people have been killed and more than 100 wounded, according to Lawrence Adam, a journalist with the Nabaa media group. Adam said at least 27 of the dead were civilians.\nRebels from the Free Syrian Army showed Reuters a message from U.S. officials that said rebels should not expect U.S. military support against the government offensive. A U.S. State Department official told Reuters, We are concerned by developments in southwest Syria, particularly the intensification of Russian airstrikes and pro-regime ground attacks. This is once again an example of Russia violating arrangements it has entered into with no regard for civilian lives.\nA spokesman for the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said an airstrike had put a hospital out of operation and that five of its aid facilities in the south were out of service during the government attacks.\nState media reported that government forces had been bombing terrorist posts northeast of Daraa. \nThe Observatory and Syrian state news agency SANA reported that two Israeli missiles had hit near Damascus airport overnight Monday. An Israeli military spokesman declined to comment on the reports. Syrian rebels currently control territory along the border with the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. One goal of the Syrian government offensive is to retake that area, according to Al Jazeera.\nThe Syrian civil war has killed hundreds of thousands and displaced millions since its start in 2011. Syrian government forces took control of Eastern Ghouta in April after it began an offensive there in February. \nNearly all the northern border with Turkey and some of eastern Syria remain controlled by non-government groups, Reuters reported.\nSources: Al Jazeera, Reuters",

      "Content": "The U.S. State Department ordered family members of government personnel to leave Nicaragua on Monday, in response to ongoing protests and looting that have killed at least 10 people. The department also authorized government personnel to evacuate on a case-by-case basis. Violent protests started last Wednesday in the capital city of Managua after President Daniel Ortega announced changes to the countrys pension system. Ortega announced in a televised address on Sunday evening that he would cancel the proposed reforms. \nThe State Department said political rallies and demonstrations are occurring daily, often with little notice or predictability, adding that some result in injuries and deaths. It said looting, vandalism and arson have been occurring and that violent crimes including sexual assault and armed robbery are common. The department also said authorities have been using tear gas, pepper spray, rubber bullets, and live ammunition against protesters. \nSince last Wednesday when protests began, at least 10 people have been killed, including at least one journalist who was reporting on the protests, and at least one police officer. The governments official count said 10 were killed, while Nicaraguan newspaper La Prensa reported that more than 30 people have been killed. \nLast Wednesday, hundreds of protesters began demonstrations in Managua after the government approved changes to the pension system that would have gone into effect on July 1. BBC reported that a group of men wearing motorcycle helmets attacked some of the protesters and journalists using metal pipes and cables. Local media reported that some of the attackers wore T-shirts with pro-government slogans. \nOngoing looting and protests have taken place in the capital and other Nicaraguan cities for five days. On Friday, Nicaragua deployed army personnel to defend government buildings. Some television stations have been taken off air, and have alleged they are being censored. \nWe must re-establish order, we will not allow chaos, crime and looting to reign, the president said. The vice president said the government response to the riots is necessary as a legitimate defense against a tiny group of instigators. \nSocial security reform\nThe proposed social security reforms included requiring employees to put 7 percent of their salaries towards social security, an increase from 6.25 percent, and 5 percent of their pension into a medical expenses fund, BBC reported. The changes would also reduce payouts by 5 percent, according to Al Jazeera. On Sunday night, Ortega said he would cancel the reforms that he said acted as a trigger that started this whole situation.\n\nOrtega, 72, is in his third consecutive term since being re-elected in 2007, after serving as president in the 1980s. Earlier this year, his wife Rosario Murillo became vice president. \nSources: State Department Press Release, Al Jazeera, BBC",

He said he was sure that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo would be discussing the program with North Korea in the near future. Bolton said the year-long program would require full disclosure of all chemical, biological and nuclear programs, as well as ballistic missile sites in the country. \nIf they have the strategic decision already made to do that, and theyre cooperative, we can move very quickly, Bolton said. And it is to North Korea's advantage to dismantle very quickly. Then the elimination of sanctions, aid by South Korea and Japan and others can all begin to flow, he added.\nPhysically, we would be able to dismantle the overwhelming bulk of [North Koreas] programs within a year,\" Bolton said. \nStanford University academics have proposed a 10-year roadmap for the complete denuclearization of North Korea. Some say it could take less than 10 years.\nOn Sunday, South Korean media reported that U.S. Ambassador to the Philippines Sung Kim met with North Korean officials that day to discuss plans for Pompeos next visit to the North. \nPatrick Cronin, senior director of the Asia-Pacific Security Program at the Center for a New American Security, said U.S. and South Korean officials indicated Sung Kim was preparing a trip by Pompeo to Pyongyang at the end of this week. The State Department has not confirmed such travel plans. Pompeo recently spoke about North Korea with the foreign ministers of China, Japan and South Korea, according to the State Department.\nWashington Post and NBC News report on North Korean weapons activities\nThe Washington Post reported on Saturday that U.S. intelligence officials have concluded that North Korea has secret weapons facilities, that the latest evidence suggests it does not intend to give up all its nuclear weapons and that it may hide the number of weapons it has.\nNBC News reported that a U.S. official briefed on the latest North Korean intelligence said, There's no evidence that [North Koreans] are decreasing stockpiles, or that they have stopped their production of weapons. The official added, \"There is absolutely unequivocal evidence that they are trying to deceive the U.S.\"\nU.S. intelligence does not know the exact number of nuclear weapons North Korea has, according to Reuters. The Defense Intelligence Agency estimates that North Korea has about 50, and all intelligence agencies have concluded the country is concealing weapons.\nWhen asked about new reports this weekend on Fox News Sunday, Bolton said, \"I am not going to comment on any reports, true, untrue, or partially true, about intelligence. Bolton added, I will just say this: Not answering the specific reports we've seen over the weekend ... we are using the full range of our capabilities to understand what North Korea is doing.\"\nOn CBS News Face the Nation, Bolton said, We know exactly what the risks are  [North Korea] using negotiations to drag out the length of time they have to continue their nuclear, chemical, biological weapons programs and ballistic missiles.\nPresident Donald Trump met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore on June 12 to discuss denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and other issues. After the meeting, the two leaders released a statement saying Trump committed to provide security guarantees to North Korea, and Kim reaffirmed his firm and unwavering commitment to complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.\nOn Fox News Channels Sunday Morning Futures with Maria Bartiromo, Trump said of Kim, I made a deal with him. I shook hands with him. I really believe he means it.\nBolton said, \"There's nobody involved in this discussion with North Korea in the administration who is overburdened by navet. We've seen how the North Koreans have behaved before. The President's been very clear. He is not going to make the mistakes of prior administrations. We are going to pursue this, and we will see what happens.\"\nBolton also said Sunday on \"Face the Nation\" that were going to try and proceed to implement what the two leaders agreed to in Singapore. He said, Kim Jong Un was very emphatic several times in Singapore; he was different from prior regimes. He added, \"Now, we'll let their actions speak for themselves.\nSources: AP, CBS News, CNN, Fox News, Politico, Reuters, The Washington Post",

      "Content": "On Wednesday, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that requiring non-union employees to pay public sector labor union fees for collective bargaining violated First Amendment rights. In the case, Mark Janus, an Illinois public-sector employee, argued positions that unions take during collective bargaining with the government are inherently political. He argued that under the First Amendment, he should not be required to support the political activity of collective bargaining by paying for labor union fees, and the court agreed in a 5-4 decision.\nIn the case, titled Janus v. American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, Council 31, the court overturned a 1977 ruling on Abood v. Detroit Board of Education. The Abood ruling had allowed the requirement of non-union members to pay fees for issues such as employee grievances, physical safety and training while not allowing the requirement of fees for a unions political activities such as paying for political advertisements. The court said the Abood ruling was unworkable due to vagueness. Justice Elena Kagan said in her dissenting opinion that it has proved workable and no recent developments have eroded its underpinnings.\nMajority and dissenting opinions\nJustice Samuel Alito wrote in the majority opinion, \"It is hard to estimate how many billions of dollars have been taken from nonmembers and transferred to public-sector unions in violation of the First Amendment. Those unconstitutional exactions cannot be allowed to continue indefinitely.\n\"We recognize that the loss of payments from nonmembers may cause unions to experience unpleasant transition costs in the short term, and may require unions to make adjustments in order to attract and retain members, Alito wrote. But we must weigh these disadvantages against the considerable windfall that unions have received under Abood for the past 41 years.\"\nKagan wrote in her dissent, \"The First Amendment was meant for better things. It was meant not to undermine but to protect democratic governanceincluding over the role of public-sector unions.\"\nWednesdays ruling was supported by Justices appointed by Republican presidents and opposed by Justices appointed by Democratic presidents. In the majority were Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Anthony Kennedy, Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch. Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan dissented. \nEffects of the ruling\nThe Illinois law considered by the court required government workers who did not join a union to pay their proportionate share of the costs of the collective bargaining process, contract administration and pursuing matters affecting wages, hours and other conditions of employment. More than 20 states currently have laws that allow unions to require non-union members to pay for collective bargaining, according to The New York Times. With the ruling, those laws would not apply for public-sector unions.\nIn the majority opinion, the court cited an opinion in a 2014 Supreme Court case that said, In the public sector, core issues such as wages, pensions, and benefits are important political issues, but that is generally not so in the private sector. The ruling should not generally apply to private sector unions.\nIn 2017, 34.4 percent of public-sector workers were in unions and 6.5 percent of private-sector workers were in unions, according to the Bureau of Labor and Statistics. \nSources: CNN, The New York Times, U.S. Supreme Court",

      "Content": "President Donald Trumps election campaign included promises to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, impose a temporary moratorium on Muslims entering the country and change other immigration policies. Below is a timeline of the Trump administrations immigration-related actions to date, as well as corresponding court cases and media reports.\n2017\nJan. 25: Five days after his inauguration, Trump signs two executive orders relating to immigration. One order prevents sanctuary cities, which are cities that do not comply with requests from federal immigration officials, from being eligible for federal funding. The order also prioritizes the deportation of immigrants who have been charged with or convicted of a criminal offense. (This policy is later ruled unenforceable in federal court.) The second order calls for construction of a physical wall on the southern border, monitored and supported by adequate personnel.\nJan. 27: Trump signs an executive order suspending the countrys refugee admission program for 120 days, limiting the total number of refugees to be admitted to the U.S. in 2017 to fewer than 50,000, and completely suspending the admission of refugees from Syria. The order also prohibits people from Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen from entering the U.S. for at least 90 days, citing protection against foreign terrorists as reasoning.\nFeb. 3: Judge James Robart of the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington issues a temporary restraining order against enforcement of the Jan. 27 executive order nationwide. Robart rules that the order adversely affects the states residents in areas of employment, business, education, family relations and freedom to travel.\nFeb. 9: A three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously upholds Robarts ruling. The panel says the Trump administration didnt provide evidence that people from the listed countries perpetrated a terrorist act in the U.S.\nMarch 6: Trump signs a new executive order temporarily suspending immigration and travel by nationals Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen for 90 days, again citing the need to protect the U.S. from terrorist activities by foreign nationals.\nMarch 15: U.S. District Court Judge Derrick Watson in Hawaii blocks the March 6 executive order before it is scheduled to take effect. Watson agrees with the Ninth Circuit ruling on the earlier order.\nMarch 20: The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) issues its first weekly Declined Detainer Outcome Report. The report lists jurisdictions that choose not to cooperate with Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detainers or requests for notification on undocumented immigrants who have been arrested on local criminal charges or who are in local custody.\nApril 18: Trump signs the Buy American, Hire American executive order, which, among other things, directs officials to develop new regulations to prevent alleged fraud or abuse of the U.S. immigration system. The order also directs the officials to suggest reforms to help ensure that H-1B travel visas are awarded to the most-skilled or highest-paid petition beneficiaries.\nJune 15: DHS Secretary John Kelly rescinds the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans (DAPA) policy, which was used to defer deportation of certain undocumented parents of U.S. citizens if they had been in the U.S. since January 2010. Kelly says there is no credible path forward to litigate the policy, which had been litigated by the state of Texas prior to Trumps inauguration. The policy was placed on hold in 2015 by a federal court in Texas and had never been implemented.\nJune 26: The U.S. Supreme Court allows enforcement of a limited version of the March executive order restricting travel, after federal courts had stayed the order. The Supreme Court rules it can be enforced on people with no bona fide tie to the U.S., such as people with family in the U.S. or attending school.\nJuly 25: U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions announces that localities receiving Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance grants from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) would need to 1) allow federal immigration officials access to local corrections facilities to question prisoners about their immigration status, and 2) provide DHS with at least 48 hours notice prior to releasing undocumented immigrants. The grants are a main source of funding for local law enforcement and judicial programs.\nSept. 5: Sessions announces plans to rescind the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program by March 5, 2018. Started in 2012, DACA allowed certain people who were illegally brought into the U.S. as minors to receive two-year renewable work permits, drivers licenses and education funding. (Several individuals and advocacy groups then sue the Trump administration for rescinding DACA, resulting in several injunctions and appeals.)\nSept. 18: Secretary of State Rex Tillerson sends a memo to U.S. embassies changing visa guidelines. According to the memo, people who obtain a visa for the U.S. must adhere to their stated reasons for entering the U.S. for three months instead of the previous period of one month. If they do something not mentioned in the visa application, such as get a job or get married, the U.S. would presumed they have lied, potentially prohibiting them from receiving another visa to enter the U.S.\nSept. 24: Trump signs a new executive order that restricts or limits the entry of people from Chad, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Syria, Venezuela and Yemen. The administration says the countries have inadequate identity-management protocols, information-sharing practices and risk factors.\nNov. 20: Acting DHS Secretary Elaine Duke announces the termination of the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) designation for Haitians living and working in the U.S. as a result of Haitis 2010 earthquake. Haitians have until July 22, 2018, to return to the island or apply for lawful immigration status, if eligible. The government cites improvements to the country since the earthquake as the reason for terminating TPS.\n2018\nJan. 8: DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen announces the termination of the TPS for Salvadorans living and working in the U.S. since El Salvadors 2001 earthquake. Salvadorans have until Sept. 9, 2019, to return to their country or apply for lawful immigration status, if eligible. Nielsen says since the original conditions caused by the 2001 earthquakes no longer exist, TPS for Salvadorans must be terminated.\nApril 2: The DOJ sends a memo to immigration judges saying they must close at least 700 immigration cases a year. It is the first time the DOJ places a quota on immigration judges.\nApril 6: Sessions announces a new zero-tolerance policy for illegal entry into the U.S. Sessions says anyone entering the U.S. illegally will be met with the full prosecutorial powers of the Department of Justice, and that as a result children will be separated from parents found illegally crossing the border. \nApril 19: The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh District upholds a previous court decision that placed an injunction on Sessions rule regarding the distribution of Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance grants.\nApril 20: The New York Times reports that the Trump administration has separated more than 700 immigrant children from adults claiming to be their parents since October, including more than 100 children under the age of 4. The children had reportedly been taken from their parents after crossing the U.S. border.\nApril 24: District Court Judge John Bates rules in favor of people representing the rights of DACA recipients. As a result of the ruling, the U.S. Immigration and Citizenship Services (USCIS) once again accepts first-time applications for DACA, as well as DACA renewals.\nMay 7: Sessions announces that DHS will refer 100 percent of illegal crossings along the U.S.-Mexico border to the DOJ for prosecution. Sessions also says there will be a 50 percent increase in the number of immigration judges to handle asylum claims.\nMay 23: A U.S. Customs and Border Patrol official testifies before the Senate Judiciary Committee that 638 adults who arrived at the border with 658 children have been prosecuted in the two weeks since Sessions announced the administrations zero-tolerance policy.\nJune 8: Reuters reports that about 1,800 immigrant families were separated at the U.S.-Mexico border from October 2016 through February 2018.\nJune 11: Sessions says that asylum claims pertaining to domestic violence or gang violence perpetrated by non-governmental actors will not qualify for asylum, in accordance with specific requirements outlined in immigration law.\nJune 15: A DHS spokesperson says 1,995 minors were separated from their guardians from April 19 through May 31.\nJune 20: Trump signs an executive order ending the separation of families from minor children during immigration court proceedings. He says that zero-tolerance policy remains in place. \nJune 26: The U.S. Supreme Court rules 5-4 that Trumps temporary ban on travel from people living in certain countries is squarely within the scope of presidential authority under federal law.\nIn a separate case, Judge Dana Sabraw in California rules that migrant families separated at the border must be reunited. The judge rules that the administration must reunite children under the age of 5 with family within 14 days, and children older than five within 30 days.\nJuly 12: Two days after Judge Sabraws deadline passes, the Trump administration says it has reunited 58 families with children under 5.\nJuly 24: The Trump administration announces that is has reunited 1,012 families that were separated at the border as a result of its immigration policy.\nAug. 1: In a 2-1 decision, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed with a lower court decision to strike down Trumps January 2017 executive order that restricted certain federal grant money from going to sanctuary cities. The court says Congress has control over U.S. federal spending, including federal grants, not the president.\nAug. 30: According to court documents, at least 497 migrant children remain separated from their legal guardians. The government estimates that 322 parents of those children have already been deported or otherwise removed from the U.S.\nSept. 17: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo says the U.S. will limit the number of refugees annually entering the country to 30,000. A year prior, the Trump administration had suggested lowering the refugee cap to 45,000. During the Obama administration, the annual refugee intake cap was 110,000, according to Politico.\nSept. 18: Sessions announces that immigration judges cannot use their discretion to dismiss cases, such as on sympathetic grounds; they may only terminate cases under certain defined circumstances.\nOct. 3: A federal judge in California grants an injunction to temporarily stop the Trump administration from ending TPS for more than 300,000 immigrants in the U.S. from El Salvador, Haiti, Nicaragua and Sudan. The court orders the injunction to remain in place pending a lawsuit that challenges the administrations revocation of TPS.\n\nSources: Appeals court grant ruling, Ballotpedia, Border wall EO, BJA, CNN, Chicago Tribune, DACA rulings, DAPA, DHS on DACA, DHS report, El Salvador TPS, Family separation EO, Family separation ruling, Family separation update, Haiti TPS, Hire American EO, ICE DAPA, DOJ grant announcement, Ninth Circuit ruling, PBS, Politico, Refugee cap announcement, Reuters, Robart ruling, Sanctuary City EO, Sessions asylum claims, Sessions DACA announcement, Sessions May announcement, Supreme Court 2017, Supreme Court 2018, Texas v US - DAPA, The New York Times, Travel ban 1 EO, Travel ban 2 EO, Travel ban 3 EO, Watson ruling, Zero-tolerance announcement",

      "Content": "On Tuesday, Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens (R) announced he would resign, effective June 1. His resignation followed two reports on Greitens behavior released by a special investigative committee in the state House. One report detailed accusations that he mistreated a woman with whom he admitted to having an affair. A second was on allegations he improperly used a charity donor list for political fundraising. He said, I am not perfect, but I have not broken any laws.\nGreitens said the ordeal has been designed to cause an incredible amount of strain on my family. Millions of dollars in mounting legal bills, endless personal attacks designed to cause maximum damage to family and friends. He said he had not committed any offense worthy of this treatment. \nIt's clear for the forces that oppose us, there's no end in sight, Greitens said. I cannot allow those forces to continue to cause pain and difficulty to the people that I love. He also said he will always be a fighter for the people of Missouri.\nIn January, the woman who he had an affair with in 2015 said he had taken a nude photo of her without her permission and said he would release it publicly if she told anyone about the affair. A St. Louis grand jury indicted him in February on a felony count of invasion of privacy. The St. Louis prosecutor later dropped the charge.\nIn April, Greitens was charged with a second felony, computer tampering, relating to his allegedly using a charity donor list for political purposes before the 2016 election. Greitens denied any criminal wrongdoing.\nGreitens, 44, is a former Navy SEAL who became governor of Missouri in January 2017. Mike Parson, 63, a Republican who became lieutenant governor in 2017, will take over as governor to serve out Greitens term until 2021.\nSources: ABC News, The Kansas City Star 1, The Kansas City Star 2",

      "Content": "The U.S. Justice Department (DOJ) recently announced plans to appeal a federal court ruling preventing the Trump administration from ending the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program (DACA). The DOJ also said it plans to file a petition with the Supreme Court for a direct review of the ruling.\nFor those wondering what DACA is and why its being litigated, weve compiled a rundown below.\nWhat is DACA?\nDACA is a policy that outlines how U.S. authorities should treat the immigration status of people who were illegally brought into the country as minors. It started in 2012 when then-Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano issued a letter to immigration and customs officials advising them as to how to handle certain young people who were brought to this country as children and know only this country as home. Napolitano noted that, since the children were minors when they entered the U.S., they lacked the intent to violate immigration law.\nUnder the direction of Homeland Security, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) began accepting requests for consideration of deferred action for childhood arrivals. USCIS noted that it would consider requests on a case-by-case basis, and applicants had to meet the following criteria:\n\n\tEntered the United States before reaching their 16th birthday.\n\tHave continuously resided in the United States since June 15, 2007, up to the present time.\n\tWere under the age of 31 as of June 15, 2012.\n\tEntered the country without inspection before June 15, 2012, or had no lawful immigration status as of June 15, 2012.\n\tAre currently in school, have graduated or obtained a certificate of completion from high school, have obtained a general educational development certification, or are an honorably discharged veteran of the Coast Guard or Armed Forces of the United States.\n\tHave not been convicted of a felony, significant misdemeanor, or three or more misdemeanors, and do not otherwise pose a threat.\n\tWere present in the United States on June 15, 2012, and at the time of making a request for consideration of deferred action with USCIS.\n\nApplicants who meet the criteria could receive two-year renewable work permits. Under DACA, they can also obtaindrivers licenses, enroll in college and and receive scholarships, join the U.S. military, legally work and pay taxes.\nHow many people does DACA affect?\nAccording to USCIS figures from Sept. 4, 2017, about 690,000 unauthorized immigrants are currently enrolled in the DACA program. About 66 percent of enrollees are 25 years old or younger. DACA has granted work permits and other benefits to approximately 800,000 undocumented immigrants since 2012.\nThe DACA program may also affect U.S. tax revenue. A 2016 study by Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy estimated that undocumented immigrants, including those who qualify for DACA, collectively pay an estimated $11.64 billion a year in state and local taxes.\nHow does DACA relate to the DREAM Act?\nDACA was enacted in 2012 after Congress did not pass the Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors Act (DREAM Act) for a seventh time the year before. The DREAM Act would have allowed certain undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children to apply for temporary legal status and eventually obtain permanent legal status or U.S. citizenship if they first go to college or serve in the U.S. military. \nWhile DACA allows eligible immigrant children to work, attend college and join the military, it doesnt provide a path to citizenship. Former President Obama described DACA as a temporary stopgap measure intended to give Congress time to pass the DREAM Act.\nThe DREAM Act has been introduced in the Senate at least seven times since 2001. It was first introduced by Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah); he introduced it again in 2003. Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) introduced his version at least four times: once in 2005, and again in 2007, 2010 and 2011. And Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) introduced a version in July 2017. None of the bills have made it past the introduced stage, which means they were never voted on by the full Senate or House of Representatives.\nCan DACA recipients apply for citizenship?\nAccording to Immigration lawyer Hadley Bajramovic, since DACA is not an immigrant visa, recipients cant automatically gain a Legal Permanent Residency (LPR) / Green Card. Undocumented immigrants living in the United States are not eligible to apply for an immigrant visa without the penalty of being barred from the United States for 3 to 10 years. \nImmigrants typically have to apply for a visa prior to entering the U.S. or after entering the U.S. legally, which is something DACA recipients may not have been able to do if they entered illegally as children. However, DACA recipients may request that a qualified relative living in the U.S. petition for them to obtain a visa, or marry a U.S. citizen.\nHow did we get here?\nHere is a brief timeline of DACA-related events:\nMay 11, 2011: Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) introduces the Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors Act (DREAM Act) for a fourth time. As with previous attempts, the Act doesnt move past the introductory stage of legislation.\nJune 15, 2012: Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano issues a letter to immigration and customs officials outlining the policy later known as the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA).\nJune 29, 2017: A group of Republican state officials from 10 states request that the Trump Administration rescind DACA by Sept. 5 in exchange for dropping a lawsuit currently pending against the government.\nSept. 5, 2017: U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions announces that the DACA program is being rescinded. Sessions said the Trump administration will stop considering new applications for legal status. Any DACA recipients with a permit set to expire before March 5, 2018 can apply for a two-year renewal if they renew by Oct. 5, 2017.\nSept. 6, 2017: A group of 15 U.S. states and the District of Columbia file a lawsuit against the Trump administration for its decision to end DACA.\nSept. 11, 2017: The state of California files a lawsuit against the Trump administration for its decision to rescind DACA.\nJan. 9, 2018: San Francisco-based Federal District Judge William Alsup rules that the Trump administration must continue accepting DACA renewals nationwide, but it does not need to receive or process new applications.\nJan. 16, 2018: The U.S. Justice Department announces plans to appeal Judge Alsups ruling.",

The government said exploration could continue with permits that it had already issued. Referring to climate change, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said, We are committed to the goal of becoming a net zero emissions economy by 2050. She said her goal is for all of the electricity New Zealand uses to come from renewable energy sources by 2035. \nThe Petroleum Exploration and Production Association of New Zealand said the governments decision is a lose-lose for New Zealands economy and environment, likely to threaten jobs and would mean higher prices for consumers. It also said the move would mean other countries will produce [oil] instead and we will have to import it at higher cost. It added that more than 11,000 people work in the oil and gas industries during peak times, and that jobs would be affected given that companies had made huge investments anticipating offshore block offers, which would not be made under the governments announcement. \nThe government said the oil industry should pursue other opportunities in energy, such as the mining of solar cell materials, CNN reported.\nArdern said, There are 31 oil and gas exploration permits currently active, 22 are offshore. She said these permits run as far out as 2030 and could go an additional 40 years under a mining permit.\nNew Zealand exports about $1.1 billion worth of oil per year, less than it imports, according to The New York Times. About 80 percent of the energy for New Zealands 4.7 million people currently comes from renewable energy sources, according to Bloomberg.\nArdern became prime minister when her Labour Party formed a coalition with the Green and Free Parties after parliamentary elections in September of last year.\nSources: Bloomberg, CNN, The New York Times",

Gillibrand is one of four Democratic senators who have called for Trumps resignation over the allegations.\nRachel Crooks, Jessica Leeds and Samantha Holvey gave an interview to NBC News Megyn Kelly, and the fourth woman, Lisa Boyne, joined them later at a press conference in New York City. During the press conference, Crooks said, I ask Congress to put aside their party affiliations and ask that they investigate Trumps history of sexual misconduct, adding that if Congress was willing to investigate Senator Franken, I think it's only fair that they do the same for Trump.\" Crooks also said, In terms of resigning, its probably the right thing to do. But I cant imagine he will. I think the congressional investigation is the only thing we can ask for.\nSens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) and Cory Booker (D-N.J.) had previously called on Trump to resign after the allegations. In Mondays interview, Gillibrand said that President Trump should resign and that These allegations are credible; they are numerous. Ive heard these womens testimony, and many of them are heartbreaking.\nTrump has been accused of sexual misconduct by at least 16 women, with allegations spanning a period from 1993 until 2017. He has denied all allegations. On Monday, the White House released a statement saying, These false claims, totally disputed in most cases by eyewitness accounts, were addressed at length during last years campaign, and the American people voiced their judgment by delivering a decisive victory.\nSources: Fox News, NBC News",

      "Content": "Facebook announced on Tuesday that it removed accounts, groups and pages engaged in coordinated inauthentic behavior that mislead others about who they were and what they were doing. The social media company said the accounts had originated from separate campaigns in Iran and Russia, adding that it had not found any link or coordination between them. The Iranian and Russian governments denied involvement.\nThe accounts mostly posted political content, including posts and memes about U.S. politics published by some of the Iranian accounts in advance of the 2018 midterm elections. Some accounts also engaged in traditional cybersecurity attacks, including attempts to hack peoples accounts and spread malware, Facebook said, adding that it disrupted the attempts. \nFacebook said it coordinated with law enforcement, security experts and other companies to address the misuse of the platform, and thanked other security companies for their work. The social media company also said it monitored some groups for months before taking actions to close them in order to gather information about how they operate. \nThere is always a tension between taking down these bad actors quickly and improving our defenses over the long term, Facebook said. If we remove them too early, its harder to understand their playbook and the extent of their network. It also limits our ability to coordinate with law enforcement, who often have investigations of their own.\nIran\nAccording to Facebook, the inauthentic posts that originated in Iran targeted people across multiple internet services in the Middle East, Latin America, UK and US. For example, these include political posts critical of Israel, the U.K.s decision to leave the European Union, and U.S. President Donald Trump. \nFacebook removed 652 of these pages, groups and accounts, in both English and Arabic. Collectively, these accounts were followed by at least 983,000 other accounts. Some of the inauthentic accounts also spent more than $12,000 on Facebook and Instagram advertising, paid in U.S. dollars, Australian dollars, Turkish lira, and Indian rupees, Facebook said. The company said it had notified the U.S. departments of Treasury and State to evaluate if any sanctions had been violated. Some of the pages also hosted events. \nA spokesman for the Iranian mission to the United Nations, Alireza Miryousefi, said, such claims are ridiculous and are part and parcel of U.S. public calls for regime change in Iran, and are an abuse of social media platforms. \nRussia\nUnrelated to the posts originating in Iran, Facebook said it removed pages, groups and accounts that can be linked to sources the US government has previously identified as Russian military intelligence services. The content of these accounts focused on politics in Ukraine and Syria, including content supporting Russia and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, Facebook said. \nThe social media company noted that some of the owners of the accounts were also allegedly involved in cybersecurity attacks before the 2016 U.S. election, adding that the more recent activity did not involve U.S.-specific content. Facebook noted it was continuing to work with U.S. law enforcement on the matter.\nIn February, the U.S. indicted 13 Russian and three Russian entities with interfering with the 2016 U.S. election, including alleged use of social media platforms such as Facebook to share political content. \nRussian spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia did not understand the basis of Facebooks accusations, adding that they seemed like a carbon copy of allegations Russia already denied. \n\nSources: DOJ, Facebook News, Reuters",

      "Content": "The war in Syria has affected millions of civilians since the conflict began in 2011. More than 400,000 civilians and fighters have been killed, according to World Bank estimates. \nMore than 5.6 million people have left the country to seek refuge elsewhere, and more than 6.6 million have been internally displaced (i.e. they moved to avoid the fighting but stayed within Syria), according to the U.N. refugee agency (UNHCR). Additionally, 13 million people in the country require humanitarian aid, including 6 million children, according to the U.N. \nFighting began in March 2011, after government forces fired on Arab Spring protestors in the Syrian city of Daraa, killing four people. Protests were held in several cities in Syria, and security forces started to arrest protestors and respond violently. The fighting evolved into a civil war. \nThe war is complex, with multiple military and paramilitary groups fighting: Syrian President Bashar Assads government is fighting various groups opposed to his government, and there are other groups fighting both the government and rebel forces. (For more, read our context Syrian War fighters and backers explained.) Seven-and-a-half years into the war, fighting continues in some areas and there have been many developments.\nBelow is an abridged list of major developments in the war so far in 2018 (see map below to reference locations):\nJan. 5: Russian airstrikes reportedly kill 25 civilians in eastern Ghouta, a rebel-held area in Rif Dimashq province. Eastern Ghouta is located just east of Damascus and encompasses the town of Douma.\nJan. 20: Turkish government forces enter Syria to fight the YPG, an armed Syrian-based Kurdish group, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoan announces. The YPG has controlled the city of Afrin and surrounding areas in the Aleppo province since 2012. Turkey considers the YPG to be a terrorist group. \nFeb. 1: An alleged chemical attack occurs in eastern Ghouta. The incident is the third suspected chemical attack by Assads forces in 2018, according to the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). \nFeb. 4: Another suspected government chemical attack is carried out in the town of Saraqib in Idlib province, USAID reports. \nFeb. 4-9: Syrian-led airstrikes on eastern Ghouta reportedly kill at least 230 civilians, according to the U.N. On Feb. 10, U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Raad Al Hussein calls for international response. \nFeb. 18: Assads forces begin a new, intensified offensive in eastern Ghouta, referred to as the Rif Dimashq offensive. Hundreds of civilians are reportedly killed in the period that follows.\nFeb 22: YPG forces (and their all-female counterparts YPJ) leave northern Aleppo areas to defend Afrin; Syrian government forces take over neighborhoods in northern Aleppo.\nFeb. 24: The U.N. Security Council unanimously passes a resolution for a 30-day ceasefire to allow for the delivery of humanitarian aid to millions of people.\nMarch 15: The war enters its eighth year. Also, in the largest single-day displacement, an estimated 42,000 civilians leave eastern Ghouta. \nMarch 29: U.S. President Donald Trump says that the U.S. would leave Syria very soon, without giving a timetable. \nApril 4: A peace summit with the presidents of Turkey, Iran and Russia is held in the Turkish capital of Ankara. The next round of talks is scheduled for May 14. \nApril 7: An alleged chemical weapons attack kills at least 41 civilians in the town of Douma, 12 miles (20 km) from the capital city of Damascus. The U.S., EU, Turkey, rebel groups and others attribute the attack to Assads government. Assad denies responsibility, and Russia says the evidence was fabricated. (Assad later invites international inspectors to investigate, and then denies access.)\nApril 13: U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres speaks to the Security Council, saying, there is no military solution to the conflict.\nApril 14: The U.S., U.K. and France launch precision strikes on targets associated with the chemical weapon capabilities of Assads government, U.S. President Donald Trump announces. (The U.S. previously launched 59 missiles on Syrian targets in 2017 after an alleged chemical attack by Assads forces.) \nAlso April 14: Syria declares it has removed the remaining militants from eastern Ghouta. All the terrorists have left Douma city, their last bastion in eastern Ghouta, the Syrian statement said.\nMay 16: Syrian government forces announce they have retaken 4,600 square miles (12,000 sq km) of territory from rebels in areas near southern Homs and northern Hama.\nMay 21: Syria announces it has removed the remaining Islamic State (IS) fighters from south Damascus; for the first time in seven years, no more military operations are taking place in the capital. \nJuly 12: U.S. says it may have launched airstrikes that killed at least 54 civilians in Deir ez-Zor province. The strikes reportedly were intended to hit IS targets. \nAug. 30: Russian airstrikes in Idlib province reportedly kill four people. The Syrian government has reportedly sent tens of thousands of armed troops and deployed more than 2,000 armored vehicles to the area in recent weeks, according to the U.K.-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR). The U.N. has said a full-scale military operation on Idlib could risk a humanitarian catastrophe.\nAug 31: Militant groups in Syria blow up two bridges that link areas they control to government-held territories in the northwestern al-Ghab plains area, near Hama. The SOHR reports that this is a response to increased Syrian military presence in Idlib. \nSept. 4: The U.N. Special Envoy for Syria offers to escort residents of Idlib province to safety before the Syrian government launches an attack on militant groups controlling the region. The U.N.s Staffan de Mistura says the northwestern province has about 10,000 members of al-Nusra, an al-Qaida-linked group, which the U.N. has labeled as terrorists.\nSept. 17: Russias and Turkeys presidents announce an agreement to establish a demilitarized zone in Idlib Province that would be monitored by both Turkish and Russian forces. \nMap of Syrian provinces\n\nNote: Ghouta refers to the region surrounding the capital, Damascus, and is part of Rif Dimashq province. Eastern Ghouta is located just east of Damascus and encompasses the town of Douma.\n\nSources: AP, BBC, BBC, CNBC, CNN, Dohain Institute, EU Statement of Douma, Reuters, Reuters, Rudaw, Syria Liveuamap, SOHR, SOHR, SOHR, SOHR, UNHCR, UNHCR Press, UN News - Syria, UN News - Idlib, UN Press Release - Ceasefire, UPI, USAID, White House, World Bank, World Vision",

      "Content": "On Wednesday, Israel passed a law that grants the minister of the interior the authority to revoke the permanent residency status of Palestinians in Jerusalem on the grounds of a \"breach of trust\" with the country. Under the law, the minister also has the power to revoke residency if it was obtained on false information or if the minister determines the individual to have committed a criminal act. The ministers decision can be appealed.\nUnder the law, Palestinians considered to have committed a \"breach of trust\" could include would-be attackers, those having connections to terrorist groups, and those convicted of terrorism or treason, according to The Times of Israel. \nThe law reportedly applies to Palestinians in East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights. The Times of Israel wrote that the law appears to apply only to residents of East Jerusalem who have had permanent residency for more than 15 years or who had a parent with permanent residency.\nThe law passed after the Israeli High Court of Justice ruled in September that the interior ministry did not have the right to revoke residency status on the grounds of a \"breach of trust as it had done ten years ago for four Palestinians with connections to Hamas. Hamas is considered a terrorist group by Israel and other countries, including the U.S. The High Court suspended the implementation of the ruling until March of this year.\nIsraeli Interior Minister Aryeh Deri tweeted that the law would enable him to \"maintain the security of Israeli citizens.\"\nAdalah, a Palestinian rights group based in Israel, alleged that the law is illegal under international humanitarian law. \nPalestinians who are born and live in Jerusalem do not hold Israeli citizenship, Al Jazeera reported. The government issues them \"permanent residency\" identification cards. About 420,000 Palestinians live in East Jerusalem. Israel has revoked the residency status of at least 14,000 Palestinians since 1967, according to the outlet.\nThe U.S. recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel in December. The only other country to recognize Jerusalem in this way is Russia, Al Jazeera reported.\nSources: Al Jazeera, The Times of Israel",

      "Content": "The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said Wednesday it would require inspections of some CFM56-7B engines, like the one that failed on Tuesdays Southwest Airlines flight, killing one passenger. Engines with more than a certain number of flights would require ultrasonic inspection of fan blades, and any blades that fail inspection would require replacement. Authorities said their preliminary investigation indicated a fan blade broke off during flight, as one had done on a 2016 Southwest flight that landed safely in Florida.\nOn Wednesday evening, the FAA tweeted that it will issue an Airworthiness Directive (AD) within the next two weeks that will require inspections of certain CFM56-7B engines. The directive will require an ultrasonic inspection of fan blades when they reach a certain number of takeoffs and landings. Any blades that fail the inspection will have to be replaced.\nAfter the 2016 incident, the FAA recommended inspections of some CFM engines.\nBased on its forthcoming requirement of having engines tested after a certain number of flights, the FAA estimated that 220 CFM56-7B engines would have been required to be tested last year. It did not say how many would require inspection this year.\nOther airlines, including United, American Airlines and Delta Air Lines said Wednesday they had begun inspections on some of the CFM56-78B engines used on their aircraft.\nTuesdays accident involved pieces of the Southwest flights engine hitting and breaking a plane window. Jennifer Riordan, a mother of two, was partially drawn out of the window and died from blunt impact trauma to the head, neck and torso, Philadelphias medical examiner said Wednesday.\nInvestigators said Wednesday that for a few seconds after the engine failed, the aircraft rolled to an angle of 41 degrees, and then levelled out. The pilot, Tammy Jo Shults, was able to safely land the plane in Philadelphia and, other than Riordan, seven people aboard had minor injuries.\nSources: BBC, The Washington Post",

Mike Rogers, said he has not been granted additional authorities to take measures to deter Russian cyber interference efforts at the origin of the alleged attacks. That authority would need to be granted by U.S. President Donald Trump through Defense Secretary James Mattis. Rogers said he had not requested more authority. \nIve never been given any specific direction to take additional steps outside my authority, said Rogers, who also heads the National Security Agency (NSA). He said there are some things he has the authority to do and he is acting on that authority. He told the questioning senator that he could go into more detail in a classified setting. \nWhen asked about whether economic deterrents, such as sanctions, are effective as part of the effort to address cybersecurity threats, Rogers replied he thought they were positive. He said he believed Russia had not paid a price that is sufficient to change its behavior over alleged cyber interference efforts in American elections.\nAt a White House press briefing, Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders was asked why Rogers had not been granted additional authority to confront alleged Russian cyber interference in the U.S. Sanders said the Secretary of Homeland Security had met with a number of both state, local, and federal officials working on ways that we can best prevent things like this in the future.\nIn a written statement, Rogers said that U.S. Cyber Command has an operating budget of more than $600 million this fiscal year and a full-time staff of 1,060. At the end of last year, 5,070 people, civilians and members of the military worked for the Cyber Mission Force. \nWatch the full Cyber Command hearing here.\nRecent updates on alleged Russian cyber interference\nTwo weeks ago, Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats testified at a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing that there should be no doubt that Russia perceived its past efforts as successful. He alleged that Russia views the 2018 U.S. midterm elections as a potential target for Russian midterm operations.\nLast week, Special Counsel Robert Mueller indicted 13 Russians and three Russian companies for alleged interference in the 2016 presidential election. \nCongress authorized new sanctions against Russia in August of last year, for Russias annexation of Crimea in 2014, its ongoing military actions in eastern Ukraine and its alleged interference in the 2016 presidential election. Trump delayed the implementation of new sanctions against Russia in January of this year.\n\n \n Sources: AP, CNN, NBC News, The Guardian\n",

      "Content": "On Tuesday, President Donald Trump pardoned two Oregon cattle ranchers who had been in prison for setting fire to public land. Dwight Hammond Jr., 76, and his son Steven Hammond, 49, were convicted in 2012 of arson on Harney County land adjacent to their ranch. They were originally sentenced to less than the federally-mandated minimum of five years; they were re-sentenced in 2015 to a total served time of five years each, which the White House described as unjust.\nDwight and Steven Hammond were convicted of setting a fire in 2001 and Steven was convicted of setting a second fire in 2006. Dwight had set a prescribed burn on about 300 acres of his land as a means to stop invasive species, according to his lawyers. The fire spread to federal land where it burned about 139 acres. Prosecutors alleged the fire was also set to destroy evidence of illegal deer poaching, and that firefighters were endangered by the fire and some needed to be airlifted to safety.\nU.S. District Judge Michael R. Hogan initially did not apply the five-year minimum sentence for arson mandated under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996. He said a five-year sentence would not meet any idea I have of justice, proportionality ... it would be a sentence which would shock the conscience to me. Hogan sentenced Dwight to three months in prison and Steven to a year and a day.\nThe Department of Justice appealed the sentence, and in October 2015, a federal appeals court ordered that the Hammonds be re-sentenced to the mandatory minimum, accounting for time already served. In protest of the resentencing, armed citizens occupied the federal refuge near the Hammonds farm for 41 days. The Hammonds were returned to prison in 2016 to complete five-year sentences. \nAs of July, Dwight has served two years and nine months in prison and Steven three years and four months. The two were being held in a federal detention center south of Los Angeles. The White House did not say when they would be released.\nThe pardon\nWhite House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said federal prosecutors in the case had filed an overzealous appeal and that the resulting five-year prison sentence for the Hammonds was unjust. She also said, The evidence at trial regarding the Hammonds responsibility for the fire was conflicting, and the jury acquitted them on most of the charges.\nThe Hammonds are devoted family men, respected contributors to their local community and have widespread support from their neighbors, local law enforcement and farmers and ranchers across the West, Sanders said. Justice is overdue for Dwight and Steven Hammond, both of whom are entirely deserving of these Grants of Executive Clemency.''\nIn their clemency petitions, the Hammonds lawyers cited their service to the community, the severity of the punishment, Judge Hogans support for clemency, and the Hammonds family situation, including difficulties in sustaining their cattle operation due to governments denial of a grazing permit in 2014.\nU.S. Rep. Greg Walden (R-Ore.), Harney County Sheriff Dave Ward, Malheur County Sheriff Brian Wolfe, and leaders of the Oregon Cattlemens Association and Oregon Farm Bureau wrote letters of support for the Hammonds clemency petitions.\nSteven Hammonds attorney, Larry Matasar, wrote, Unlike some cases where clemency may outrage the community, clemency for the Hammonds would be embraced by the Oregon community, both rural and urban. \nOccupation of the wildlife refuge\nFollowing the Hammonds re-sentencing in 2015, dozens of armed people occupied the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge that borders the Hammond family ranch in southeastern Oregon for 41 days. Two sons of a Nevada rancher, Cliven Bundy, led the occupation, and one of the sons, Ammon Bundy, cited the Hammond case as a reason for it. He said the federal government had a limited right to own property in the state, according to The Associated Press. \nThe occupation ended after Oregon State Police shot dead one of the occupiers, LaVoy Finicum, and Ammon and Ryan Bundy were arrested. In 2016, a federal court jury in Portland acquitted the Bundy brothers and five other defendants of charges related to the occupation.\nResponses to the pardons\nWalden, the congressman who advocated granting the pardon, said, \"Today is a win for justice and an acknowledgement of our unique way of life in the high desert, rural West. He added, \"I applaud President Trump for thoroughly reviewing the facts of this case, rightly determining the Hammonds were treated unfairly and taking action to correct this injustice.''\nAmanda Marshall, Oregons U.S. attorney at the time of the appeal, said the pardons, as opposed to commuting their sentences, means their conviction does not exist. I find that incredibly troubling Marshall said. I think it's a slap in the face to the people in Pendleton who served on that jury and a slap in the face to the Constitution.'\nMarshall said Judge Hogan issuing shorter sentences than mandated by Congress violated the law. She also noted the Hammonds could have been sentenced to less than a year in prison under a plea offer they did not accept.\nThe president of the non-profit group Defenders of Wildlife, Jamie Rappaport Clark, said he hoped the pardon was not seen as an encouragement to those who might use violence to seize federal property and threaten federal employees.\nRyan Bundy, one of the leaders of the wildlife refuge occupation, called the pardon long overdue. \nSources: AP, HuffPost, The Daily Caller, The Oregonian, The White House",

The policy calls for 100 percent of adults found illegally crossing the border to be charged with federal crimes under 8 U.S.C.  1325(a). Sessions said Thursday that if adults go to a U.S. port of entry to claim asylum, they are not prosecuted and the family stays intact pending the legal process.\nIf you are smuggling a child, then we will prosecute you and that child will be separated from you as required by law, Sessions said on May 7. Children are prohibited from being put in criminal jails, according to The Washington Post.\n \nMinors are then processed as unaccompanied minors through the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). They can be housed in government facilities, placed in temporary foster care or released to sponsors in the U.S. The DHS said it does not separate infants from adults. It did not provide the ages of minors who are separated from adults. On Thursday, Sessions said that while in HHS custody, children are provided with food, education in their native language, and health and dental care.\nParents or guardians who are separated from children can phone an Immigration and Customs Enforcement department (ICE) hotline or an Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) hotline for information, or to set up lines of communication with children in government custody, according to an ICE flyer. \nOn Friday, a DHS representative told reporters that prosecutions for illegal crossings at the border had more than doubled since Sessions announced the zero-tolerance policy, adding that it is not currently prosecuting 100 percent of cases. We make decisions based on the ability to detain and the ability of courts to take these cases, but we no longer exempt categories or classes of individuals, the representative said. \nAdvocates want us to ignore the law and give people with families a free pass, said the DHS official, who declined to be named. We no longer exempt entire classes of people.\nReuters reported that 1,800 separations of minors and adults crossing the border took place between October 2016 and February 2018. Adults may be separated from children traveling with them if officials suspect the relationship is fraudulent. Reuters reported approximately 13 percent of separations during this period were due to alleged fraud.\nTrumps tweets\nLast Friday afternoon, President Donald Trump tweeted, The Democrats are forcing the breakup of families at the Border with their horrible and cruel legislative agenda.

      "Content": "Students from schools across the U.S. participated in walkouts protesting gun violence on Friday, the anniversary of the Columbine mass shooting. More than 2,500 schools were estimated to participate, according to organizers of the National School Walkout. \n \n Lane Murdock, a sophomore high school student from Ridgefield High School in Connecticut, organized the protests. Murdock said she organized the demonstration in response to the Parkland shooting, in which a gunman killed 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, on Feb. 14 of this year. \nStudents in the walkouts are protesting congressional, state, and local failures to take action to prevent gun violence, according to the organizers website. The National School Walkout has three stated goals: to hold elected officials accountable, to promote solutions to gun violence, and to demystify and engage students in the political system. The groups website does not issue specific legislative demands. \nThe walkouts include a 19-minute silence, one minute to symbolize each year since the Columbine mass shooting. In that shooting, which occurred in Colorado on April 20, 1999, two teenagers killed 12 students and one teacher, and injured 24 others, before killing themselves. \nThe walkouts were smaller in size than the March 24 March for Our Lives protests organized by Parkland students, according to The Washington Post. The Post reported that some school districts were supporting the student walkouts and others, such as Arlington County, would treat students leaving without parental permission as an unexcused absence. \nAn average of ten shootings per year at U.S. schools have occurred since 1999, according to a report by The Washington Post, including targeted shootings, gang violence and mass shootings. The report found at least 130 students, teachers, staff and family members have been killed on school campuses during school hours in that time. \nIn 2017, more than 15,600 people were killed in U.S. shooting incidents, according to non-profit tracking organization Gun Violence Archive. The U.S. has a total population of approximately 325.7 million people. \nFor an exploration of arguments for and against gun control, click here. \nA timeline of mass shootings in the U.S. is available here.\nSources: BBC, CNN, Gun Violence Archive, The Washington Post, The Washington Post",

      "Content": "On Wednesday, the U.S. Veterans Affairs Office of Inspector General (OIG) issued a report on a trip VA Secretary David Shulkin made to Europe last year. The OIG investigated Shulkins 11-day trip to Copenhagen and London in July, after an anonymous complaint of misuse of VA funds. The VA Department paid $4,312 for his wifes airfare; the report said this was the result of Shulkin's chief of staff altering an \"official record email. The report also cited incidents involving Shulkin accepting Wimbledon tickets, and directing a VA employee to coordinate leisure activities on the trip. Shulkin has denied any wrongdoing.\nAbout the email\nAccording to the OIG report, Shulkin's chief of staff, Vivieca Wright Simpson, altered an email she received from a staff member before forwarding it to the VA's ethics office. The email suggested Shulkin would be receiving an award while in the Netherlands. The supposed award was allegedly used to justify the department paying for Shulkin's wife to accompany him as an \"invitational traveler.\" Shulkin did not receive an award in the Netherlands.\nThe OIG concluded that Shulkin did not know about Simpson allegedly altering the email. The office referred Simpson's actions to the Department of Justice (DOJ), saying they \"may have violated federal criminal statutes.\" The DOJ decided not to prosecute at that time, according to the OIG report. Simpson responded to the report in a statement on Wednesday, saying, \"I look forward to inserting facts into the record so it may reflect truth and accuracy and illuminate any further confusion or misrepresentation.\"\nWimbledon tickets\nThe IOG report also said Shulkin accepted two tickets to the Wimbledon tennis tournament from Victoria Gosling. Gosling served as CEO of the 2016 Invictus Games for wounded veterans in Orlando, Florida. Gosling said she spent time there with Shulkin and his wife, Merle Bari, after initially meeting them in 2015. Gosling said she had extra tickets because of a cancellation, and offered them to Shulkin and Bari \"out of friendship.\" \nThe OIG concluded Shulkin had \"improperly accepted Wimbledon tickets.\" Its report said federal ethics rules prohibit the \"acceptance of any gift given because of the employee's official position,\" or if it comes from a \"prohibited source.\" The OIG concluded the tickets were offered due to Shulkins position in the VA. Shulkins lawyers said Gosling offered the tickets due to her personal relationship with Shulkin and Bari. \nThe OIG also said Shulkin did not seek the advice of the VA ethics counsel before accepting the tickets as a gift. Shulkin's lawyers said Gosling was not a \"prohibited source\" because Gosling does not do business or seek to do business with the VA. \nUse of official staff's time\nThe OIG concluded that Shulkin directed a VA employee to coordinate Shulkin's leisure time on the European trip, such as tourist activities with his wife, and that it was a \"misuse\" of that employee's official work time. Shulkin's lawyers said the employee started coordinating the leisure time of his own initiative, and later was referred by Shulkin to his wife for further coordination since Shulkin was \"too busy.\"\nRecommendations and response\nThe OIG's report made recommendations, including a review and enhancement of employee training on \"travel planning, approvals, and the solicitation or acceptance of gifts.\" It also recommended that Shulkin pay for his wife's airfare of $4,312, and for the Wimbledon tickets. Shulkin's office responded that he does not agree with the OIG's conclusions on these two recommendations, and that he will consult with the Office of General Counsel before deciding how to act on them.\nShulkin's attorneys wrote the OIG a 16-page letter in response to a draft of its report. They said the report presented a \"one-sided account\" and omitted \"critical facts\" that \"make clear the Secretary has done nothing wrong.\" \nThe OIG report said that in Copenhagen, Shulkin had meetings related to veterans health issues and the Danish healthcare system. In England, Shulkin attended a London Summit in which mental health issues of veterans were discussed. The entire trip cost the government at least $122,334, according to the OIG.\nSources: ABC News, The Washington Post",

      "Content": "A former Thai navy diver died on Friday during part of the operation to rescue the boys soccer team that is trapped in a cave in Thailand due to flooding. Earlier this week, all 12 boys, aged 11 to 16, and their 25-year-old coach were found alive inside the Tham Luang cave complex, in the Chiang Rai region. The diver, Petty Officer Saman Gunan, had been delivering oxygen to the boys and lost consciousness on the dive out of the cave. His diving partner was unable to revive him. \nHis job was to deliver oxygen. He did not have enough on his way back, said Passakorn Boonyaluck, deputy governor of the Chiang Rai region. Saman, 38, had left the navy, but returned to aid in the operation. The king of Thailand announced he would sponsor the funeral. \nThe soccer team entered the cave when it was dry. It began flooding and the team took shelter on a ledge above water in a cavern about two weeks ago, on June 23. They were found on Monday by a British diving team. Thai and international rescuers have brought food, oxygen and supplies to the team where they are trapped about 2.5 miles (4 km) from the entrance. With the cave flooded, it is about an 11 hour diving journey from the entrance to the boys and back, BBC reported. \nInitially, officials believed the team could remain in the cave until the water levels dropped enough for everyone to walk out, which could be up to four months from now; officials changed their minds due to falling oxygen levels. The oxygen level in the area where the boys are trapped has dropped to about 15 percent, Thai Navy SEAL chief Rear Adm. Aphakorn Yoo-kongkaew said. The usual level is 21 percent, and the decrease poses a risk of hypoxia, which is the same condition that causes altitude sickness. A heavy monsoon is also forecast for Sunday, which could increase the flood levels.\nIn addition to the possibility of bringing the soccer team out with divers, rescue operations are assessing whether the area where the boys are can be reached from above. Thai soldiers and National Park Authority workers traveled about 12 miles (20 km) from the caves main entrance in an attempt to find a suitable area to reach the boys. Rock climbing teams have descended into some holes in the rocks, but have not found a suitable access point yet, CNN reported on Monday morning. \nElon Musk, the CEO of SpaceX and Tesla, also announced on Friday that engineers from SpaceX and The Boring Company would travel to the area to aid the Thai government in the operation. Theyre scheduled to arrive on Saturday. \nSources: BBC, CNBC, CNN, CNN",

      "Content": "The U.S. Supreme Court ruled 5-4 on Tuesday that a provision of a federal law mandating deportation of immigrants convicted of an aggravated felony was unconstitutionally vague. The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) defined an aggravated felony as a crime of violence that carries a prison term of at least one year. A crime of violence is defined as one that involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense, according to the Supreme Court ruling. \nThe case before the court was Sessions v. Dimaya, which involved Philippine-born James Garcia Dimaya, who came to the U.S. in 1992 when he was 13. In 2007 and 2009, while a lawful permanent resident of the U.S., he had pleaded no contest to charges of residential burglary in California. A plea of no contest is often used in a plea bargain, and though technically not an admission of guilt, judges treat it as a guilty plea. In 2010, the U.S. government brought removal proceedings against him, calling the crime he was convicted of an aggravated felony under the INA. An immigration judge ruled he could be removed from the U.S. on this basis. \nDimayas lawyers appealed and the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in his favor that a provision of the INA was unconstitutionally vague under the Fifth Amendments Due Process Clause, which says no person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law. The ruling followed one in 2015 in the Supreme Court, when former Justice Antonin Scalia had written the majority opinion that a provision of the Armed Career Criminal Act was unconstitutionally vague.\nThe U.S., led by Attorney General Jeff Sessions, appealed the Dimaya case to the Supreme Court, where it first ended in a 4-4 tie in January 2017 after Justice Scalias death and prior to Justice Neil Gorsuchs confirmation to the court. On Tuesday, the Supreme Court upheld the lower courts ruling. Justice Gorsuch and Justices Breyer, Ginsburg, Kagan and Sotomayor voted in favor of the ruling; Justices Alito, Kennedy, Roberts and Thomas voted against it.\nSources: CNN, USA Today, U.S. Supreme Court, Legal Dictionary",

They said that Cohen does not have evidence of the conversation, but is willing to attest to the events in court. Trump tweeted that he did not know about the meeting, and suggested that Cohen was making it up in order to get himself out of an unrelated jam.\nThe meeting, which was first reported by The New York Times in July of last year, was to introduce Trump Jr. to someone who had official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary [Clinton] and her dealings with Russia, according to an email invitation Trump Jr. made public last year. \nSpecial Counsel Robert Mueller reportedly asked Trumps legal team about the meeting, according to a list of questions that The New York Times published in April. The Times reported that Mueller, who is leading an investigation into alleged Russian election interference and possible coordination between Russia and Trumps presidential campaign, submitted a question for Trump to his legal team about when he became aware of his sons meeting.\nThe meeting\nThe other parties reportedly present at the June 2016 meeting were: British music publicist Rob Goldstone, who according to a Trump Jr. email chain arranged the meeting; then-Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort; Trumps son-in-law and now senior presidential adviser Jared Kushner; Russian translator Anatoli Samachornov; and Russian-American lobbyist Rinat Akhmetshin.\nTrump Jr. said that, during the meeting, Veselnitskaya spoke about the adoption of Russian children and mentioned the Magnitsky Act, and did not offer information about Clinton. (The U.S. Magnitsky Act imposed sanctions on Russian individuals suspected of human rights violations, and following its imposition, Russia prohibited the adoption of Russian children by American families.) Veselnitskaya said in an interview that she, Trump Jr., and the others discussed nothing at all about the presidential campaign in the meeting. \nTrump tweeted Friday, .....I did NOT know of the meeting with my son, Don jr. Sounds to me like someone is trying to make up stories in order to get himself out of an unrelated jam (Taxi cabs maybe?). He even retained Bill and Crooked Hillarys lawyer. Gee, I wonder if they helped him make the choice!\nCohen under investigation\nCohen, one of Trumps former personal attorneys, is under investigation for his personal business dealings, according to the Justice Department. In April, FBI agents raided his home and office, executing a search warrant for documents about his $130,000 payment to former adult-film actress Stephanie Clifford, stage name Stormy Daniels, for signing a non-disclosure agreement regarding her alleged 2006 extramarital affair with Trump. Trump has denied the affair. \nThe search warrant also requested documents relating to Cohens ownership of New York City taxi medallions. Cohen has not been charged with a crime in the case. \nCohen has retained lawyer Lanny Davis, who represented the Clintons in the 1990s. When contacted by CNN, Davis declined to comment on the reports that Cohen has alleged Trump knew of the June 2016 meeting. \nSources: CNN, Fox News, Los Angeles Times",

      "Content": "Ireland official repealed its constitutional ban on abortion on Tuesday, following a national referendum on the issue last May. President Michael Higgins signed the bill repealing the Constitutions Eighth Amendment, which had acknowledged the right to life of the unborn as equal to a mothers life. The Irish parliament has not yet passed new laws regulating abortion, so current laws prohibiting abortion remain in effect. \nIrelands prime minister Leo Varadkar said legislation that would permit abortion during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy would be introduced to the parliament in the first week of October. He and health minister Simon Harris said abortion services would be available in the new year. Harris also said doctors could refer patients for abortion services out of the country in the interim. \nThe proposed legislation would include a three-day waiting period for abortions, Harris said. A health committee that spoke to the parliament had advised against imposing a waiting period, which had been proposed for cases where an abortion is medically necessary. \nHarris also said that abortion services would be free under proposed legislation, noting that he did not want cost to be a barrier and did not want private clinics to develop. \nThe referendum\nOn May 29, Ireland voted to overturn its constitutional prohibition on abortion in a national referendum, with 64.1 percent of voters supporting the repeal. Approximately 2.15 million people voted in the referendum. The result was upheld by the Supreme Court earlier this month. \nThe previous referendum on the issue was 35 years ago. Prime Minister Leo Varadkar, who publicly supported the repeal, called the referendum a once-in-a-generation decision.\nAbortion law background\nAfter a referendum in 1983, Ireland changed its constitution to grant an unborn the same right to life as a mother. Article 40.3.3 of the Constitution says, The State acknowledges the right to life of the unborn and, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother, guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate that right.\n\nA high court ruled in 1986 that providing women with information about getting abortions outside of Ireland was unconstitutional, breaching the fetus equal right to life. The Supreme Court reaffirmed this decision in 1988.\n\nIn 1992, Irelands Supreme Court ruled that a person should be permitted to travel outside the country to receive an abortion in cases where the pregnancy presents a real and substantial risk to a mothers life, though this doesnt apply with non-fatal health issues. The ruling overturned a High Court decision that restricted the freedom of movement of a 14-year-old girl who had been raped by a neighbor and attempted to travel to Britain to have an abortion. She was deemed a suicide risk. The attorney general at the time sought the injunction against the girls travel.\n\nIn 1995, Ireland passed the Regulation of Information (Services Outside the State For Termination of Pregnancies) Act, which outlined conditions under which information could be distributed to individuals or groups about abortion services that are available outside of Ireland. The Act did not require medical professionals to distribute information on foreign abortion services.\n\nIn 2013, the country passed the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act (PLDPA), which allowed abortion in cases in which at least two doctors consider there to be a real and substantial risk of loss of the womans life from a physical illness or suicide and in which that risk can only be averted by terminating the pregnancy.\n\nThe act was passed after the 2012 death of a 31-year-old woman, Savita Halappanavar, whose doctors declined to give her an abortion. Halappanavar, an Indian woman in Ireland, went to the hospital 17-weeks pregnant. Her doctors determined a miscarriage was inevitable, yet did not terminate the pregnancy. She died a few days later due to sepsis, a blood infection, and her husband claimed she may have lived if an abortion had been performed.\n\nCatholic population\nAbout 78.3 percent of the approximately 4.75 million Irish citizens self-identified as Roman Catholic, according to a 2016 Census. That represents a decline of 5.9 percent since 2011, and a total decline of 13.3 percent in the past 25 years, according to census results.\nPope Francis visited Ireland in August, the first time a pope visited there since 1979. In 2015, Pope Francis announced that all Catholic priests would be able to forgive the sin of abortion during the jubilee year, also known as the Holy Year or the Year of Mercy, from December 2015 to November 2016.\nIn the Catholic Church, the sin of abortion is punishable by excommunication and in most countries the punishment can only be overturned by a bishop. In some countries, including Britain, Canada, Scotland and the U.S., bishops have delegated authority to priests to absolve the sin.\nThe Catholic Catechism states that human life is sacred and must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception.\nIrish referendums on other social issues\n\nIreland has previously decided the legality of other social issues by referendum. In 1995, Ireland voted 50.3 to 49.8 percent in favor of legalizing divorce. At the time it was the only European nation where divorce was illegal.\n\nIn 2015, Ireland became the first country to legalize same-sex marriage, after a 62 to 38 percent vote in a referendum.\n\nSources: BBC, Catholic News, Citizens Information, CNN, Constitution, Faith Survey, Irish Central, Reuters, National Catholic Reporter, NPR, PLDPA, Regulation of Information Act, The Irish Times, The Irish Times, The Irish Times, The Irish Times, The Guardian, The Guardian, The Guardian, The Washington Post, The Washington Post, Vatican, World Bank",

Mueller has referred Pattens case to prosecutors in Washington, D.C.\nPatten admitted to working with a Russian national to lobby for a pro-Russian political party, the Opposition Bloc, between 2014 and 2018 without registering as a foreign agent, which is required by law under the U.S. Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA). The charge carries a maximum penalty of five years imprisonment and a fine of not more than $250,000. \nThe indictment did not name the Russian national with whom Patten worked. Reuters reported that the Russian may be Kilimnik, with whom Patten created a political advisory firm called Begemot Ventures Ltd LLC in Feb. 2015. Pattens company reportedly received over $1,000,000 for its work for the Opposition Bloc and other Ukraine-related consulting work, according to the indictment.\nMueller indicted both Kilimnik and Manafort on June 8, 2018, on obstruction of justice charges for alleged witness tampering. Manaforts trial for those charges, among others, is scheduled for Sept. 17 in a Washington D.C. court.\nAs part of his plea deal, Patten also admitted to arranging a payment to President Donald Trump's Presidential Inauguration Committee from a Ukrainian client in exchange for tickets to the event. Patten reportedly solicited a U.S. citizen to act as a straw purchaser to buy four tickets totaling $50,000 to Trumps inauguration in Jan. 2017 for a Ukrainian businessman who wanted to attend the event. U.S. law prohibits foreigners from contributing to a presidents inauguration committee. \nIn an archived web page detailing his lobbying work, Patten said he counseled elected officials, opposition leaders, and human rights activists in Albania, Georgia, Iran, Iraq, Kazakhstan, Kyrgystan [sic], Nigeria, Romania, Russia, Thailand, Ukraine, and the United Kingdom, and elsewhere.\nThe case was filed by U.S. Attorney Jessie Liu in Washington, D.C. Patten pleaded guilty before U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson, who will oversee Manaforts upcoming trial, according to Reuters. Patten was released after surrendering his passport; he cannot travel outside the Washington area without first notifying the court. \nA sentencing date has not yet been set.\n\nSources: Archived Patten page, BBC, Indictment, FARA, Patten plea agreement, Reuters",

      "Content": "What is 3D printing?\nThree-dimensional (3D) printing, also known as additive manufacturing, involves making a solid object from a computer file. The technology layers material, usually plastic or metal, on top of itself in a three-dimensional space to create the desired object. The technology can allow users to design and make almost any solid object they can imagine within size restrictions. The raw material must also be supplied to the machines, which are controlled from a computer. \nDevelopment of the technology began in the 1980s, and by the end of the decade some industries were using it. 3D printing technology can now be used for a variety of purposes and uses different materials. For example, researchers have successfully 3D printed functioning organs out of human cells. Companies can also 3D print edible chocolates and other items.\n3D printing became more widely available over the past decade, with small home-use printers becoming available to the public for a couple hundred dollars, and larger, more elaborate ones for tens of thousands. (Printers capable of printing workable firearms likely cost thousands.)\nIn addition to 3D printers, there are also CNC milling machines, which can use a variety of materials and metals. In contrast to a 3D printer that adds material to make a part, a milling machine removes material from a starting piece to make a part, using a rotating tool. In other words, it carves out the desired object. \nWhen did development of 3D-printed guns begin?\nThe first known 3D-printed gun that successfully fired was made by Cody Wilson in 2013. Wilson, now a 30-year-old Texas man, founded Defense Distributed (DD), a non-profit, open source company that has published 3D-printed gun designs online. According to its website, DD is a private defense firm principally engaged in the research, design, development, and manufacture of products and services for the benefit of the American rifleman.\nDD shared the designs for the first entirely 3D-printable handgun, The Liberator, in 2013, which was downloaded about 100,000 times in only two days. DD has also shared computer-aided design (CAD) files for handguns and rifles, such as AR-15s. To comply with the U.S. Undetectable Firearms Act, which makes all plastic guns illegal, DDs 3D-printed designs include a metal part. \nManufacturing the 3D guns is not as simple as pressing a button and you have a gun, Wilson has said interviews. Rather, it requires a person to make individual parts and then assemble them together. DD also sells milling machines for $2000, which come with preloaded gun designs and can manufacture each in about two days. \nWhats happened since?\nIn May 2013, the State Department under the Obama administration sent a letter to DD that instructed the company to stop sharing the file for 3D-printed guns, arguing that the U.S. Arms Export Control Act (AECA) prohibited the distribution of the CAD files from being exported abroad via online downloads, without explicit government permission. DD removed the files from its site, although they remained elsewhere online. \nDD, along with non-profit guns rights group the Second Amendment Foundation, filed a suit against the State Department, alleging that its interpretation of AECA was unconstitutional and prior restraint on freedom of speech. Prior restraint, in First Amendment law, is government action that prohibits speech or other expression before the speech happens, including through the use of injunctions and other means, according to Cornell Laws Legal Information Institute. Courts typically rule such restraint to be unconstitutional, Cornell explained. \nA judge ruled against DDs request for a preliminary injunction to allow it to post CAD files, saying that while restricting First Amendment freedoms unquestionably constitute irreparable injury to the plaintiff, the governments interest in national security and public interest essentially collapse the free speech argument. In an appeal, the decision was upheld, with a judge dissenting. \nA multi-year lawsuit followed, and in June of this year, DD and the State Department reached a settlement agreement, under which DD would be permitted to distribute CAD files for any non-automatic firearms up to .50-caliber, including AR-15 semi-automatic sporting rifles. \nThen at the end of July, eight state attorneys general sued to stop the company from being able to post the designs online, and filed a complaint with the court requesting a temporary injunction against DD distributing the designs. On July 31, a federal judge in Seattle temporarily blocked the plans from being posted. Prior to the judges decision, more than 1,000 people had downloaded the designs. Then on Aug. 27, the judge extended the temporary ban.\nOn Aug. 28, Wilson announced that DD would begin selling the plans for 3D-printed guns, arguing that the judges order blocks the company from giving the plans away for free, but not from selling them.\nWhat do advocates say?\nSupporters of 3D-printed guns generally argue that both the First and Second Amendments give them the right to distribute and use the gun plans. Wilson said in an interview with PragerU that the intersection of these two amendments should grant his cause greater protections. \nThe First Amendment guarantees free speech, which Wilson and his supporters have said grants the right to share CAD files as a part of protected speech. \nI don't believe that access to information is ever tremendously negative or a bad thing. I know that people can use information for bad things. But this isn't a justification to  stop a publisher from speaking, Wilson told CNN in an interview.\n(Note: The case between the State Department and DD did not specifically answer whether CAD files were protected under the First Amendment. In an unrelated case, one judge concluded only that code can merit First Amendment protection, although the scope of such protection remains to be determined. In yet another case, a court ruled that CAD files were purely functional, not language, and thus not protected under the First Amendment. The legal precedent is still unclear, according to Harvard Law Review.)\nThe Second Amendment reads, A well-regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed. Courts have debated interpretations of what this means and whether it applies to individuals (militia or not). In 2008, the U.S. Supreme Court explicitly interpreted the amendment as applying to an individuals right to bear arms for traditionally lawful purposes.\nAdditionally, some of the arguments in support of 3D-printed guns mirror those of other gun-rights advocatesfor instance, the argument that guns are necessary for protection. \nWilson also describes himself as a radical individualist and anarchist, and supports open-source information. He does not describe himself as a gun manufacturer, drawing a distinction between producing the plans and the physical weapons. \nThe guns are downloadable, Wilson said in an interview with CBS News. The files are in the public domain. You cannot take them back. You can adjust your politics to this reality. You will not ask me to adjust mine.\n\nWhat do opponents argue?\nOpponents of 3D-printed guns, in addition to those who oppose private gun ownership in general, have three main criticisms of the guns: they do not require background checks to make, theyre untraceable (they do not have serial numbers and are not registered), and they can be undetectable. Since 3D-printed guns do not require background checks, people who are prohibited from purchasing guns legally could still manufacture 3D-printed guns. \nUndetectable guns, sometimes called ghost guns, will not be caught by metal detectors if they are made from all plastic. Current U.S. law already prohibits all plastic guns under the Undetectable Firearms Act of 1988. That law bans guns that will not be seen by walk-through metal detectors standardly calibrated, and would not generate an image that accurately depicts the shape of the component. (DD has incorporated a small metal part into designs to be in an attempt to comply with this law.) \nThe president is committed to the safety and security of all Americans and considers this his highest responsibility, the White House said at the end of July. In the United States, it is currently illegal to own or make a wholly, plastic gun of any kind  including those made on a 3D printer. The administration supports this nearly two-decade old law. We will continue to look at all options available to us to do what is necessary to protect Americans while also supporting the First and Second amendments.\nWhat has the NRA said on the issue?\nThe National Rifle Association (NRA), which advocates for gun ownership rights, officially commented on the issue on July 31. \nMany anti-gun politicians and members of the media have wrongly claimed that 3-D printing technology will allow for the production and widespread proliferation of undetectable plastic firearms, the NRAs legislative director Chris Cox said. Regardless of what a person may be able to publish on the Internet, undetectable plastic guns have been illegal for 30 years. Federal law passed in 1988, crafted with the NRAs support, makes it unlawful to manufacture, import, sell, ship, deliver, possess, transfer, or receive an undetectable firearm.\nSome critics have pointed out that the widespread production and use of 3D-printed guns could be financially detrimental to gun manufacturers. Some accuse the NRA of lobbying on behalf of manufacturers. The NRA denies this, saying it represents the rights of law-abiding citizens. \nHow many guns are there in the US?\nThe U.S. has approximately 393 million guns, according to a Small Arms Survey, which may not account for all illegally owned guns. The country has a population of 326 million people, according to the U.S. census. \nThese guns are owned by approximately 42 percent of the American population, according to a Gallup poll. That equates to roughly 50 million homes having guns. Gun-owning homes have an average of eight firearms each. \nAccording to the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), U.S. gun manufacturers made more than 11 million guns in 2016 alone. \nIn 2015, there were 36,252 firearm-related deaths in the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control, 12,979 of which were homicides.\n\nSources: ATF, 3DPrinting, ABC News, ACIC, ALL3DP, Arms Export Control Act, CBS News Interview, CDC, CDC, Complaint for Injunction, Cornell LII, CNN, CNN, CNN, DC v Heller, Defense Distributed, Defense Distributed v.

      "Content": "The U.S. ambassador to Mexico, Roberta Jacobson, announced on Thursday that she would resign in May. Jacobson made the announcement in a letter sent to embassy staff. She did not give a reason for the resignation. Jacobson said she had come to the difficult decision that it is the right time to move on to new challenges and adventures. A replacement has not been publicly announced. \nLater on Twitter, Jacobson, 57, said in Spanish that after 31 years working for the U.S. government, it has been an honor and a pleasure to serve as ambassador. She tweeted that she was leaving to pursue other opportunities, and has no information about who would succeed her in the position. Jacobson wrote that she believed relations between the U.S. and Mexico are strong and crucial, ending her tweet saying, We are stronger together!\nJacobson had informed Secretary of State Rex Tillerson of her decision to resign while he was visiting Mexico in January, according to U.S. Undersecretary of State Steve Goldstein. He said Jacobson agreed to stay on until May 5, two years after being sworn into the role. She had been appointed ambassador during the Obama administration, and had previously served as assistant secretary of state for Western Hemisphere affairs.\nMexicos Foreign Relations Department said it had been informed of the decision on February 17. The department said that three days later it had received a request to approve the appointment of a replacement, and did so on Monday, according to AP. The Washington Post reported that, according to anonymous U.S. and Mexican officials, the White House planned to appoint Edward Whitacre, the former CEO of General Motors and ATT, as ambassador. \nUS-Mexican relations\nBilateral trade between the U.S. and Mexico totaled $579.7 billion in 2016. The two countries, along with Canada, are currently in the seventh round of talks in Mexico City to renegotiate the terms of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). \nU.S. President Donald Trump has called for a wall to be built along parts of the U.S.-Mexican border, and previously requested that Mexico provide funding for it. Mexican President Enrique Pea Nieto has said his country would not pay for a border wall. Last week, the countries canceled a plan for Pea Nieto to visit the White House after a disagreement on the issue during a 50-minute phone call. \nSources: AP, CBS News, The New York Times, The Washington Post",

That is enough for a two-thirds supermajority.\nVoter turnout was 69 percent, BBC reported. The Jobbik party, described as nationalist by AP and Reuters, won the second most seats at 25, according to preliminary results.

He campaigned at rallies with supporters. \nOrbns party is described as right-wing and nationalist by media outlets. The prime minister ran on a platform to stop immigration, which he said would slowly overtake the country. In 2015, his government constructed a fence along the borders with Serbia and Croatia to deter illegal immigration. He also said he would reduce income taxes. \nBefore the election, the government submitted a so-called Stop Soros group of bills to parliament, named after Hungarian-born U.S. investor George Soros, who donates to non-government organizations (NGOs) that support open immigration policies. The legislation would impose a 25 percent tax on foreign donations to selected Hungarian NGOs, and would require NGO work to be approved by the interior minister, who could deny permission on the basis of national security. A government spokesperson said the bills were designed to close legal loopholes used by NGOs that advocate for people seeking asylum. \nOrbn said last month that Soros was attempting to turn Hungary into an immigrant country. Soros has called Orbns comments distortions and lies. \nOrbns party won 85 of the 88 districts outside the capital city of Budapest, while left-wing parties won 12 of the 18 districts in the capital area, said Tams Boros, co-director of the Belgian and Hungarian-based Policy Solutions think tank.\nOrbn first served as prime minister from 1998 to 2002, followed by two terms of Socialist party rule. Orban was re-elected as Prime Minister in 2010. His Fidesz party won supermajorities in 2010 and 2014, then lost the two-thirds majority during by-elections in 2015.\nSources: AP, BBC, Reuters",

      "Content": "One Baton Rouge police officer who was involved in the shooting death of Alton Sterling in 2016 will be fired, Police Chief Murphy Paul announced on Friday. Louisianas Attorney General had said Tuesday that no charges would be filed against two officers. The shooting, which occurred during an altercation with police outside a convenience store, was captured on video and shared via social media.\nThe officer who will be fired is Blane Salamoni. The other officer involved in the incident, Howie Lake II, will be suspended without pay for three days, Paul said.\nSterlings death\nIn July 2016, Salamoni and Lake responded to a report of a man with a gun outside a Triple S Food Mart, after a homeless man had called the police about Sterling, according to AP. The homeless man said he had asked Sterling for money and Sterling showed him a gun. Sterling was selling homemade CDs outside near the store.\nThe officers told Sterling, a 37-year-old African American, to put his hands on the hood of a car. According to Landry, Sterling did not comply. Lake used a taser on Sterling before forcing him to the ground. Federal and state authorities said Salamoni yelled that Sterling was reaching for a gun before shooting him three times. He then fired three more shots into Sterlings back when he began to sit up and move. The officers allegedly found a loaded gun in Sterlings pocket.\nThe altercation was captured on bystanders cellphones and then shared on social media. Officers body cameras and a store surveillance camera also recorded the encounter; those videos have not been publicly released. \nIn July 2016, following the deaths of Sterling and others, demonstrations protesting police use of violence against African-Americans took place in Washington, New York and elsewhere.\nFederal investigation\nFederal authorities concluded after a 10-month review that there wasnt enough evidence to prove the officers willfully deprived Sterling of his rights, or that their use of force was not reasonable, Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry said on Tuesday.\nL. Chris Stewart, a lawyer representing Sterlings five children said investigators did not follow up with witnesses, and used information from two federal investigators who had already looked into the case.\nLandry said his office reviewed the evidence compiled by the Justice Department and conducted its own interviews of witnesses. He concluded that drugs found in Sterlings system may have contributed to his non-compliance with police officers requests. \nThe two officers have been on paid administrative leave since the shooting. \nSources: AP, CNN, CNN, The Atlantic",

      "Content": "The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OCPW), an international chemical weapons group, reported on Thursday that military-grade novichok nerve agent was used to poison former Russian Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in the U.K. city of Salisbury last month. The OCPWs findings confirm the U.K. governments determination that novichok was used. Novichok (Russian for newcomer) was originally developed and created by the Soviet Union in the 1970s and 80s. Russia has denied involvement in the poisoning incident. \nSergei and Yulia Skripal were found unconscious on a park bench in Salisbury on March 4, and taken to the hospital. Yulia Skripal, 33, was released from the hospital earlier this week, and reportedly taken to a secure location. The Russian embassy in the U.K. released a statement that said, we congratulate Yulia Skripal on her recovery, and asked for urgent proof that she was reportedly moved to a secure location out of her free will. Her father remains in the hospital.\nSergei Skripal is a former Russian spy who, after being arrested, sentenced and then released in Russia, moved to the U.K. as part of an exchange for Russian spies arrested by the FBI.\nThe OCPW, which implements the 1997 Chemical Weapons Convention, sent investigators to the U.K. on March 19 to test samples. After testing environmental and biomedical samples in four laboratories, the organization determined that the nerve agent was high purity, and confirmed the U.K.s finding about which particular strain it was. The OCPW did not draw a conclusion about the origin of the novichok, or who was responsible for the poisoning. \nOPCW Russian representative Alexander Vasilievich Shulgin said earlier this month that his country had nothing to do with the poisoning and that it had the appearance of a terrorist attack. He has said Russia would reject the results of the OPCW investigation if it was not allowed to participate in the testing of Salisbury samples.\nBritish Prime Minister Theresa May said Russia was highly likely to be responsible for the attack and expelled Russian diplomats. More than 20 other countries expelled a total of 150 Russian diplomats, in support of the U.K. determination. Russia responded by saying it would expel a total of 150 diplomats from those countries.\nSources: OCPW Press Release, The Times",

      "Content": "On Thursday, Israels parliament passed a law that defines the country as a nation-state of the Jewish people. The law, passed by a vote of 62 to 55 with two abstentions, declares that the development of Jewish (sic) settlement was a national value, and that the state will act to encourage and promote its establishment and consolidation. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said, With this law we determined the founding principle of our existence. \nThe law, titled Basic Law: Israel as the Nation State of the Jewish People, says that Israel is the national home of the Jewish people, and the right to exercise national self-determination in the State of Israel is unique to the Jewish people.\nThe law also declared that Jerusalem is the complete and united capital of Israel. Palestinians have called for East Jerusalem to be the capital of a future Palestinian state. Israel annexed East Jerusalem after capturing it in a 1967 war with its Arab neighbors; the annexation is not recognized internationally. In May, the U.S. opened an embassy in Jerusalem, after announcing in December it would move its embassy there from Tel Aviv. Palestinians protested the opening.\nComposed of 11 provisions, the law makes Hebrew the national language and changes the designation of Arabic from being an official language to having special status, whereby it can continue to be used in Israeli institutions. The legislation says it does not harm the status given to the Arabic language before this law came into effect.\nA version of the bill was first introduced in 2011. Israel does not have a constitution; with the passage of the legislation, the country has 14 Basic Laws which have constitutional status, according to BBC. \nResponse to the law\nNetanyahu said, This is a defining moment in the annals of Zionism and the history of the state of Israel. He added, Israel is the nation-state of the Jewish people, and respects the rights of all of its citizens.\nSome Arab members of parliament tore up copies of the bill and one waved a black flag in protest of the legislation.\nAyman Odeh, leader of the Arab Joint List, an alliance of four majority Arab parties, said, \"[Israel] has passed a law of Jewish supremacy and told us that we will always be second-class citizens.\nBenny Begin, son of former Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin who founded Netanyahus Likud party, abstained from voting and said, This is not a decision I expected from the Likud leadership.\nThe American Jewish Committee said it was \"deeply disappointed,\" and that the law \"put at risk the commitment of Israel's founders to build a country that is both Jewish and democratic.\"\nHassan Jabareen, general director of Adalah, the Legal Center for Arab Minority Rights in Israel, said, \"The Jewish nation-state law features key elements of apartheid, which is not only immoral but also absolutely prohibited under international law.\n\"We will keep ensuring civil rights in Israel's democracy but the majority also has rights and the majority decides,\" Netanyahu said last week. He added, An absolute majority wants to ensure our state's Jewish character for generations to come.\nPalestinians have equal rights under the law in Israel. Some Palestinians there have said they are discriminated against and receive lesser services and allocations of education, health and housing compared to some Jews, Al Jazeera reported.\nNetanyahu has said that Palestinians must recognize Israel as a Jewish state in any permanent peace settlement between the two parties. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas has said he will never recognize Israel as a Jewish state. Palestinians have recognized the State of Israel.\nPalestinians account for about 1.8 million, or 20 percent, of the approximately nine million people in Israel, according to Al Jazeera.\nSources: Al Jazeera, BBC, The Times of Israel",

      "Content": "Tesla Inc. withdrew on Wednesday from a party agreement with the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) that was part of the NTSBs investigation into a fatal Model X collision with a concrete barrier on March 23 in California. The agreement with the NTSB had prohibited Tesla from publicly sharing information on the collision while the investigation was ongoing. Tesla said it would continue to provide technical assistance to the NTSB. \nWalter Huang, 38, was killed in the collision while Teslas semi-autonomous Autopilot system was engaged.\nTesla said on Wednesday that it withdrew from the NTSB agreement because it requires that we not release information about Autopilot to the public, a requirement which we believe fundamentally affects public safety negatively. The company said it believe[s] in transparency, so an agreement that prevents public release of information for over a year is unacceptable.\nIn addition to two previous statements on the March 23 collision, Tesla issued a statement on Tuesday saying, according to the family, Mr. Huang was well aware that Autopilot was not perfect and, specifically, he told them it was not reliable in that exact location [of the collision], yet he nonetheless engaged Autopilot there. Tesla added that the collision appeared on a day with several hundred feet of visibility which means that the only way for this accident to have occurred is if Mr. Huang was not paying attention to the road, despite the car providing multiple warnings to do so.\nThe company also said Autopilot requires the driver to be alert and have hands on the wheel, and that the system gave alerts, both visual and auditory, several times to Huang when his hands were not on the wheel during his March 23 drive.\nOn Thursday, NTSB said in a statement that it had removed Tesla from its agreement because Tesla violated the party agreement by releasing investigative information before it was vetted and confirmed by the NTSB. Such releases of incomplete information often lead to speculation and incorrect assumptions about the probable cause of a crash, which does a disservice to the investigative process and the traveling public.\nTesla released a statement on Thursday evening, saying it would make an official complaint to Congress regarding NTSBs release of partial bits of incomplete information to the media, which Tesla said was in violation of NTSBs rules. In its statement earlier on Thursday, NTSB said, Transparency in the investigative process is achieved through the public release of on-scene information, preliminary reports, and the public docket, as well as through board meetings that are open to the public.\nNTSB said its thorough investigations generally take 12 to 24 months and that Tesla was still in party agreements with the agency for investigations into two previous accidents: one involving a Model X in August 2017 in Lake Forest, California, and one with a Model S in January 2018 near Culver City, California.\nIn January 2017, NTSB released a report about 6 1/2 months after a separate fatal Tesla crash involving a Model S while Autopilot was engaged. NTSB said it found no defect in the Autopilot system and that Tesla had updated the system since that crash.\n\nSources: ABC7 News, Bloomberg, Fortune",

      "Content": "On Wednesday, the U.S. State Department announced new sanctions on the Russian Federation for allegedly using a lethal nerve agent against Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia Skripal, in violation of the Chemical and Biological Weapons Control and Warfare Elimination Act. Sergei Skripal was a former Russian spy who worked as a double agent for British Intelligence and became a U.K. citizen. The pair were poisoned in the English city of Salisbury on March 4. Russia has denied involvement. \nThe sanctions are scheduled to take effect on Aug. 22, after a 15-day congressional notification period and upon publication in the U.S. Federal Register. A department spokesperson said the sanctions apply to essentially all Russian state-owned or state-funded enterprises, and estimated that they could affect 70 percent of the countrys economy and about 40 percent of its workforce.\nDuring a press briefing, a U.S. senior state official said that as part of the sanctions, licenses issued by the Department of Commerce for certain national security sensitive goods or technologies would be denied to Russian entities. Such goods may include aero gas turbine engines, integrated circuits, and test and calibration equipment. Russian entities working or contracted with the U.S. government on space flight and commercial passenger aviation may be exempted from the sanctions. Certain unspecified foreign assistance to Russian people would also continue.\nFollowing the use of a Novichok nerve agent in an attempt to assassinate UK citizen Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia Skripal, the United States, on August 6, 2018, determined under the Chemical and Biological Weapons Control and Warfare Elimination Act of 1991 (CBW Act) that the Government of the Russian Federation has used chemical or biological weapons in violation of international law or has used lethal chemical or biological weapons against its own nationals, according to a statement issued by State Department Press Secretary Heather Nauert.\nThe State Department said that if Russia does not meet criteria imposed by the sanctions within 90 days of Wednesdays announcement, additional sanctions may be issued. The criteria include:\n\n\tProviding proof that Russia is no longer using chemical or biological weapons in violation of international law or against its own nationals.\n\tA request that Russia provide reliable assurances that it wont engage in such activities in the future.\n\tAllowing on-site inspections by United Nations observers or other internationally recognized impartial observers, or other reliable means to ensure that Russia is not violating international law with the use of chemical or biological weapons.\n\nRussian spokesman Dmitry Peskov denied Russian involvement during a press conference Thursday. We believe linking new [U.S.] restrictive measures, which we continue to consider illegitimate, to the Salisbury case is totally unacceptable, Russian state media TASS quoted Peskov as saying. We once again flatly reject any accusations regarding the possible involvement of the Russian state in what happened in Salisbury. Thats out of the question. Moreover, we cannot even say unequivocally what and how was used in Britain, because we have no information and have no response to our proposal to the UK on a joint probe into that incident we are profoundly concerned about.\n\nThe Skripal case\nSergei, 66, and Yulia Skripal, 33, were found unconscious on a park bench in Salisbury, England, on March 4, 2018. Police on the scene described the Skripals as being in extremely serious condition, BBC reported. \nInvestigators said it appeared the Skripals first came into contact with the nerve agent at the front door of Sergei Skripals home. Det. Sgt. Nick Bailey became ill after working at the scene, was treated and then discharged on March 22. U.K. police suspected Skripal was targeted due to his Russian intelligence connections.\nThe Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), an independent international body that monitors chemical weapons, and the Defense Science and Technology Laboratory helped identify the nerve agent as Novichok by analyzing samples taken from the victims, areas around Sergei Skripals home and places he and his daughter had visited the day of the poisoning. According to a letter sent from the U.K. national security advisor to the NATO Secretary General, Russia stockpiled and produced small quantities of Novichok within the last decade.\nLeaders of France, Germany, the U.S. and the U.K. issued a joint statement on March 15 condemning the attack and attributing it to Russia.\nIn May, both Skripals recovered from the poisoning and were discharged from the hospital. They are currently in an undisclosed location in England under police protection, The Guardian reported.\nAfter Prime Minister Theresa May declared that Russia was culpable for the alleged attack, the U.K. expelled 23 Russian diplomats from its consulate. President Donald Trump also responded by expelling 60 Russian diplomats from the U.S. In return, Russia expelled 23 British diplomats and 60 U.S. diplomats, and closed the St. Petersburg consulates for both countries.\nRussia denied involvement in the case and has requested to review the evidence.",

The commissions head Ella Pamfilova said he would not be allowed to participate in the electoral race given a prior conviction, which Navalny has said is without merit.\nNavalnys supporters gathered on Sunday alongside a river in Moscow. His team said two election commission members were present to observe the endorsement event, in which Navalny spoke and referred to Putin as a bad president. \nPeople rallied in support of the opposition leader in at least 20 cities on Sunday. According to The Associated Press, Navalny required a minimum of 500 signature endorsements to be eligible to get on the presidential ballot, which requires gathering an additional 1 million signatures. Navalny said he would ask his supporters to boycott the election if his registration in the race were rejected.\nIn February, a Russian court gave Navalny a suspended sentenced for embezzlement. He has denied the charges. Under Russian electoral law, people with a criminal record cannot run for president within 10 years of serving or officially being recognized as having served a sentence. Navalny has been arrested three times this year for organizing unauthorized demonstrations against Putin.\nOn Dec. 6, Putin announced he would run for a fourth presidential term.

      "Content": "On Thursday, European Commission President Jean Claude Juncker said the commission would begin the process of activating a 1996 blocking statute to prohibit European companies from complying with U.S. sanctions on Iran. The statute would also prohibit courts from enforcing U.S. sanctions on European companies. On May 8, President Donald Trump announced the U.S. was withdrawing from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, and would re-implement sanctions against Iran.\nTrump said in his announcement that the U.S. would implement 90- to 180-day wind-down periods for companies to stop doing business with Iran. Trump said after the wind-down period there could be severe consequence for companies that continue doing business with Iran.\nUnder the so-called Iran nuclear deal, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), Iran agreed to give up or limit nuclear activities in exchange for the lifting of sanctions. The U.S., Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and Iran signed the agreement. The EU, Russia and China have said they would honor their parts of the agreement with Iran after the U.S. announced its withdrawal. Iran has not announced whether it would stay in the agreement with the remaining parties.\nJuncker said the commission has a duty to protect European companies. He said the process of activating the blocking statute would begin Friday morning. Activating the statute requires amending it with the approval of the EUs 28 member states. Mina Andreeva, spokesperson for European Commission, said the commissions goal was to have the statute in place by Aug. 6, the end of the 90-day wind-down period.\nThe EU passed the 1996 statute to cover the U.S. trade embargo on Cuba, and sanctions on Iran and Libya. It has not been activated since the EU and the U.S. made political agreements on the sanctions and embargo. The statute specifies that each EU member state shall determine the sanctions to be imposed in the event of breach of the statute. Such sanctions must be effective, proportional and dissuasive, it adds. Some European companies with operations in the U.S. are lobbying their countries to grant them waivers from the blocking statute.\nGerman insurance company Allianz and Danish shipping company Maersk have said they plan to stop doing business in Iran due to the U.S. sanctions.\nJuncker also said the European Commission, the executive arm of the EU, would allow the European Investment Bank to begin facilitating investments of EU companies in Iran. This could allow loans to Iran in euros.\nSources: Al Jazeera, Deutsche Welle",

      "Content": "U.S. House Republicans released a declassified memorandum on Friday that says there were concerns with legitimacy and legality in FBI and Department of Justice efforts to obtain a 2016 surveillance warrant for a member of Trumps presidential campaign. President Donald Trump approved the release of the memo and did not request any redactions, according to White House spokesman Raj Shah.\nThe memo relates to the process used to obtain a warrant through the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) court to surveil Carter Page, a U.S. citizen and volunteer adviser on the Trump campaign. The document, written by House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) and his staff to the Republican majority on the committee, is based on testimony from then-Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe, who resigned last week.\nThe House committee voted along party lines on Jan. 29 to publicly release the previously classified memo, and then sent it to Trump for approval, in accordance with House Rule X, clause 11(g). (The committee could then release the memo unless the president sent a written notification within five days that release would be a threat to the national interest.) \nIn a letter to the committee chair, Trumps attorney Donald McGahn II wrote that, after review with a legal team, Trump determined it was appropriate to release the memo in accordance with standards that permit declassification when the public interest in disclosure outweighs any need to protect the information.\nPrior to release, the FBI had advised against releasing the memo publicly, citing concerns over material omissions that impact the memos accuracy. The FBI statement did not specify what was omitted. \nDemocrats on the intelligence committee wrote a memo in response that claims the Republican memo mischaracterizes McCabes testimony. The committee voted in favor of releasing the minoritys memo to the full House, but against releasing it to the public. \nThe Nunes memo\nThe memo concludes that the FBIs use of FISA raises concerns about the legitimacy and legality of certain DOJ and FBI interactions with the court that grants FISA requests, and a troubling breakdown of the FISA process. According to the memo, the application for a probable cause FISA warrant on Page, which was granted on Oct. 21, 2016, cited a dossier on Trump that was compiled by Christopher Steele. McCabe testified that the FBI would not have sought the warrant without the dossier, according to the memo.\nSteele, a former British intelligence agent, had worked as an FBI source, but compiled the dossier as opposition research for the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign. In the dossier, Steele alleged that Page met with Russian officials while on the Trump campaign and discussed the possibility of deals about sanctions, business opportunities and alleged Russian interference in the election. Page denies he engaged in any illegal acts or political deals with Russian officials.\nThe Nunes memo reports that the FISA warrant application, and three subsequent renewal applications, did not disclose that the DNC funded the dossier. It alleged the FBI and Department of Justice knew how the dossier was funded at the time. The FISA warrant also cited a September 2016 Yahoo News article, as supporting evidence for the application. The memo concludes that the news article does not corroborate the Steele dossier because it is derived from information that Steele himself leaked to the outlet. Steele was later terminated as an FBI source for unauthorized disclosures to a separate media source, the memo reported.\nSteele is quoted as allegedly saying he was desperate for Trump to not be elected, according to the memo. It says the FISA application relied on Steeles past record of credible reporting, but ignored or concealed his anti-Trump financial and ideological motivations.\nRead the full memo, as well as the letter from Trumps lawyer, here.\nIn addition to the initial October 2016 FISA application, the warrant on Page was renewed three times. In order to grant renewals of the FISA warrant, which are needed every 90 days to stay in effect, the court would have determined that the investigation was resulting in enough information to merit renewal, CNN reported.\nComments on the release\nOn Wednesday, prior to the release of the memo, the FBI released a public statement that said the bureau had received limited time to review it, but that it had grave concerns about material omissions of fact that fundamentally impact the memos accuracy.\nCalifornia Rep. Adam Schiff, the highest-ranking Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, said on Friday that the memo cherry picks information from the McCabe testimony and misrepresents it.\nIn a statement released on Friday, the minority members of the committee said the Republican memo was a shameful effort to discredit these institutions, undermine the Special Counsels ongoing investigation, and undercut congressional probes.\nThe Majority suggests that the FBI failed to alert the court as to Mr. Steeles potential political motivations or the political motivations of those who hired him, but this is not accurate, the statement said. The GOP memo also claims that a Yahoo News article was used to corroborate Steele, but this is not at all why the article was referenced. These are but a few of the serious mischaracterizations of the FISA application, the statement said.\nNunes told Fox News that he supported the release because he has an obligation to the American people when we see FISA abuse.\nPage, who had been surveilled, said in a statement on Friday that the Congressional leaders discovered an unprecedented abuse of process, calling it a historic leap in the repair of America's democracy.\nSources: House Intelligence Memo, CNN, Fox News",

      "Content": "Venezuelan incumbent President Nicols Maduro won a second six-year term in the countrys election on Sunday. He received 5.8 million votes, approximately 68 percent of the popular vote, with 92 percent of voting centers reporting their results, according to Venezuelas electoral commission. Voter turnout was 46 percent, lower than the approximately 80 percent turnout during the last two presidential elections, according to The New York Times.\nOf the other candidates, Henri Falcn, a former state governor, received 1.8 million votes and Javier Bertucci, an evangelical minister, received 925,000 votes. \nMaduro gave a speech Sunday night in Caracas, calling the vote an impeccable electoral process, and saying, the whole of Venezuela has triumphed. Maduro, 55, served as Venezuelas vice president from October 2012 to March 2013, and was then elected president in 2013 after the death of President Hugo Chvez. \nMaduros current term is scheduled to run through the end of this year, and his second term until the end of 2024.\nPrior to the election results being published, Falcn said, We dont recognize this electoral process as valid, adding that for us, there was no election. There must be a new election in Venezuela. Electoral authorities had banned some opposition political parties and prevented some politicians from running prior to the vote,The New York Times reported. Some opposition politicians called for an election boycott.\nInternational response to the election\nThe United States and the 14-nation Lima group, a regional bloc that seeks to resolve the breakdown of democratic order in Venezuela, said they did not recognize Venezuelas election results. \nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the U.S. would take swift economic and diplomatic actions to support the restoration of Venezuelas democracy. The U.S. sanctioned Venezuelan officials last year and prohibited transactions with Venezuelas new petro digital currency earlier this year, both in response to allegations by the U.S. Treasury Departments Office of Foreign Assets Control that Venezuelan officials tampered with the countrys Oct. 15 state elections.\nBritish Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, currently in Buenos Aires at a meeting of G20 foreign ministers, said the group would be talking about what we can do, and saying they see no alternative to [adding] economic pressure on the country through sanctions.\nCuban President Miguel Daz-Canel congratulated Maduro on his election victory, and Russian President Vladimir Putin wished Maduro good health and success in resolving the social and economic problems in Venezuela.\nVenezuelan economy\nVenezuelas inflation was more than 4,000 percent last year, and its currency, the bolivar, lost 98 percent of its value, according to CNN.

      "Content": "On Friday, U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions fired former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, less than two days before he was planning to retire. Sessions said he fired McCabe based on a Justice Department (DOJ) report alleging he made an unauthorized disclosure to the media and lacked candor with investigators about an FBI case involving Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation. McCabe denied the allegations. \nThe Associated Press said McCabe wrote memos on meetings he had with President Donald Trump and former FBI Director James Comey, which Special Counsel Robert Mueller reportedly has. Last May, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed Mueller as Special Counsel to investigate an alleged Russian influence campaign in the 2016 presidential election and related matters. Muellers team is also investigating whether there was coordination between Trumps campaign and Russia to influence the election. Muellers team has interviewed McCabe, inquiring about Trumps firing of Comey in May, according to CNN.\nIn January, McCabe said he would retire as FBI Deputy Director after 21 years with the bureau, and would take earned leave days until his retirement in March. His dismissal before retirement may affect his pension. \nIn a statement Friday, Sessions said an investigation by the DOJs Office of the Inspector General (OIG) found McCabe had made an unauthorized disclosure to the news media regarding an investigation into donations to the Clinton Foundation by people Hillary Clinton interacted with as secretary of state. Sessions also said McCabe lacked candor  including under oath  on multiple occasions. Sessions said the OIG provided its report to the FBIs Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR), which came to the same conclusion and recommended McCabes dismissal.\nMcCabe responded to his dismissal by saying he was being treated this way because of his actions and events he witnessed after Trump fired Comey, and because he said he would corroborate Comeys accounts of his discussions with the President. McCabe added, This attack on my credibility is one part of a larger effort not just to slander me personally, but to taint the FBI, law enforcement, and intelligence professionals more generally. \nMcCabe also said that during inquiries on his behavior, he answered questions truthfully and as accurately as [he] could amidst the chaos that surrounded him. When I thought my answers were misunderstood, I contacted investigators to correct them, he added. \nMcCabe became Deputy Director of the FBI in January 2016. He became acting director after Comeys firing and until Christopher Wray became FBI director last August.\nComey, McCabe memos\nTrump dismissed Comey on the recommendation of Sessions and Rosenstein regarding Comeys handling of the Hillary Clinton email server investigation. In his memos after meetings with Trump, Comey alleged that the president said he hoped Comey could let this go, presumably referring to an investigation into former National Security Adviser Michael Flynns contacts with Russians. Trump denied asking Comey to close his investigation of Flynn.\nMcCabe wrote memos about three in-person and one phone meeting with Trump, according to CNN. McCabe said that on each occasion Trump mentioned McCabes wife, Jill, who was defeated after running as a Democrat for the Virginia state Senate in 2015. Trump has tweeted criticism about contributions to her campaign from former Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe, whom he said was a friend of Clintons. The FBI said McCabe was not overseeing the Clinton investigation when McAuliffe contributed to his wifes campaign, and that he had received ethics approvals for her candidacy.\nAccording to McCabe, Trump asked him who he voted for in the 2016 presidential election. Trump denied asking this. McCabe did not vote in that election, CNN reported.\nTrumps tweets, his lawyers comments\nRegarding McCabes dismissal, Trump tweeted Friday saying it was a great day for the hard working men and women of the FBI - A great day for Democracy. He criticized Comeys and McCabes character, adding that McCabe supposedly knew all about the lies and corruption going on at the highest levels of the FBI! Trump did not provide details to support the allegations.\nOn Sunday, Trump tweeted, Spent very little time with Andrew McCabe, but he never took notes when he was with me. \nTrumps personal lawyer, John Dowd, sent an email to The Daily Beast saying he pray[ed] that Rosenstein would follow Sessions example and bring an end to [the] alleged Russia Collusion investigation manufactured by McCabes boss James Comey based upon a fraudulent and corrupt Dossier. Dowd first said he was speaking as Trumps counsel, and later said he was speaking in a personal capacity, according to The Daily Beast.\nAlso on Sunday, Trump tweeted, Why does the Mueller team have 13 ... Democrats and Zero Republicans? He added that there is NO COLLUSION! \nSources: AP, CNN, The Hill, The New York Times",

He added, If [the meeting] doesnt take place, thats fine, and if it does take place, I think some tremendous things can happen. Trumps comments came after North Korea suspended talks with South Korea on Wednesday.\nWhen North Korea suspended talks with the South on denuclearization and a formal close to the 1950-1953 Korean War, it described joint military exercises the U.S. and South Korea had scheduled for that day as a provocation and a preparation for an invasion of the North. South Korea said the exercises were not an attack drill. The U.S. and South Korea have conducted the drills every year for about the past decade.\nTrump said of the North Korea meeting preparations: North Korea is actually talking to us about times and everything else as though nothing happened. He made his comments during a meeting at the White House with NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg.\nNorth Korea said Wednesday it was not interested in a one-sided meeting with the U.S. that would have the North abandon its nuclear weapons program. North Korean Vice Foreign Minister Kim Gye Gwan said the world knows too well that our country is neither Libya nor Iraq, which have met a miserable fate. \nIn 2003, Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi agreed to denuclearization in exchange for sanctions being lifted. Rebels overthrew and killed Gadhafi in 2011. National Security Adviser John Bolton said in April that the U.S. had in mind the Libya model from 2003, 2004 in regards to North Korean nuclear disarmament. \nTrump said, \"the Libyan model isn't a model that we have at all when we're thinking of North Korea. He said, In Libya we decimated that country, adding, \"There was no deal to keep Qaddafi.\" Trump also said, That model would take place if we don't make a deal [with North Korea], most likely.\nTrump said if North Korea agreed to denuclearize, Kim would get protections that would be very strong.\" He said it would be something where [Kim would] be there, he'd be in his country, he'd be running his country. His country would be very rich.\nTrump added he is \"willing to do a lot\" to provide security assurances to Kim. \"The best thing he could do is make a deal.\"\nSources: BBC, Fox News, The White House",

Senate leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said that a vote was scheduled for noon on Monday on a bill to fund the government for three more weeks, moving it from an originally scheduled vote at 1 a.m. Monday morning.\nAs part of the negotiations on the spending bill, Senate Democrats are seeking to extend the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. They have also asked for increased funding for disaster relief and opioid treatment programs.\nWhat happens in a government shutdown?\nDuring a government shutdown, some nonessential governmental departments are closed and employees are placed on furlough. This means they will not go to work this Monday or receive a paycheck, unless Congress reaches an agreement before then.\nServices deemed essential continue. These include food inspections, air traffic control, national security, disaster assistance, prison operations, taxation, electricity production and Social Security. The U.S. Postal Service still continues to deliver mail, according to CNN.\nMilitary services still operate, The Washington Post reported, though service members are not paid unless Congress passes a special measure for them.\nDuring past shutdowns, national parks and monuments have closed at least partially. On Sunday, sites such as Philadelphias Liberty Bell were closed, while other sites such as Yellowstone National Park were open.\nAbout 800,000 government workers were furloughed during the last shutdown in 2013, which occurred as Republicans unsuccessfully lobbied for changes to the Affordable Care Act.\nSources: AP, BBC, CNN",

The study analyzed earthquakes since 1900 that measured at least 7 on the Richter scale and found that periods of greater seismic activity followed five-year periods when the earths rotation slowed by as little as a millisecond. The last such slowdown, which the studys coauthor said is very accurately measured by atomic clocks, began four years ago.\nRoger Bilham of the University of Colorado and Rebecca Bendick of the University of Montana published their findings earlier this year and presented it at the annual Geological Society of America meeting last month. \nFollowing the periods of slowed rotation of the earth, there were between 25 to 30 intense earthquakes a year, compared to an average of 15 major quakes per year, Bilham told The Guardian. He said, the inference is clear, and that next year we should see a significant increase in numbers of severe earthquakes.\nBilham said that most of the earthquakes during the previous periods of slower rotation occurred in tropical regions near the equator.\nSources: The Guardian, RT",

No deaths were reported in either attack. Israel said most of the mortars from Gaza were intercepted by its Iron Dome aerial defense system, and that three soldiers were wounded. Al-Qassam Brigades and al-Quds Brigades, divisions of the Hamas and Islamic Jihad Palestinian groups, claimed responsibility for the rocket attacks from Gaza.\nAt least 121 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza during protests that started on March 30, according to Al Jazeera. Palestinians have protested for the right to return to Israel for people whose ancestors lived in Israel before the May 1948 war between Israel and neighboring countries. Israel has not granted the right to return. The majority of the Palestinians killed were shot by Israeli snipers after the protesters approached the Gaza border fence. Israel also used tear gas on protesters. Israel has said its forces have operated in accordance with the rules of engagement to protect its border.\nOn Sunday, an Israeli tank fired on a Islamic Jihad observation post and killed three people, according to Al Jazeera. Islamic Jihad said, we know how to respond to this dangerous escalation.\nAl-Qassam and al-Quds said their joint response of rocket attacks from Gaza on the occupations military positions  is a declaration, that these crimes cannot be tolerated in any way. They said Israel's aggression against our people was an attempt to shift attention away from the crimes it carried out against our peaceful civilians.\nIsraeli foreign ministry spokesman Emmanuel Nahshon tweeted: No country in the world would or should accept such threats to its civilian population. Neither do we.\nOn Monday, the Israeli military killed a Palestinian it said approached the Gaza border fence with Israel. Also on Monday, machine-gun fire from Gaza hit buildings in the Israeli city of Sderot. Over the weekend, Palestinians cut through the Gaza fence and set an empty Israeli military post on fire. In response, Israeli airplanes bombed a Hamas military compound.\nHamas is a political organization with an armed division that governs the Gaza territories. The Palestinian Islamic Jihad Movement is a militant organization whose aim is to eliminate Israel from the region, according to the Council on Foreign Relations. Israel and the U.S. have described Hamas and Islamic Jihad as a terrorist organizations.\nSources: Al Jazeera, Council on Foreign Relations, The New York Times, The Times of Israel",

      "Content": "Democratic staff of the Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs released a report on Wednesday alleging misconduct by Rear Adm. Ronny Jackson, President Donald Trumps personal physician and nominee to head the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). The report outlines allegations that colleagues described Jackson as abusive, that he over-prescribed medications, prescribed medication to himself and had been in a car accident while driving under the influence of alcohol. Jackson has not responded to all the allegations, though he denied crashing a car. He said he looked forward to a hearing where he could answer senators questions.\nThe two-page report was prepared with the testimony of 23 unnamed current and former colleagues of Jacksons, according to The New York Times. The allegations are currently unsubstantiated and committee members are investigating further, CNN reported.\nOne nurse said Jackson had written prescriptions to himself, and when this became known by others, asked a physician assistant to prescribe medications for him.\nThe report alleged that testimony indicated the White House Medical Unit (WHMU) where Jackson worked had questionable record keeping for pharmaceuticals and that Jackson would account for some medications after he had distributed them. White House Legislative Affairs Director Marc Short said reviews of the WHMU were conducted yearly, including reviews of prescriptions. Short said, every year, theyve said that hes totally in compliance with what hes been prescribing.\nThe report also alleged that after a party, Jackson wrecked a government vehicle while intoxicated. Jackson said, I have not wrecked a car. I can tell you that. \nWhite House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said on Wednesday that there had been at least four previous background investigations of Jackson while he was associated with the White House, including one by the FBI. She said, None of those things have come up in the four separate background investigations that have taken place. She also said, Dr. Jacksons record as a White House physician has been impeccable.\nOn Tuesday, the Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs indefinitely postponed Jacksons hearing, originally scheduled for Wednesday. \nSources: CNN, The New York Times, The Washington Post",

Get ready Russia because they will be coming, nice and new and smart! On Monday, Trump had said nothings off the table, referring to a potential military response to an alleged chemical attack that killed at least 40 people in Douma on Saturday. The Russian and Syrian governments have denied that a chemical attack occurred.\nOn Thursday, Trump tweeted, Never said when an attack on Syria would take place. Could be very soon or not so soon at all!\nTrumps Wednesday tweet came after Alexander Zasypkin, Russian ambassador to Lebanon, told Hezbollahs al-Manar TV on Tuesday that \"if there is a strike by the Americans, then we refer to the statements of President Putin and the chief of staff that the missiles will be downed and even the sources from which the missiles were fired. Russian chief of staff Gen. Valery Gerasimov said in March that Moscow would shoot down missiles and attack launch sites if Russian armed forces in Syria were threatened, Al Jazeera reported. Gerasimov also said militants in Syria were planning on staging chemical attacks as if the government had ordered them, with civilians sent to play victims in eastern Ghouta.\nRussian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said, smart missiles should be fired at terrorists and not at the legitimate government which has been fighting terrorists.\nOn Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it was deeply alarmed by reports of the alleged chemical attack. It said 43 out of more than 70 people who reportedly died while taking shelter in a basement had deaths related to symptoms consistent with exposure to highly toxic chemicals. It added that about 500 patients seen by local hospitals and clinics showed symptoms consistent with toxic chemical exposure. The Russian Defense Military said WHOs statement was unfounded and that reports of a chemical attack were a fabrication and provocation. \nOn Sunday, Trump tweeted that the area of the alleged chemical attack was in lockdown and encircled by Syrian Army, making it completely inaccessible to outside world. U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said Wednesday that the U.S. and its allies were still assessing the intelligence to determine who was responsible for the alleged chemical attack.\nOn Tuesday, Syria invited international inspectors to visit the site of the alleged attack. The same day, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons said it would deploy a fact-finding mission to Douma. Also on Tuesday, the U.N. Security Council rejected a draft resolution by the U.S. and another by Russia that proposed setting up a group of experts to investigate chemical weapons attacks in Syria, Al Jazeera reported.\nLt. Gen. Viktor Poznikhir, deputy chief of operations of the Russian General Staff, said Russian military police would be in Douma on Friday.\nBritish Prime Minister Theresa May said the use of chemical weapons cannot go unchallenged. She said the U.K. would be working with allies to consider how we can ensure that those responsible are held to account and how we can prevent and deter the humanitarian catastrophe of the use of chemical weapons in the future.\"\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron has said chemical weapons capabilities could be targets of a strong and joint response to Syria. Macron said Thursday that he has proof that Syria used chemical weapons in Saturdays attack in Douma.\nThe White House said Trump canceled a trip to Latin America scheduled to begin Friday due to the situation in Syria. \nIn his next tweet on Wednesday, Trump wrote, Our relationship with Russia is worse now than it has ever been, and that includes the Cold War. There is no reason for this. Russia needs us to help with their economy, something that would be very easy to do, and we need all nations to work together. Stop the arms race?\nSince government bombing of Eastern Ghouta began on February 18, more than 1,600 civilians have been killed there, according to Al Jazeera.\nIn April 2017, the U.S. responded to an alleged nerve-agent attack by the Syrian government by firing more than 50 Tomahawk cruise missiles at a Syrian air base.\nSources: Al Jazeera, AP, NBC News, The Washington Post, RT",

      "Content": "On Monday, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo spoke about the flaws of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, formally called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), and listed 12 U.S. requirements for a potential new agreement with Iran. President Donald Trump announced on May 8 that the U.S. would withdraw from the 2015 deal, saying the decision was to prevent nuclear proliferation in Iran. Britain, France and Germany have said they continue to support the deal.\nPompeo, speaking at the Heritage Foundation in Washington, D.C., said the JCPOAs sunset provisions, or clauses that would expire after a certain number of years, delayed Irans inevitable nuclear weapons capability. The mechanisms for inspecting and verifying Irans compliance with the JCPOA were not sufficient, Pompeo argued, adding that the agreement failed to address Irans development of ballistic and cruise missiles. \nIn his speech, Pompeo said the U.S. would impose further sanctions on Iran, the strongest sanctions in history, if the regime does not change its course. He said the Department of Defense and U.S. allies would deter Iranian aggression in the region. \nPompeo said the U.S. was open to new steps with Iran and gave 12 requirements for a new agreement. He outlined the steps in his speech as the following: \n1. Iran must declare a full account of the prior military dimensions of its nuclear program to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), and permanently and verifiably abandon such work in perpetuity.\n2. Iran must stop enrichment and never pursue plutonium reprocessing. This includes closing its heavy water reactor.\n3. Iran must provide the IAEA with unqualified access to all sites throughout the entire country.\n4. Iran must end its proliferation of ballistic missiles and halt further launching or development of nuclear-capable missile systems.\n5. Iran must release all U.S. citizens, as well as citizens of U.S. partners and allies.\n6. Iran must end support for Middle East terrorist groups, including Lebanese Hezbollah, Hamas, and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad.\n7. Iran must respect the sovereignty of the Iraqi government and permit the disarming, demobilization, and reintegration of Shiite militias.\n8. Iran must end its military support for the Houthi militia and work towards a peaceful political settlement in Yemen.\n9. Iran must withdraw all forces under Iranian command throughout the entirety of Syria.\n10. Iran must end support for the Taliban and other terrorists in Afghanistan and the region, and cease harboring al-Qaida leaders.\n11. Iran must end the support of Irans Quds Force (the special forces of Irans Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corp)  for terrorists and militant partners around the world.\n12. Iran must end its threatening behavior against its neighbors, including its threats to destroy Israel, its firing of missiles into Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, its threats to international shipping, and cyberattacks.\nResponses to Pompeos speech\nThe European Union said in a statement: Secretary Pompeos speech has not demonstrated how walking away from the JCPOA has made or will make the region safer from the threat of nuclear proliferation or how it puts us in a better position to influence Irans conduct in areas outside the scope of JCPOA. There is no alternative to the JCPOA.\nIranian President Hassan Rouhani was quoted on state television, saying, Who are you to decide for Iran and the world? The world today does not accept America to decide for the world ... We will continue our path with the support of our nation.\nSources: Remarks by Secretary of State, Reuters, The New York Times",

As lawmakers consider these bills, it may be helpful to take stock of the various gun control laws that have been passed over the past 30 years, or recently introduced. Heres a brief timeline.\nAs lawmakers consider these bills, it may be helpful to take stock of the various gun control laws that have been passed over the past 30 years, or recently introduced. Heres a brief timeline:\nNov. 10, 1988: Undetectable Firearms Act prohibits the manufacture, import, sale, shipment, delivery, possession or transfer of any firearm that may not be detectable by walk-through metal detectors.\nNov. 29, 1990: The Crime Control Act of 1990 increases penalties for people who commit certain crimes using short-barreled rifles or shotguns or destructive devices. It also prohibits the transfer of guns to residents across state lines, and amends the Federal criminal code to impose criminal penalties against citizens who possess or discharge a gun in a school zone.\nNov. 30, 1993: The Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act establishes rules for buying guns, such as background checks and five-day waiting periods. The waiting periods provision expired five years later.\nSept. 13, 1994: The Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 authorizes the use of the death penalty for certain gun-related crimes. It prohibits the possession of a gun or ammunition by a minor, with some exceptions. It allows for enhanced penalties for crimes involving guns and revises the definition for armor piercing ammunition. It also temporarily prohibits the manufacture and sale of semiautomatic assault weapons; the prohibition ends in 2004. \nNov. 13, 1998: A bill to throttle criminal use of guns, S.191, increases mandatory minimum prison sentences for people who use guns during certain crimes, such as drug offenses.\nNov. 30, 1998: The FBI establishes the NICS database in 1998, as mandated by the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act of 1993. Since then, more than 230 million background checks have been performed resulting in more than 1.3 million denials of firearms purchases, according to the FBI.\nOct. 26, 2005: The Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act prohibits people from filing a civil suit against a manufacturer or seller of a firearm, ammunition, or a component of a firearm, though some exclusions apply. It also prohibits gun sales and gun transfers to people without gun licenses unless the transferee is provided with a secure gun storage or safety devices. Some exceptions apply.\nJan. 8, 2008: The NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007 amends the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act of 1993 to add incentives for states to provide information to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS).\nOct. 19, 2017: Rep. Carlos Curbelo (R-Fla.) introduces a bill that would effectively ban the sale and manufacture of bump stocks and devices that are designed and function to increase the rate of fire of a semiautomatic rifle but  not convert the semiautomatic rifle into a machine gun. The bill currently has 37 cosponsors: 19 Republicans and 18 Democrats. (Bill is currently under consideration.)\nOct. 25, 2017: Sen. Christopher Murphy (D-Conn.) introduces a bill titled Background Check Expansion Act, which would require background checks for all gun purchases, including private gun sales. The bill currently has 35 cosponsors: 1 Independent and 34 Democrats. (Bill is currently under consideration.)\nOct. 31, 2017: Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick (R-Pa.) introduces a bill entitled Closing the Bump-Stock Loophole Act. The bill has five cosponsors: one Republican and four Democrats. According to The Hill, the legislation would require owners and people wanting to purchase bump stocks to register with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, be background checked, fingerprinted and pay a $200 registration fee. The bill currently has 7 cosponsors: 1 Republican and 6 Democrats. (Bill is currently under consideration.)\nMar. 23, 2018: The president signs the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018, which includes the Fix NICS Act that contains incentives such as grants and penalties for government agencies to report records to NICS. (The acronym stands for National Instant Criminal Background Check System.) The Fix NICS Act also creates a Domestic Abuse and Violence Prevention Initiative that emphasizes the need for grantees to identify and upload all felony conviction records and domestic violence records. (In 1995, the National Criminal History Improvement Program came into effect, and in 2007 the NICS Improvement Amendments Act was implemented. Both laws incentivize states to enter records into a firearm background check system. The National Rifle Association says it wont oppose the new bill.)\nMar. 23, 2018: The president signs the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018, which also includes the STOP School Violence Act of 2018. The latter act allocates grant money to states for training and evidence-based strategies and programs to prevent violence, such as using metal detectors and emergency notification and response technologies.

The food and drug authority in the province where the company is located announced that more than 250,000 doses of the companys vaccine for diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis, or whooping cough, (DTP) were substandard. \nThe DTP vaccine is subsidized by the Chinese government and infants across the country are inoculated with it. \nMore than 250,000 DTP vaccine doses from the batch had been sold to disease control and prevention centers in eastern China, according to state media outlet CGTN. It is not known how many children may have been inoculated with the substandard vaccines, BBC reported, and there have been no reports of any children becoming ill after being inoculated.\nSeparately, Chinas Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) announced on Sunday that during a July 15 government inspection, it found that the drug company had falsified data, including production records and product inspection records, while manufacturing its human rabies vaccine. According to Xinhua, 113,000 doses of the rabies vaccine were affected. The CFDA ordered the company to stop producing the vaccine and to comprehensively investigate the risks it posed. \nSince the discovery, the CFDA has revoked Changchun Changshengs license for human rabies vaccine, recalled unused supplies of the vaccine and fined the company 3.4 million yuan ($510,000). There is no evidence anyone was harmed by the use of the defective vaccines, according to the CFDA. \nXi said it was the responsibility of all Communist Party committees and all levels of government to ensure drug safety in the country.\nChinas federal government sent a team to investigate Changchun Changsheng, which is located in the city of Changchun, the capital of Jilin province. Other teams at the provincial and city levels have started investigating Changchun Changsheng and other pharmaceutical companies in the province, according to Xinhua. \nThe chairwoman and four executives of the company were taken into custody for questioning, CNN reported. The Changchun city police have opened a criminal investigation into the company. \nIn a statement, Changchun Changsheng management said the company felt \"very ashamed and guilty\" about the vaccines and would learn a lesson and take practical corrective measures and rectify thoroughly.\" \nSources: BBC, CNN, Xinhua",

      "Content": "The Saudi-led coalition of Arab countries began an attack on the Yemeni port city of Hodeida on Wednesday, as part of the largest battle between the Saudi coalition and the Houthis in Yemens three-year civil war. Houthi rebels, an armed political group of Shiite Muslims, have held the city since 2015, according to The Associated Press. \n\nThe operation, called Golden Victory, included attacks by air and sea vessels, as well as ground troops, Saudi state media reported. \nAbout 70 percent of Yemens food enters via Hodeida, along with humanitarian aid and fuel. During the initial attacks, the port remained open to shipping, AP reported. Four Emirati soldiers were killed during the attacks on Wednesday, according to United Arab Emirates (UAE) state-run media.\nHouthis took control of Sanaa, Yemens capital, in September 2014, and Yemeni President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi went into exile. Saudi Arabia has led a coalition of Arab countries to fight Houthis in Yemen since March 2015. Iran supplies the Houthis with weapons, according to the United Nations, the U.S. and other nations.\nYemens exiled government has exhausted all peaceful and political means to remove the Houthi militia from the port of Hodeida, it said in a statement. Liberation of the port of Hodeida is a milestone in our struggle to regain Yemen from the militias.\nA military official for the Yemeni government said the Saudi-led coalition had 21,000 troops ready for the attack, including Yemeni, Emirati and Sudanese soldiers, Reuters reported.\nCoalition plans\nSaudi-led coalition spokesman Col. Turki al-Maliki said it plans to take control of the airport, seaport and a route leading to Sanaa. We will not fight a street war with the Houthis in Hodeida city, for the safety of civilians, al-Maliki said. \nOn Wednesday, Saudi Arabia and the UAE announced a multi-faceted plan to protect civilians in Hodeida that involved establishing routes for food, medical supplies and oil from the Saudi city of Jizan and from Abu Dhabi, in the UAE. \nYemeni civilians\nAbout 600,000 people live in and around Hodeida, according to Al Jazeera. The U.N. said, as many as 250,000 people may lose everything  even their lives in the attack on Hodeida. \nThe U.N. had been attempting to negotiate a deal to avoid the attack, Al Jazeera reported. Martin Griffiths, U.N. special envoy to Yemen, called on all parties to exercise restraint \nSources: Al Jazeera, AP, CRF, Reuters, World Health Organization",

New York City, San Francisco and Philadelphia filed the lawsuit in the U.S. District Court in Alexandria, Virginia, after a gunman killed 26 and injured 20 at a Texas church in November. The suit alleges the department failed to report criminal convictions to the FBIs National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) and that compliance might have prevented the shooting.\nThe gunman, Devin Kelley, was convicted of domestic violence in a military court in 2014 while serving in the U.S. Air Force. All federal agencies, including the military, are required to submit mandatory compliance reports to the NICS containing information on violent crimes. The lawsuit claims Kelley would have been barred from purchasing a gun if the military had reported his case to the NICS. \nA spokesperson for the Justice Department said Attorney General Jeff Sessions has launched an investigation into the matter and is determining next steps.\nSources: Fox News, The Washington Post",

      "Content": "Twitter users called for a boycott of MGM Resorts International, which owns Las Vegas Mandalay Bay hotel, and associated businesses on Tuesday. Last Friday, MGM filed a lawsuit in Nevada and California against more than 1,000 people whom it said had sued the company or given notice they intended to do so over last Octobers Las Vegas shooting that killed 58 people and wounded more than 500. The suit requested that a federal court rule that MGM cannot be held liable for the shooting.\nOn Oct. 1, 2017, Stephen Paddock shot from the 32nd floor of MGMs Mandalay Bay hotel into a crowd at an outdoor country music festival below.\nCertain victims have brought lawsuits against MGM for what they allege was inadequate security, which allowed Paddock to bring multiple suitcases with rifles and thousands of rounds of ammunition into his hotel room, The New York Times reported.\nA security company that MGM hired for the country music festival, Contemporary Services Corporation (CSC), had certain protection from liability in acts of terrorism, as granted by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) under the federal SAFETY Act. MGM argued in its lawsuit that the shooting qualified as an act of terrorism. \nCongress passed the SAFETY Act, formally called the Support Anti-terrorism by Fostering Effective Technologies Act, more than a year after 9/11 to avoid the threat of liability of manufacturers and sellers of anti-terrorism technologies. Such technologies include detections systems, sensors and security services. \nPrior to the Act, a company could be held responsible for damages if that companys technology was impacted by an act of terrorism, according to DHS, which said this made the private sector extremely reluctant to deploy security technologies and services in civilian settings. By limiting liabilities, the Act sought to promote the development, commercialization, and deployment of such technologies. \nDHS has approved more than 800 applications for SAFETY Act liability protections, including some by National Football League and Major League Baseball stadiums, the Los Angeles Times reported. \nMGM lawyer Michael Doyen said there has apparently never been any litigation in which the SAFETY Act was invoked in its arguments. He said the Las Vegas shooting appears to have been the first act of mass violence at an event at which a DHS-certified service or technology was employed. \nDHS has not officially declared the shooting an act of terrorism.\nCraig Eiland, an attorney for hundreds of the shooting victims, said, CSC had nothing to do with Mandalay Bay not having security stop Stephen Paddock from unloading luggage with 23 assault rifles, carrying them up to his room and not noticing anything for three to five days. He added that the lawsuit is about immunizing MGM from liability and staying out of state courts.\nMGM spokeswoman, Debra DeShong, said, The federal court is an appropriate venue for these cases and provides those affected with the opportunity for a timely resolution. Years of drawn-out litigation and hearings are not in the best interest of victims, the community and those still healing.\nCongress provided that the federal courts were the correct place for such litigation relating to incidents of mass violence like this one, where security services approved by the Department of Homeland Security were provided, Deshrong said.\nSources: Congress.gov, Department of Homeland Security, Los Angeles Times, The New York Times, Twitter",

      "Content": "On Tuesday, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) sued California, its governor and attorney general over three state laws that the department says affect enforcement of federal immigration laws. The lawsuit alleges that the state laws, passed last year, are unconstitutional and have \"the purpose and effect of making it more difficult for federal immigration officers to carry out their responsibilities. California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said the laws were fully constitutional.\nThe lawsuit says the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution \"does not allow California to obstruct\" the federal governments ability to enforce laws. It cites the following three California laws that allegedly violate the clause:\n\n\tThe \"Immigrant Worker Protection Act\" that prohibits private California employers from \"voluntarily cooperating\" with federal requests for immigration-related information on employees.\n\tAssembly Bill 103 that creates a \"scheme that requires the Attorney General of California to investigate the immigration enforcement efforts of federal agents.\" \n\tSenate Bill 54 (SB 54), including the \"California Values Act,\" that \"limits the ability of state and local law enforcement officers\" to provide information to federal authorities on some immigrant detainees and to transfer them to federal immigration custody.SB 54 says including state and local agencies in federal immigration enforcement diverts already limited resources and blurs the lines of accountability between local, state, and federal governments.\n\nThe lawsuit said California's SB 54 law would \"require\" federal immigration officers to sometimes \"engage\" in \"dangerous efforts to re-arrest aliens.\" It said this would result in \"endangering immigration officers, the alien at issue, and others who may be nearby.\" When California passed SB 54, former U.S. Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. said on behalf of the state Senate that the federal government does not have the authority to make California officials help it enforce its immigration laws.\nWhen California Governor Jerry Brown signed the three bills into law in October, he said they provided a balance that will protect public safety while bringing a measure of comfort to those families who are now living in fear every day.\"\nU.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions spoke about the lawsuit Wednesday at an annual meeting of law enforcement officials in Sacramento, California. During his speech, Sessions said, California is using every power it has, and some it does not, to frustrate federal law enforcement. He added, So you can be sure Im going to use every power I have to stop them.\nAfter the speech, the Trump campaign reportedly sent an email to supporters saying, Americans across the country now can see that Democrats have officially become the party of obstruction, lawlessness, government shutdowns, and of putting illegal immigrants before American citizens The President is calling on you to stand by him in the face of such flagrant lawlessness.\nBrown and Becerra said after the speech that Sessions characterization of the state's laws was \"untrue. Brown described the law as a \"carefully balanced measure\" that had been endorsed by law enforcement, CNN reported. Referring to the lawsuit, Brown reportedly said, This is basically going to war against the state of California.\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said Wednesday that Californians will continue to proudly keep our doors open to the immigrants who make America more American. We will fight this sham lawsuit and will fight all cowardly attacks on our immigrant communities. \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrested 20,201 people in California during fiscal year 2017, 81 percent of whom had prior criminal convictions.\nAbout sanctuary cities\nSome California localities are so-called \"sanctuary cities. The term denotes non-compliance with federal statute 8 U.S.C. 1373  legislation that, among other things, requires local and state governments to provide federal authorities with peoples immigration status information. Some California cities passed legislation making them sanctuary cities before President Donald Trump's election, as San Francisco did in 1989.\nOakland is a self-proclaimed \"sanctuary city, according to the Los Angeles Times. In February, Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf sent an email to residents saying ICE officials were going to conduct a raid, which it did the following week. ICEs raid resulted in 232 arrests, the outlet reported. \nDuring the Sacramento speech, Sessions also criticized Schaafs actions, saying they may have led to some illegal immigrants not being captured and had needlessly endangered the lives of federal immigration officers. Schaaf said her email was meant to give all residents time to learn their rights and know their legal options. She added, We believe our community is safer when families stay together. The White House said last week that Schaafs actions were under review by the DOJ.\nSources: CNN, Fox News, The Los Angeles Times, The Washington Post",

Vicodin is a pain-relieving drug that combines acetaminophen and the opioid hydrocodone. \nMetz said Prince had no known Vicodin or fentanyl prescriptions. He said there was no evidence to suggest Prince knowingly ingested fentanyl and that law enforcement was unable to determine the source of the counterfeit pills.

      "Content": "On April 30, Colorado State University (CSU) police pulled two teenage brothers of Native American descent out of a campus tour and questioned them. Police were responding to a 911 call from a woman on the tour, who said the teenagers looked as if they dont belong. Police let the teens rejoin the tour after one of them showed the officers an email with a reservation for the tour. The university later tweeted, We deeply regret the unwelcoming and concerning experience they had while guests on our campus, and said it would change its tour policies, including providing guests with badges or lanyards.\nThe two brothers, Kanewakeron Thomas Gray, 19, and Skanahwati Lloyd Gray, 17, had joined the tour late after driving about seven hours from their home in New Mexico. The woman who called 911 mentioned their lateness to the dispatcher. She said the teens did not respond to some questions people asked of them, and that they were wearing black clothing with weird symbolism or wording on it. While on the tour, Thomas wore a black shirt and Lloyd wore a sweatshirt, both from death metal bands.\nThe woman reportedly said she thought the teens were lying. She said one of them laughed after she asked the other what he was thinking of studying. Thomas, the older of the two, said in an interview that he is interested in earning a doctorate in music, and his brother plans to major in visual arts.\nThe woman, who was touring the campus with her husband and at least two of her children, said, One of them had his left hand in his oversized sweatshirt the whole time. She added, Im probably being completely paranoid with everything thats happened. She said her husband told her another man on the tour also believes [the teens] dont belong. \nThe female campus police dispatcher asked if they were white males. The woman responded that she thought they were Hispanic and that one had said he is from Mexico.\nOn Friday, the university released the police report and one of the officers body camera footage from the incident, with some editing to blur the teens faces and delete audio portions. In the body cam footage, one officer tells Lloyd to get his hand out of his pocket, and then the officer pats down the pockets of Lloyds sweatshirt. One of the officers asked why the teens did not respond to questions on the tour, and Thomas said Lloyd is shy. Lloyd showed the police his ID and an email on his phone confirming that they had signed up for the campus tour.\nOne of the officers told the teens as he let them go, Sorry to take you away from the group. Have a good rest of your day. The tour had moved on and the teens were not able to rejoin it. The university said the tour guide was unaware that police had been called or responded, and the group had continued without the teens.\nCSU responds\nOn May 2, three administration vice presidents sent an email to students as part of their commitment to be transparent in communicating about issues related to race occurring on our campus. They said, this incident is sad and frustrating from nearly every angle, and that they deeply regret the experience of these students while they were guests on our campus.\nOn Friday, the universitys president, Dr. Tony Frank, said the school had been unsuccessful in contacting the Grays, and wanted to offer them reimbursement for their travel expenses and a V.I.P. tour of the campus. \nFrank said the school had been discussing potential changes to how it manages campus tours and that it would move as soon as possible to provide badges or lanyards for tour guests identifying them as visitors. He also said the school would have campus police contact tour guides if they wanted to talk to a tour member, and that tour guides would give introductions to people on their tours so that anyone with questions or concerns views the tour guide as the first point of contact.\nFrank also said, People of all races, gender identities, orientations, cultures, religions, heritages, and appearances belong [at CSU].\nThe Grays respond\nThomas said his family had not decided if the teens would return to the university or whether they would apply there. He said on Friday, We drove seven hours to pretty much get the cops called on us. \nOn Friday, the teens mother, Lorraine, said, My immediate thought was theyre being profiled because theyre different. Lorraine Gray is an indigenous activist, according to The Guardian.\nOne of the officers mentioned in his report that he spoke to Lorraine on the phone. He said, I explained to her that law enforcement is obligated to follow up on any call that we receive and that the reporting party was suspicious because of the boys actions alone.\nThe teens are originally from the Mohawk Nation of Akwesasne in New York and had moved to New Mexico about a decade ago.\nSources: CNN, Colorado State University, The Guardian, The New York Times, USA Today\n",

      "Content": "On Thursday, an international Joint Investigation Team (JIT) examining the crash of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 (MH17) in eastern Ukraine in 2014 said it was convinced that the 53rd Russian anti-aircraft missile brigade had fired the Buk missile that reportedly caused the plane to go down. The JIT said its conclusion was based on extensive comparative research of images that identified characteristics of the particular Buk launcher. Russia has denied involvement of its armed forces in the plane crash. The JIT includes officials from the Netherlands, Australia, Belgium, Malaysia and Ukraine.\nThe downing of the MH17 flight from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur in July 2014 killed 298 people from 17 countries. Russia and Ukraine were engaged in an armed conflict at the time, after Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in March 2014.\nFred Westerbeke, chief prosecutor of the National Prosecutor's Office of the Netherlands, said the Buk missile launcher \"was transported from the territory of the Russian Federation and was returned to that territory afterwards. He said, \"at the time this area [of Ukraine] was under control of pro-Russian separatists. \nThe Russian defense ministry said, Not a single anti-aircraft missile system from Russia has ever crossed the Russian-Ukrainian border.\"\nWesterbeke said, \"this raises questions such as to whether the brigade was actively involved in downing MH17. It is an important question which the JIT are still investigating.\" The JIT called for witnesses to come forward to help identify people who may have operated the missile system.\nRussias foreign ministry said the country had provided sizeable amounts of information to the JIT, including technical and design data on Buk missiles. The ministry also said it provided the JIT the results of a full-scale experiment carried out by the producer of this type of air defense weapon and primary data received by a radar station operating in the area in question. It added, \"No evidence has been presented [by the JIT] except for a colorful video based on information fabricated by bloggers from the Bellingcat agency, who were earlier caught distorting facts to prove Russias alleged involvement in the MH17 crash. Russian state-run media outlet TASS did not report additional information on what the foreign ministry referred to when it said distorting facts.\nBellingcat is a U.K.-based organization that uses open source and social media investigation to investigate a variety of subjects.\nRussias foreign ministry also said, we will continue to assist the investigation seeking to establish the cause of the MH17 crash and ensure that those responsible face a just punishment.\nIn October 2015, the Dutch Safety Board concluded that the plane had been downed by a Buk missile. In September 2016, the JIT issued a preliminary report saying it had irrefutable evidence that the missile had been brought from Russia and was fired from an area controlled by pro-Russian fighters.\nSources: BBC, CNN 1, CNN 2, Openbaar Ministerie, TASS",

      "Content": "Russia on Thursday requested consultations with the U.S. through the World Trade Organization (WTO) about the U.S. decision to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. The tariffs, which took effect March 23, include a 25 percent tariff on steel products and a 10 percent tariff on aluminum products. India, China and the EU have also petitioned the WTO for a similar tariff consultation with the U.S.\nAccording to the WTO, consultations allow member states to discuss a complaint and find a satisfactory solution without proceeding further with litigation. In their filings, Russia and the other countries said the U.S. tariffs are a safeguard measure and that the U.S. should compensate steel and aluminum exporters, as per WTO rules. The U.S. says the tariffs are not safeguard measures, AP reported, and President Donald Trump has said they are a matter of necessity for U.S. security.\nThe WTOs safeguard measure rules stipulate that the importers tariffs must be temporary, they may be imposed only when imports are found to cause or threaten serious injury to a competing domestic industry, and that the importer must compensate any WTO members whose trade is adversely affected.\nOn Wednesday, the WTO said the U.S. told India and the EU that it was open to consultations if they are not about safeguards.\nChinas filing to the WTO also included a dispute claim against the U.S. China said the tariffs are inconsistent with provisions of the WTO's General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 and of the Agreement on Safeguards.\nIf consultations have not resolved the dispute after 60 days, the complainant may request adjudication by a panel, according to the WTO. \nSources: AP, FT",

      "Content": "The National Hurricane Center (NHC) downgraded Hurricane Florence to a tropical depression on Monday with maximum sustained winds of 30 miles per hour (48 km/h). Authorities attributed at least 23 deaths to the storm: six in South Carolina and 17 in North Carolina. About 575,000 homes and businesses remained without power as of Monday, according to the National Weather Service.\nThe NHC projected the storm would continue to move north-northeast toward the New England area. Portions of southern New York and southern New England may experience two to four inches of rain, with a maximum of six inches possible in isolated areas. \nFlash flood warnings remain in effect for parts of central North Carolina and southern Virginia. Flash flood watches are also in effect for most other areas of North Carolina, northern South Carolina, portions of Western Virginia, southern and eastern West Virginia, central and western Maryland, central and western Pennsylvania, southern New York and southern New England. \nThe NHC also said Monday that tornadoes remain possible for northeast South Carolina, eastern and central North Carolina, parts of Virginia, western Maryland and southern Pennsylvania.\nEvacuation orders remain in effect for about 7,500 people living within a mile of the Cape Fear River and the Little River, and parts of the city of Fayetteville, North Carolina. People living in and around areas near Black Creek and Bennettsville in South Carolina have also been ordered to evacuate.\nPrior to the storms landfall, mandatory evacuation orders were issued for more than one million residents of coastal areas of North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia.\nMore effects from Florence \nNorth Carolina\nRising floodwaters caused a train derailment in Lilesville. Train officials said several rail cars derailed around 6 p.m. Sunday; some of the trains personnel were taken to the hospital with minor injuries. According to local news outlet WCCB, the train was carrying hazardous materials; none of the rail cars spilled their contents.\nFlooding on local roadways cut off the city of Wilmington from the rest of the state. Officials reportedly plan to airlift food and water to the citys nearly 120,000 residents. \nHundreds of roads in the state have closed due to flooding, including about 60 miles of Interstate 95. The Interstate runs about 1,917 miles (3,085 km) from Florida to Maine.\nAccording to the National Weather Service, local authorities in the towns of Landis and Creston warned residents that levees in those areas could be breached. Residents downstream of the Creston area levee, Headwaters Dam, were told to evacuate. As of Monday, the levees had not been breached.\nGov. Roy Cooper said emergency crews have rescued 2,600 people and more than 300 animals throughout North Carolina. Florence caused record rainfall in parts of the state, including up to 33.9 inches (86 cm) in the town of Swansboro. The states previous record of 24.06 inches (61 cm) was set during Hurricane Floyd in 1999.\nThe National Weather Service said flood waters may become contaminated from local poultry and pig farms. According to the North Carolina Pork Council, an aerial survey conducted Sunday showed that flood waters had reached portions of its farms in at least three locations. The Council also noted that there had been no reported breaches of treatment lagoons, which house animal waste, and no reported instances of lagoon contents spilling out.\nSouth Carolina\nThe South Carolina Emergency Management Division on Monday told residents to avoid contact with flood waters due to possible contamination from raw sewage and other hazardous substances.\nOn Sunday night, about two dozen people had to leave an evacuation center in the town of Cheraw after the building began to flood, local news station WCCB reported. The Cheraw Fire chief said the people were moved to Cheraw High School.\nMarion County administrator Tim Harper said about 100 people had been rescued from rising waters in the towns of Marion and Mullins.\nAccording to the South Carolina Department of Transportation, more than 100 roads in the state are closed due to flooding, downed power lines or fallen trees. Some bridges and roads have been washed out, the department said.\nRivers such as the Little Pee Dee, the Waccamaw, the Great Pee Dee, the Lumber and the Black may reach or exceed flood levels this week, the National Weather Service reported.\n\nSources: I-95 Coalition, NHC forecast, North Carolina Pork Council, NPR, SCDOT, SCEMD Twitter, The Weather Channel, WCCB",

The president said there were unrevealed Conflicts of Interest in Muellers team of investigators, and said the continued investigation could wrongfully impact Novembers midterm elections. \nThe special counsels office declined to comment on Trumps tweets, The New York Times reported.\nTrump tweeted on Monday morning, The Russia Witch Hunt is rapidly losing credibility. House Intelligence Committee found No Collusion, Coordination or anything else with Russia. So now the Probe says OK, what else is there? How about Obstruction for a made up, phony crime.There is no O, its called Fighting Back. \nThe House Intelligence Committee released its final report on alleged Russian interference on April 27, which said there was no evidence the Trump campaign conspired with Russia. The committee Democrats released a minority report that said the investigation concluded prematurely, and that supported the Intelligence Community Assessment regarding Russias alleged interference into the election.\nIn his next tweet, Trump wrote, The 13 Angry Democrats in charge of the Russian Witch Hunt are starting to find out that there is a Court System in place that actually protects people from injustice...and just wait till the Courts get to see your unrevealed Conflicts of Interest!\nMuellers investigation has 17 staff attorneys, twelve of whom are registered Democrats, according to independent verification by PolitiFact. A thirteenth wrote Im a Democrat in a 2012 opinion piece. Two others are registered to vote with no party affiliation chosen, and PolitiFact was unable to independently verify any affiliation for the other two. Mueller is a registered Republican. The Department of Justice is prohibited from discriminating in hiring practices on the basis of political affiliation, in accordance with the Civil Service Reform Act.\nTrumps comment about the court system may refer to a statement last Friday by U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis III, who told Muellers team, You dont really care about Mr. Manafort. You really care about what information Mr. Manafort can give you to lead you to Mr. Trump and an impeachment, or whatever. Paul Manafort is a former campaign manager for Trump who pleaded not guilty to charges of fraud, money laundering and tax evasion unrelated to the presidential campaign.\nTrump also tweeted, Is this Phony Witch Hunt going to go on even longer so it wrongfully impacts the Mid-Term Elections, which is what the Democrats always intended? Republicans better get tough and smart before it is too late! He did not provide evidence the investigation was phony or elaborate on how it might impact the midterm elections.\nMuellers investigation has at this point indicted Michael Flynn, Paul Manafort, Rick Gates, George Papadopoulos, Alex van der Zwaan, Richard Pinedo and 13 Russian nationals. Flynn, Gates, Papadopoulos, van der Zwaan and Pinedo pleaded guilty to various crimes including lying to the FBI.\nSources: Breitbart, CSRA, Fox News, Fox News, PolitiFact, The New York Times, The Washington Post",

Filber will testify in a case involving Israeli telecommunications company Bezeq, known as Case 4000.\nPolice are investigating whether the ministry illegally provided classified information to Bezeq executives, and whether the same executives illegally received $48 million in funds intended for Shaul Elovitch, Bezeqs controlling shareholder. Seven people in total, including Filber, have been arrested on charges of bribery, fraud, breach of trust and obstruction of justice in connection with the case. All have denied the allegations.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was communications minister during the period when the illegal transactions allegedly took place. Israeli media reported that Netanyahu allegedly received favorable media coverage from a Bezeq website known as Walla, in return for the classified information. He has not been named a suspect in Case 4000.\nLast week, Israeli police recommended that Netanyahu be indicted on charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust in two other cases known asCase 1000 and Case 2000. The Attorney General is to decide whether Netanyahu will be charged in those cases. The Attorney Generals office declined to comment on Case 4000.\nSources:CNN,Financial Times",

      "Content": "Over the weekend, U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted about former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who pleaded guilty to lying to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) on Friday, as part of special counsel Robert Muellers investigation into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Trump also tweeted about his firing of former FBI director James Comey.\nOn Friday, retired Lt. Gen. Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his conversations with Sergey Kislyak, the Russian ambassador in Washington at the time. He also agreed to cooperate with Muellers investigation, Flynn said on Friday. Flynn falsely denied that he had asked Kislyak not to escalate the situation in response to sanctions that then-President Barack Obama imposed on Russia in December for Russias alleged interference in the election, according to court documents. Flynn also falsely stated to the FBI that the ambassador had not told him how Russia planned to vote on an upcoming United Nations resolution, the court document said. \nA tweet from Trumps account on Saturday read, I had to fire General Flynn because he lied to the Vice President and the FBI. He has pled guilty to those lies. It is a shame because his actions during the transition were lawful. There was nothing to hide! \nFlynn resigned from Trumps administration in February for what he said in his resignation letter was inadvertently briefing Vice President Mike Pence and others with incomplete information regarding his phone calls with the Russian Ambassador.\nThe ranking Democratic member on the Senate Intelligence Committee, Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.), and other politicians said that Trump should have addressed the situation sooner if he knew that Flynn had lied to the FBI at the time of Flynns resignation, as the Saturday tweet could indicate. Then on Sunday, Trumps personal lawyer John Dowd said he was responsible for drafting the tweet and had given it to Trumps social media director. Dowd called it sloppy.\nIn June, Comey testified that on Feb. 14, the day after Flynn resigned, Trump told the then-FBI director, I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. The president fired Comey as the FBI head in May. Trump denies he told Comey to stop investigating Flynn or fired Comey because of the investigation. I never asked Comey to stop investigating Flynn, Trump repeated in a tweet on Sunday morning, calling the story Fake News.\nTrump also tweeted on Sunday that the FBIs reputation is in Tatters - worst in History, adding we will bring it back to greatness.\nSources: AP, CNN, Fox News, The Washington Post",

On Monday, a U.N. envoy brought aid to Eastern Ghouta during the ceasefire. A spokesperson for the U.N.s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said shelling occurred during the nine hours that the envoy was there, and not all trucks were offloaded before the convoy left for security reasons. \nOn Tuesday, local medics reported treating civilians in Eastern Ghouta for respiratory issues after a possible chlorine gas attack.

      "Content": "Sajid Javid was named the new U.K. Home Secretary on Monday, after Amber Rudd resigned late on Sunday. Rudd resigned after allegations that she lied to Parliament about immigration deportations. \nRudd had originally told parliament there were no national quotas for deporting illegal immigrants, then later said they did exist. British newspaper The Guardian reported on Friday that a memo within the Home Office, on which Rudd was copied, mentioned a target of achieving 12,800 enforced returns in 2017-18, saying we have exceeded our target of assisted returns.\nIn Rudds resignation letter, she said she inadvertently misled lawmakers and had become aware of information provided to my office which makes mention of targets. I should have been aware of this, and I take full responsibility that I was not.\nThe Windrush Generation\nRudds resignation followed ongoing media coverage criticizing the U.K.s handling of legal and illegal immigration of the so-called Windrush generation. The Windrush generation is named after the ship MV Empire Windrush, which brought Caribbean immigrants to the U.K. after World War II. \nCaribbean immigrants were invited to the U.K. from 1948 to 1971 as part of a program to address labor shortages. Then in 1971, an Immigration Act granted citizens from Commonwealth countries who were already living in the U.K. a permanent residency permit, which gave them indefinite leave to remain in the country. Many people from the so-called Windrush generation arrived on their parents passports and never became citizens, according to Al Jazeera. \nIn 2012, the U.K. implemented rules that require doctors, landlords and employers to check peoples immigration status. Some immigrants who have not had adequate paperwork, including some from the Windrush generation, have reportedly been denied medical benefits, lost jobs and faced deportation. The rules affect an estimated 50,000 long-term U.K. residents, Al Jazeera reported. \nJavid, the son of a Pakistani immigrant, told parliament on Monday that hed do whatever it takes to address the immigration issues in the U.K. I want to start by making a pledge, a pledge to those from the Windrush generation who have been in this country for decades and yet have struggled to navigate through the immigration system. This never should have been the case and I will do whatever it takes to put it right, he said.\nU.K. Prime Minister Theresa May was the Home Secretary when the changes to the immigration policy, associated with Windrush, were implemented, The Washington Post reported. On April 18, May issued an apology to 12 Caribbean countries for the treatment of the Windrush generation. She is scheduled to meet with her new cabinet on Tuesday. \nSources: Al Jazeera, BBC, The Guardian, The Washington Post",

      "Content": "On Thursday, the National Day of Prayer, President Donald Trump signed an executive order titled Establishment of a White House Faith and Opportunity Initiative. A White House fact sheet said the order was to ensure that the faith-based and community organizations that form the bedrock of our society have strong advocates in the White House and throughout the Federal Government.\nThe order revoked two previous executive orders, including one from 2001 titled Establishment of White House Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives. It also replaced some of the wording in past executive orders, such as replacing White House Faith and Opportunity Initiative with White House Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives.\nThe Fact Sheet said the order will:\n\n\tprovide recommendations on the policy agenda affecting faith-based and community programs; \n\tprovide recommendations on programs and policies that may have more effective solutions to poverty with faith-based and community organization involvement;\n\tapprise the Administration of any failures of the executive branch to comply with religious liberty protections under law; and \n\treduce the burdens on the exercise of free religion. \n\nThe initiative is to be led by a new position: Advisor to the White House Faith and Opportunity Initiative. The executive order said the advisor will make recommendations regarding changes to policies, programs, and practices that affect the delivery of services by faith-based and community organizations. The order specifies that executive departments and agencies that do not have a Center for Faith and Opportunity Initiative will designate a liaison as a point of contact for the initiative.\nTrump said regarding the order, \"We take this step because we know that in solving the many many problems and our great challenges, faith is more powerful than government and nothing is more powerful than God.\nSources: CBS News, White House Executive Order, White House Fact Sheet",

      "Content": "The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) was implemented by the United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs in 1970. Its primary goals are to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons, to encourage nuclear disarmament, and to promote the peaceful uses of nuclear energy.\nA total of 191 of the worlds 195 countries have joined the NPT, including five countries that currently have nuclear-weapon arsenals. The nuclear-armed countries in the treaty are China, France, Russia, the U.K. and the U.S., according to the Arms Control Association (ACA), a U.S.-based nonpartisan organization. Additionally, four countries that are not party to the treaty have nuclead weapons: India, Israel, Pakistan and North Korea, the ACA reported, based on information from the U.S. State Department and other sources.\nThe NPT is one of several disarmament treaties maintained by the U.N. The organization also has treaties banning nuclear testing, chemical weapons and other types of weapons.\nWhat does the NPT say?\nThe NPT includes several directives with which its signatories are expected to comply. The U.N. works with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which inspects nuclear test facilities or weapons sites, to ensure that all participating countries are complying with the treaty. Below is a summary of the NPTs text.\nArticle 1: Any nuclear-weapon state participating in the treaty cannot transfer nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices to another recipient, or encourage any non-nuclear-weapon state to manufacture or acquire nuclear weapons.\nArticle 2: Any non-nuclear-weapon state participating in the treaty cannot accept any transfer of nuclear weapons or nuclear explosives, and cannot manufacture or acquire nuclear weapons.\nArticle 3: Non-nuclear-weapon state participants must agree to allow the IAEA to inspect facilities to ensure compliance with the NPT, and each participant must abide by safeguards established by the IAEA when handling fissionable material, or material that is capable of undergoing nuclear fission.\nArticle 4: State participants can still use and develop nuclear technology for peaceful purposes. States with peaceful nuclear technology can work with other participants, including those without nuclear power, to further develop peaceful nuclear technology.\nArticle 5: State participants must ensure that any potential benefits from any peaceful applications of nuclear explosions would be made available to non-nuclear-weapon states participating in the NPT on a non-discriminatory basis.\nArticle 6: State participants must agree to cease the nuclear arms race and to nuclear disarmament.\nArticle 7: Any group of states can formulate and agree to their own regional treaties on nuclear weapons in their respective territories.\nArticle 8: State participants can propose amendments to the NPT that could then be voted on by all NPT signatories.\nArticle 9: Any state can sign on to the treaty.\nArticle 10: Any state can withdraw from the treaty if extraordinary events related\nto the treatys subject matter have jeopardized the supreme interests of its country. The country must give the U.N. three months notice and detail the extraordinary events the country faces before leaving the NPT.\nArticle 11: Copies of the treaty would be made available in English, Russian, French, Spanish and Chinese.\nWhat happens when a state violates the NPT?\nEach year, the U.N. issues a disarmament yearbook detailing topics such as complaints from state participants regarding alleged treaty violations, nuclear weapon stockpile reductions, disarmament milestones and the status of disarmament, or lack thereof, in other parts of the world. \nAlthough the treatys text does not specify actions the U.N. may take toward a state for violating the treaty, it has issued sanctions on countries such as North Korea for treaty violations. North Korea had signed on to the NPT in 1985 but formally withdrew in 2003. In the 2017 disarmament yearbook, the U.N. called on North Korea to reenter the NPT.\n\nSources: Arms Control, UN Disarmament Yearbook 2017, UN NPT",

      "Content": "Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced charges against 601 people on Thursday for alleged participation in health care fraud activities, saying it was the largest health care fraud enforcement action in American history. The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) alleged the defendants were involved in a total of more than $2 billion in false billings to insurers for medically unnecessary prescription drugs and compounded medications that were never purchased or distributed to beneficiaries. \nThe alleged fraud involved false billing to Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE military health insurance and private insurance companies, according to the DOJ. The 601 defendants include 165 doctors, nurses and other licensed medical professionals. \nOf the defendants, 162, including 76 doctors, were charged for participating in prescribing and distributing opioids and other narcotics. The charges, while announced together, include a number of unrelated cases, including 84 opioid cases involving more than 13 million illegal doses of opioids.\nSessions made the announcement along with Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Alex Azar, as well as representatives from the Drug Enforcement Agency, FBI and other federal agencies.\nHealthcare fraud touches every corner of the United States and not only costs taxpayers money, but also can have deadly consequences, said FBI Deputy Director Bowdich. He thanked law enforcement agencies for their investigations. \nThe HHS also announced Thursday that between July 2017 and the present, it has excluded 2,700 health care providers from participation in any federal health care programs, such as Medicare, for alleged misconduct. That figure includes 587 providers who were allegedly involved in opioid diversion and abuse. Drug diversion is generally defined as the process when legal distribution of prescription drugs is disrupted and the drugs are then distributed illegally. \nApproximately 64,000 people died in the U.S. from drug overdoses in 2016, The Washington Post reported. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there were more than 42,000 synthetic opioid-related overdose deaths in the U.S. that year.\nLast year, the DOJ charged more than 400 people for allegedly participating in health care fraud activities totaling approximately $1.3 billion in false billings.\nSources: DOJ Press Release, Reuters, The Washington Post",

In 2014, he said he would not aspire to hold the position of prime minister. \nIn 2015, Armenia voted in a referendum to change its government from a presidential to a parliamentary system, with the prime minister role taking some of the powers the president role once held. \nOn April 17 of this year, eight days after the end of Sargsyans presidency, parliament voted 76 to 17 with no abstentions to make him prime minister. At least 80 people were arrested during demonstrations on that day and the days prior, Radio Free Europe reported.\nThe protests were led by opposition leader Nikol Pashinian, AP reported. He said the prime minister lacks legitimacy and has earned the hatred of Armenians. On Sunday, Pashinian attended talks with Sargsyan and called for the prime minister to resign. The opposition leader was arrested after the meeting, and then released on Monday. \nWhen Sargsyan announced his decision, he said, Nikol Pashinian was right, adding that the movement on the streets is against my rule and he was complying with their demands. Pashinian said Sargsyans resignation was a victory.\nThe government of Armenia, formerly part of the Soviet Union, named former Prime Minister Karen Karapetian as acting prime minister.

      "Content": "Natural disasters can be quite costly in terms of both the loss of human life, and the economic costs of repairs and replacement of damaged property. Both sets of figures can be challenging to compare across disasters due to discrepancies in the methodology used to calculate the totals. \nDeath tolls, for example, at times count only direct deaths and in other cases count indirect deaths, and these figures can be measured in various ways. Direct casualties refer to those killed immediately and directly from the event. Direct deaths could include drownings in floods and hurricanes, people crushed by debris, trapped in fire and suffocating, and other immediate deaths. The category of indirect deaths is broader and would include deaths resulting from prolonged power outages, inability to access care, and sufficient food, water or medical supplies. Indirect deaths could also include fatalities from medical conditions such as heart attacks triggered by the shock of the disaster. \nThe estimated costs of damage also vary. For a single event, estimates by agencies and organizations can may vary by several billion dollars. \nYet even with these limitations, its useful to compare major disasters in recent U.S. history. Weve compiled a outline of the five most costly natural disasters on U.S. soil over the past two decades.* (Note that while in this time period, all the most costly disasters were hurricanes, other have caused damages in the billions, such as the 1994 Los Angeles earthquake or the 1988 drought in the midwestern U.S.)\n2005: Hurricane Katrina\nHurricane Katrina mostly occurred in Louisiana and Mississippi, but also in Florida, Georgia and Alabama. New Orleans sustained the most damage. \nEstimated death toll: 1,833 direct and indirect deaths, according to estimates by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA.\nEstimated damage: $161 billion, according NOAA estimates.\n2017: Hurricane Maria\nHurricane Maria made landfall on the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico in September 2017. It also affected the U.S. Virgin Islands and non-U.S. territories including the Dominican Republic, the Bahamas and more. \nEstimated death toll: 2,975 direct and indirect deaths in Puerto Rico, according to the governors official death count. The count was initially lower and then was raised in August 2018 to reflect the findings in a government-funded independent study by George Washington University.\nEstimated damage: $90 billion, according to NOAA estimates.\n2017: Hurricane Harvey\nHurricane Harvey made landfall in Texas in August 2017. After being downgraded, it also passed over Louisiana, Arkansas, Tennessee and Kentucky. \nEstimated death toll: 68 direct deaths and about 35 indirect deaths (more than 100 total), according to a NOAA report.\nEstimated damage: $125 billion, according to NOAA estimates. \n2012: Hurricane Sandy\nHurricane Sandy affected many U.S. states and countries, from Jamaica to Canada. In the U.S., the majority of the damage was in New York. \nEstimated death toll: 72 direct deaths in the U.S., as part of a total 147 direct deaths in all affected areas, according to NOAA. In the U.S. an additional 87 indirect deaths occurred, NOAA reported. \nEstimated damage: $71 billion in damage in the U.S., according to NOAA estimates. \n2017: Hurricane Irma\nHurricane Irma primarily affected Florida, but also Puerto Rico and other areas in the Caribbean, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, South Carolina, and Tennessee. \nEstimated death toll: 47 direct deaths, including 10 in the U.S., according to NOAA, plus an additional 82 indirect deaths, 77 of which were in Florida. \nEstimated damage: $50 billion, according to NOAA estimates. \n\n*For consistency, NOAA figures have been used whenever possible. \n\nSources: AP, CNN, CNN, GW Puerto Rico Study, NCBI, NOAA - Disaster Costs, NOAA - Harvey Report, NOAA - Irma Report, NOAA - Katrina Report, NOAA - Sandy Presentation, NOAA - Sandy Report, World Vision, World Vision",

Pfizers revenue in 2017 was $52.55 billion.\nDrug prices\nPfizer announced on Tuesday that the pre-July 1 prices would remain in effect until either the end of the year, or when Trump implements a blueprint to strengthen the healthcare system and provide more access for patents, whichever comes first. The company said it would return the drug prices to their pre-July 1 levels a soon as technically possible. It said the price decreases it had implemented on some drugs on July 1 would remain in effect.\nTrump tweeted on Monday about Pfizers drug price increases, prior to the companys announcement. Pfizer  elsewhere. We will respond!\nTrump tweeted on Tuesday, Just talked with Pfizer CEO and [Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar] on our drug pricing blueprint. Pfizer is rolling back price hikes, so American patients dont pay more. We applaud Pfizer for this decision and hope other companies do the same. Great news for the American people!\nAzar said Pfizers decision was constructive, professional [and] appropriate.\nIn May of this year, Trump announced a blueprint towards reducing drug prices. On May 30, he said within two weeks, some pharmaceutical companies would announce voluntary massive drops in prices. The White House has not announced other companies lowering prices since then.\nPfizer increased some drug prices earlier this year, on medications such as Viagra, Lipitor, Xanax and Chantix. Those price increases would stay in effect, CNN reported. On Jan. 1, Pfizer raised the price of Viagra by 9.5 percent, and then on July 1 the company raised its price again, by 9.4 percent. The second price increase would be reversed with the companys Tuesday announcement.\nA Wells Fargo Securities report said manufacturers increased the prices of 104 drugs in June and the first two days of July.\nSources: CNN, Pfizer 1, Pfizer 2, Reuters, The New York Times",

      "Content": "A U.S.-led drone strike killed Pakistani Taliban leader Mullah Fazlullah in Afghanistan on its border with Pakistan, the Afghan defense ministry announced on Friday. Fazlullah had led the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), a separate group from the Afghanistan Taliban, since 2013. \nI confirm that Mullah Fazlullah, leader of the Pakistani Taliban, has been killed in a joint air operation [with the U.S.] in the border area of Marawara district of Kunar province, said Afghan Defense Ministry spokesman Mohammad Radmanish. He said the drone strike occurred around 9 a.m. local time on Thursday, and also killed two other armed fighters in the Marawara district, near the border. \nA local lawmaker, Sakhi Mashwani, provided a different death toll, saying Fazlullah and five other armed fighters were killed when the drone strike hit their vehicle. He said dozens of TTP associates, including Fazlullahs brother, gathered to pray after the strike in the Ghaziabad district of Kunar province. \nThe TTP confirmed in a statement that Fazlullah was killed, according to Turkish news outlet Anadolu Agency.\nAl Jazeera reported that it was unable to independently verify the deaths, due to the remote location of Kunar province. \nU.S. Forces-Afghanistan spokesman Lt. Col. Martin ODonnell said in a statement that the U.S. performed a counterterrorism strike targeting a senior leader of a designated terrorist organization near the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. The statement did not confirm any fatalities or name Fazlullah. Later, an official at the NATO-led Resolute Support Mission in Afghanistan confirmed Fazlullah had been killed. \nODonnells statement said the drone strike did not violate a ceasefire agreement that Afghanistan had announced earlier this month. The government had said it would not make offensive strikes against the Afghan Taliban until June 20, the Islamic holiday of Eid al-Fitr. As previously stated, the ceasefire does not include U.S. counter-terrorism efforts against [the Islamic State and al-Qaida] and other regional and international terrorist groups, ODonnells statement said. \n\nPakistans military and ministry of foreign affairs did not comment on the drone strike. \nThe Pakistani Taliban\nFazlullah took over TTP leadership when its previous leader, Hakimullah Mehsud, was killed in a U.S. drone strike in November 2013. \nThe TTP led an armed insurgent campaign in Pakistan to establish Sharia law (Islamic law) for about a decade starting in 2007. Following Pakistani military campaigns, many remaining TTP members moved to the Afghanistan side of the border. \nAccording to the Indian research firm South Asia Terrorism Portal, in 2017, TTP and other armed groups killed at least 748 people, including both civilian and security forces. At the TTPs peak in 2012, it was responsible for at least 3,739 deaths, the firm reported. Pakistans military estimates it has killed 4,000 TTP fighters since 2013. \nFazlullahs TTP claimed responsibility for a 2014 attack on a Pakistani school that killed more than 140 children and teachers. Fazlullah is suspected to have ordered the 2012 shooting of Malala Yousafzai, who was 15 at the time and later won the Nobel Peace Prize for her work advocating for education for girls. He reportedly conducted public beheadings, including those of police officers. Fazlullahs age is unknown, but he was believed to be in his late 30s at the time of his death, The Associated Press reported. \nThe TTP is separate from the Afghan Taliban that governed Afghanistan before the U.S. overthrew it in 2001.\nThe U.S. has alleged that Pakistan has allowed the Afghan Taliban to remain within its borders. Pakistan denies this and alleges Afghanistan has allowed the TTP to stay within its borders. \nSources: Al Jazeera, AP, Reuters, Stanford Militant Mapping",

      "Content": "On Wednesday, the U.S. Treasury Department issued sanctions against Turkeys ministers of justice and interior over Turkeys 2016 arrest of American pastor Andrew Brunson after a failed coup in the country that year. Brunson was accused of aiding armed terrorist organizations and obtaining confidential government information for political and military espionage, according to the U.S. Treasury Department. Brunson could be jailed for up to 35 years in Turkey if found guilty after his trial resumes in October. He has denied the espionage charges.\nThe two sanctioned Turkish officials, Justice Minister Abdulhamit Gul and Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu, played leading roles in the organizations responsible for the arrest and detention of Brunson, the Treasury Department said. These officials serve as leaders of Turkish government organizations responsible for implementing Turkeys serious human rights abuses, it added.\nWhite House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said that as a result of the sanctions, any property or interest in property of both ministers within U.S. jurisdiction is blocked and U.S. persons are generally prohibited from engaging in transactions with them.\nWe've seen no evidence that Pastor Brunson has done anything wrong, Sanders also said. We believe he's a victim of unfair and unjust detention. \nU.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin called the detention unacceptable, adding that President Donald Trump has made it abundantly clear that the United States expects Turkey to release him immediately.\nTurkey's foreign ministry said it had shared necessary information with the U.S. about Brunson, and said the case should be decided by the Turkish judiciary. The ministry previously said U.S. requests for Turkey to release Brunson were unacceptable.\nAuthorities have arrested more than 50,000 people in Turkey since a failed coup attempt against President Recep Tayyip Erdoans government in July 2016, BBC reported. Twenty Americans are among those charged with crimes in relation to the failed coup, according to The New York Times. \nErdoan has said Pennsylvania-based Turkish Muslim cleric Fethullah Glen was responsible for the coup, which Glen denies. Erdoan has said he would exchange Glen for Brunson with the U.S., BBC reported. \nBrunson, 50, is originally from North Carolina and has lived in Turkey for 23 years, Fox News reported. He lived there with his wife and three children while he was pastor of the Izmir Resurrection Church, with a congregation of about two dozen. He was arrested in October 2016 and released to home detention for health reasons last week. \nSources: BBC, Fox News, The New York Times, U.S. Treasury Department",

      "Content": "Andrs Manuel Lpez Obrador claimed victory in Mexicos presidential election on Sunday, after the other candidates conceded the election. The president elect, commonly known by the acronym of his initials AMLO, addressed supporters in Mexico City on Sunday night. Today, they have recognized our victory, he said. \nRicardo Anaya, of the PAN party, Jos Antonio Meade, who ran as the ruling PRI party candidate, and Jaime Rodrguez Caldern conceded after polls closed at 9 p.m. EDT. Exit polls had shown Lpez Obrador as winning 53 to 59 percent of the vote. Incumbent President Enrique Pea Nieto also called to congratulate Lpez Obrador on Sunday night and said he would work towards a smooth transition. \nAccording to the Mexican National Electoral Institute (NEI), with 80 percent of the votes counted as of 9:30 pm EDT Monday, Lpez Obrador was winning 53 percent of the vote. The candidate with the second most votes, Anaya, had 22.6 percent, followed by Meade with 15.7 percent, according to the NEI figures. Final results are expected between July 2 and July 8 at midnight, according to the NEI. Eighty-nine million Mexicans were registered to vote, CNN reported. \nSundays election will also determine hundreds of federal and state legislators, mayors and eight governors across the country.\nLpez Obrador, 64, unsuccessfully ran for the presidency twice before and served as the mayor of Mexico City from 2000 to 2005. Lpez Obradors founded the National Regeneration Movement (Morena) party in 2014, after leaving another party. He is scheduled to be sworn into office for on Dec. 1. Mexican presidents are constitutionally limited to a single six-year term. Presidents are elected by popular vote and there is no run-off system, according to the NEI. \nThe PRI governed Mexico for the 71 years between 1929 and 2000, and then PRI candidate Pea Nieto won the presidency in 2012.\nEconomic and security proposals\n\nLpez Obrador has proposed reviewing existing contracts under which some of the oil sector was privatized during Pea Nietos tenure. Prior to the election, he said he would reduce the presidential salary by one-half and continue living in his own house if elected president. Im going to govern by example, with austerity, he said.\nHe also said he would reduce poverty and unemployment, and eliminate Mexicos secret service and intelligence agency. The policies weve been applying for the past 30 years havent worked, Lpez Obrador said at a rally on Wednesday, the last official day of campaigning before the election. Thats why were going to send their policies to the dustbin of history.\nLpez Obrador has said he would implement agricultural subsidies, higher pensions, and monetary grants or apprenticeships for young people who are not working or in school, according to Shannon ONeil of the Council on Foreign Relations.\nOn Sunday night in his victory speech, Lpez Obrador said, More than through the use of force, we will tend to the causes that give rise to insecurity and violence, noting that he begin to develop a plan for reconciliation and peace with the input of rights groups, religious leaders and the United Nations. He hasnt committed to any specific plans for the goal.\nLast December, Lpez Obrador had mentioned the possibility of offering amnesty deals for criminals, such as cartel members, as part of peace negotiations. Olga Snchez Cordero, the woman Lpez Obrador has proposed as an interior minister, said that any amnesty proposals would be put to a public referendum and sent to Congress only with public support. Snchez Cordero also said longer-term goals include decriminalizing marijuana for recreational use or growing opium for medicinal purposes. \nRelations with the US\nLpez Obrador said, we are conscious of the need to maintain good relations with the United States. The president-elect thanked President Donald Trump for his congratulations via Twitter on Sunday night. Trump had said he very much looked forward to working with Lpez Obrador.\nWe are never going to disrespect the U.S. government, because we want them to respect us, Lopez Obrador said in an interview on Monday morning. At the appropriate moment, we are going to get in touch, to reach an understanding with the Trump administration. Lpez Obrador also said he supports renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with Canada and the U.S., noting he would not interfere in negotiations until he takes office. \nIssues in Mexico\n\nA 2017 Pew Research Center survey of 1,000 Mexicans found that 13 percent were satisfied and 85 percent dissatisfied with the way things were going in their country. The top eight very big problems identified by survey participants were crime, corrupt political leaders, drug cartel-related violence, rising prices, corrupt police officers, lack of employment opportunities, poor-quality schools, and the gap between wealthy and poor people.\n\nThere were a record 25,000 murders in Mexico last year, according to AFP. Etellekt, a Mexican political analysis consulting company, reported 113 candidates, current and former politicians and people attempting to run for office have been killed since September, including 48 of candidates for local office. Three hundred candidates, current and former politicians have experienced physical aggression during that time, according to Etellekt. \n\nAccording to the Mexican government, 43.6 percent of the countrys population was poor in 2016 (equivalent to 53.4 million out of a total 122 million), while 7.6 percent was in extreme poverty, meaning they could not afford basic items. In 2014, the government defined the poverty line as living on no more than $2,542 pesos ($157.70) per month in cities, and $1,615 pesos (about $100) in rural areas, with incomes for extreme poverty amounting to about half those numbers. In its poverty calculations, the government also considers other factors such as healthcare and education, Reuters reported.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2018, the Mexican unemployment rate was 3.2 percent, according to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). OECD notes that unemployed people are those who report that they are without work, that they are available for work and that they have taken active steps to find work in the last four weeks. Individuals who have stopped looking for work are not included in the unemployment numbers.\nSources: AP, BBC, Reuters, Reuters",

The injunction ordered parts of DACA to remain in place, challenging the administrations stated plans to rescind the program. The latest decision means that while the legal case is pending, individuals who are currently part of DACA can continue to work legally in the U.S. and renew their status, which expires every two years. \nThe administration had also appealed the ruling with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. No dates have been set for hearing arguments, though lawyers have been given dates through April to file briefs. After the appeals court ruling, the case could be returned to the Supreme Court. \nIf Congress passes legislation to grant current and potential DACA recipients legal status, then further court rulings will be unnecessary. There has been a bipartisan effort in the Senate to legislate a path to citizenship for DACA recipients, although the latest bill proposed did not pass. Ending DACA would potentially make 800,000 young adults currently under the program eligible for deportation. \nFor more information on DACA, see the context here.\nSources: The Associated Press, The New York Times, SCOTUSblog",

The non-binding vote was in response to U.S. President Donald Trumps Dec. 6 decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and call on the U.S. State Department to prepare to move the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv. \nThursdays resolution, drafted by Turkey and Yemen, demanded that all States comply with Security Council resolutions regarding the Holy City of Jerusalem, and not recognize any actions or measures contrary to those resolutions. It also called upon member states to refrain from the establishment of diplomatic missions in Jerusalem, in accordance with U.N. Security Council resolution 478, adopted in 1980.\nTurkey and Yemen requested the emergency session of the General Assembly after the U.S. vetoed a U.N. Security Council resolution on Monday. That resolution, drafted by Egypt, expressed deep regret at recent decisions concerning the status of Jerusalem. The other 14 nations of the Security Council voted yes to that resolution.\nOf the 193 nations of the General Assembly, 128 voted for Thursdays resolution, nine voted against, 35 abstained and 21 were not present to cast a vote. The countries that voted against the resolution were the U.S., Israel, the Federated States of Micronesia, Guatemala, Honduras, the Marshall Islands, Nauru, Palau, and Togo. Some of the countries that abstained were Argentina, Australia, Canada, Colombia, Czech Republic, Hungary, Mexico, Philippines, Poland, Rwanda, South Sudan and Uganda.\nAfter the vote, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel completely rejects the resolution. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said the vote was a victory for Palestine.\nPrior to the vote, U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley wrote in a letter to General Assembly members, The [U.S.] president will be watching this vote carefully and has requested I report back on those who voted against us. She also said the U.S. will remember the day of the vote when its called upon to make the worlds largest contribution to the United Nations, and so many countries come calling on us... to pay even more and to use our influence for their benefit.\nAmerica will put our embassy in Jerusalem, Haley said. It is the right thing to do.\nThe U.S. will use U.N. votes as one factor in our foreign relations, according to a statement Haleys office released after the vote. Its not going to be the only factor, or even necessarily the number one factor, but it will no longer be ignored.\nSources: Haaretz, Reuters, The Associated Press, The New York Times, UN News Centre",

U.S. Representative Al Green (D-Tex.) had filed the two impeachment articles in October. \nMinority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) issued a joint statement after Green introduced the articles to the House on Wednesday. The statement referenced Congressional committees investigations on alleged coordination between Trumps presidential campaign and Russian officials during the 2016 presidential election, saying the investigations should be allowed to continue. Now is not the time to consider articles of impeachment. Greens articles did not reference the investigations. \nThe articles were titled Article I - Associating the Presidency with White Nationalism, Neo-Nazism and Hatred and Article II  Inciting Hatred and Hostility. On Wednesday, Green said Trump has allegedly undermined the integrity of his office and has sown discord among the people of the United States. In a letter to lawmakers ahead of the vote, Green said, What are we going to do about it? The answer is: impeachment for his high misdemeanors, which need not be a crime.\"\nIn the articles, Green outlined incidents in which Trump made statements or took action relating to groups of people, including African-Americans, Muslims, Puerto Ricans, transgender individuals, football players and members of the Klu Klux Klan. \nSources: NPR, Fox News",

      "Content": "The Senate Intelligence Committee released a summary of some of its findings on the January 2017 Intelligence Community Assessment (ICA) on alleged Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. The seven-page summary released on Tuesday by Committee Chairman Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) said the committee concluded the ICA was a sound intelligence product. The summary noted that the ICA did not address the topic of possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.\nThe ICA was published by the Director of National Intelligence and assessed Russian Activities and Intentions in Recent U.S. Elections. Among other conclusions, the document said that the National Security Agency (NSA), FBI and CIA assessed with high confidence that Russian President Vladimir Putin had ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the U.S. presidential election.\nThe summary released by Burr said, The Committee has spent the last 16 months reviewing the sources, tradecraft and analytic work underpinning the Intelligence Community Assessment and sees no reason to dispute the conclusions. \nThe summary also said that after the committees comprehensive report was complete, a declassified version of it would be released to the public. The committee announced its initial conclusions in May and made recommendations at the time to address vulnerabilities in U.S. election processes for example, irregularities with voting machines.\nRegarding possible political pressure on intelligence agency assessments, the summary said, \"In all the interviews of those who drafted and prepared the ICA, the committee heard consistently that analysts were under no politically motivated pressure to reach any conclusions. All analysts expressed that they were free to debate, object to content, and assess confidence levels, as is normal and proper for the analytic process.\"\nThe summary mentioned the difference in confidence levels between the NSA, which assessed with moderate confidence, and the CIA and FBI, which assessed with high confidence, that Putin and the Russian Government aspired to help President-elect Trump's election chances when possible by discrediting Secretary Clinton and publicly contrasting her unfavorably to him. The committee said it found \"the analytical disagreement was reasonable, transparent, and openly debated among the agencies. \nThe summary also addressed whether the Steele dossier, a document prepared by former British spy Christopher Steele that made unverified allegations that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election in coordination with Trumps campaign, may have influenced the intelligence assessments. All individuals the Committee interviewed verified that the dossier did not in any way inform the analysis in the ICA - including the key findings - because it was unverified information and had not been disseminated as serialized intelligence reporting, the summary said. \nThe Washington Post reported that the committee may later release assessments of the Obama administrations conduct related to alleged Russian interference efforts, the role of social media in the alleged interference efforts, and whether there was collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.\nHouse Intelligence Committee report\nIn April, the House Intelligence Committee released a partially redacted version of a final report on its investigation into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. The report was authored by the Republican majority of the committee. The committee Democrats released a separate, unclassified Minority Views report the same day. \nThe majority document concluded there were failings in intelligence procedures and technique used in the ICA, specifically in judgments regarding Russian President Vladimir Putins strategic objectives for disrupting the U.S. election. The minority report said the minority found no evidence that calls into question the quality and reliability of the ICAs underlying reporting and key judgments.\nSources: CNN, Director of National Intelligence, Senator Burr 1, Senator Burr 2, The Washington Post",

      "Content": "The Pentagon said Wednesday that it had disinvited China from participating in the multinational RimPac naval exercises that the U.S. is organizing for this summer. The Pentagon said the decision was a response to Chinas military presence in the South China Sea. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said the South China Sea islands are Chinese territory and its military activities are normal trainings.\nThe disinvitation was an initial response to Chinas continued militarization of the South China Sea, said Marine Lt. Col. Christopher Logan, a Pentagon spokesman. Chinas behavior is inconsistent with the principles and purposes of the RimPac exercise.\nDefense Secretary James Mattis made the decision to disinvite China in consultation with the White House, a U.S. defense official told CNN. The official said the U.S. has imagery showing China deployed anti-ship missiles, surface-to-air missiles and jammers in the South China Sea area. The U.S. called on China to remove these systems, AP reported.\nChinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi called the U.S. decision unhelpful. Wang compared Chinas military presence on South China Sea islands to the U.S. in Hawaii and Guam, saying it was out of necessary defense purposes and has nothing to do with militarization.\nChina has claimed it has sovereignty over islands in the South China Sea, which are also claimed by other countries. Last week, Chinese state media said China had been able to land and take off bomber airplanes, including its H-6K, which is capable of carrying supersonic cruise missiles, on a South China Sea island.\nChina participated in the 2014 and 2016 RimPac maritime exercises. The exercises, in the Pacific Ocean and near the Hawaiian islands, are designed to help participants foster and sustain the cooperative relationships critical to ensuring the safety of sea lanes and security on the worlds oceans, according to the U.S. military.\nIn 2016, 45 ships, 200 aircraft and more than 25,000 people from 26 nations participated in the maneuvers, a defense official told CNN.

      "Content": "The U.S. and China have implemented a previously announced 25 percent tariff on $16 billion worth of goods from each country on Thursday. The tariffs, which were originally announced on Aug. 7, had been scheduled to automatically go into effect at midnight Eastern time in the U.S. and at 12:01 p.m. in Beijing.\nThe U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods apply to 279 product categories, including semiconductors, plastics, chemicals and railway equipment, according to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR). Chinas tariffs on U.S. goods include 333 U.S. product categories, such as coal, copper scrap, fuel, steel products, buses and medical equipment.\nIn response to the $16 billion in tariffs, China has filed a complaint with the World Trade Organisation (WTO) against the U.S., claiming it violated trade rules.\nRepresentatives from China met with U.S. officials in Washington this week for negotiations on trade tariffs; any possible outcome or resolution from the talks has not yet been made public.\nChinas foreign ministry spokesperson, Lu Kang, said of the talks, We hope the U.S. side will get along with us to strive for a good result from the talks with a reasonable and practical attitude. \nPresident Donald Trump told Reuters on Monday that he did not anticipate much from this weeks tariff talks with China.\nReuters cited an anonymous executive at a major U.S. manufacturer in China who suggested that uncertainty about the potential duration of trade negotiations had a greater impact on business than the actual tariffs because it made business planning difficult. It is too early for the tariffs to have a noticeable economic impact, Reuters reported.\nUS and Chinas trading relationship\nThe U.S. and China have the largest trading relationship of any two countries in the world. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the two countries exchanged about $635 billion worth of goods in 2017. That year, the U.S. had a goods trade deficit of $375 billion with China, meaning that the value of goods the U.S. purchased from China was that much higher than the value of the goods China bought from the U.S. \n\nOf all the goods the U.S. imp orts, 18 percent come from China, and of all the goods the U.S. exports, 8 percent are bought by China, according to U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis 2016 statistics.\nAn investigation by the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) concluded that the acts, policies, and practices of the Government of China related to technology transfer, intellectual property, and innovation covered in the investigation are unreasonable or discriminatory and burden or restrict U.S. commerce. Section 301 of the U.S. Trade Act of 1974 allows the president to take action against unfair or discriminatory trade practices, or trade agreement violations. The Trump administration has used the USTRs findings to justify imposing tariffs on China. \nRecent tariff changes\nOn July 6, the Trump administration implemented 25 percent tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese imports. According to The Associated Press, China responded with retaliatory tariffs on a similar value of goods.\nIn addition to the $16 billion in tariffs enacted Thursday, the U.S. compiled a list of $200 billion worth of products that could be tariffed as a potential retaliatory measure against China if it decides to impose additional tariffs against the U.S.\nAs an act of reciprocity, China responded to the U.S. list of $200 billion in goods by announcing its own list of goods on which it may impose tariffs if the U.S. implements its additional tariffs. So far, neither nation has imposed those additional tariffs.\n\nSources: AP, Census Bureau, Reuters, USTR Aug. release, USTR report",

      "Content": "On Thursday, the White House announced key reform proposals for the federal government after a year of planning how to make the government more efficient, effective, and accountable. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) developed the proposals after receiving input from stakeholders, agencies and the public. Specific proposals include consolidating food safety functions into a single agency, merging the Departments of Education and Labor and creating a new Bureau of Economic Growth.\nReorganization will help agencies maintain efficiency and effectiveness over time, according to a White House statement. It also said, Todays Federal Government lacks the organization and technology to provide the convenient and efficient services that Americans have come to expect in the 21st century. It provided what it said were examples of this, including: job seekers having to navigate 40 workforce development programs across 15 agencies, chickens and eggs being regulated by different agencies, and small businesses having overlapping certification processes when they attempt to work with the federal government.\nDigitization is also a must, according to the statement, which says the government creates millions of new paper documents each year.\nThe statement said merging the Departments of Education and Labor into a single Cabinet agency was to better meet the needs of American workers and students. It said economic assistance resources would be consolidated into a new Bureau of Economic Growth within the Department of Commerce to increase economic growth nationwide.\nUnder the plan, the Department of Health and Human Services would be renamed the Department of Health and Public Welfare to better capture the nature of its programs. SNAP, the governments food stamp program, would be moved to the renamed department from the Department of Agriculture. A Council on Public Assistance would be created in the renamed department to oversee food stamps and Medicaid, and would have the power to implement uniform work requirements across those programs.\nAlso under the plan, the government would reform the U.S. Postal Service to restore a sustainable business model to possibly prepare it for future conversion from a Government agency into a privately-held corporation.\nDirector of the OMB Mick Mulvaney said, This effort, along with the recent executive orders on federal unions, are the biggest pieces so far of our plan to drain the swamp. He added, The federal government is bloated, opaque, bureaucratic, and inefficient.\nSome of the reorganization proposals require congressional approval before they can be implemented. \nSen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), the top Democrat on the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, said the plan proposed futile reorganizations of the federal government just to have a new talking point. She also said Democrats and Republicans in Congress have rejected Trumps proposals to drastically gut investments in education, health care, and workers. He should expect the same result for this latest attempt to make government work worse for the people it serves, she added.\nSome of the proposals, such as moving the Office of Personnel Managements policy function into the Executive Office of the President, could be done without lawmaker approval, according to OMB Deputy Director Margaret Weichert. \nThe plan, titled Delivering Government Solutions in the 21st Century: Reform Plan and Reorganization Recommendations, is 132 pages long.\nSources: The Hill, The Washington Post, The White House 1, The White House 2",

      "Content": "A suicide bomber killed at least 31 people and injured more than 40 others near a polling station in the Pakistani city of Quetta on Wednesday after polls opened for the countrys parliamentary elections. The bomber used a motorcycle and may have targeted a police convoy, Al Jazeera reported. The Islamic State (IS) group claimed responsibility for the attack through its affiliated-news site, Amaq. \nAt least 203 people have been killed in violence leading up to the election, Al Jazeera reported. On July 13, for instance, at least 130 people were killed in two separate attacks at political rallies in Pakistan. \nAbout 400,000 troops were deployed at polling stations, approximately one-fifth of the number deployed in 2013, according to The Guardian. The country also deployed police officers in addition to military troops, and together they totaled about 800,000 across 85,000 polling stations, Al Jazeera reported.\nPreliminary election results\nPolls closed at 6 p.m. local time. With approximately 10 to 15 percent of votes counted, local TV channels were projecting the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party to win between 94 and 102 seats in the national assembly, according to Al Jazeera. The national assembly has a total of 342 seats, with 272 directly elected. A majority coalition selects the next prime minister.\nAt 12:19 a.m. local time Thursday, leader of Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) party, Shehbaz Sharif, tweeted that his party wholly rejects the results of General Elections 2018 due to manifest  unacceptable!\nThere are 30 active political parties participating in the elections for both national and provincial assemblies.\nElections and political parties\nThe PML-N has been in power since 2013 and its chairman is Shehbaz Sharif, brother of former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. While campaigning, Shehbaz Sharif said his party had helped Pakistan while in power, for example, by fixing power shortages in the country that had previously resulted in intermittent day-long blackouts. \nFormer international cricket player Imran Khan formed the PTI party and has called former Prime Minister Sharif an agent of India, according to The Guardian. He has also spoken in support of Pakistans blasphemy laws, which mandate the death penalty in certain cases of blasphemy against the Prophet Muhammad. Pakistans population is more than 96 percent Muslim, according to the countrys statistics bureau. \nBilawal Bhutto Zardari, 29, leads the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), which The Guardian describes as historically liberal.\nThe PML-N, which said it wholly rejects the preliminary election results, said the military, in its deployment to polling stations, may have interfered in the election in favor of the PTI party. PML-N alleged that the military interfered because former PML-N Prime Minister Sharif had attempted to reduce the militarys power before he was removed from office by the supreme court last July. The court ruled he had failed to report income from a company his son owned, which Sharif denied.\nCampaigning was suspended as of midnight Monday, in accordance with Pakistani law. Shehbaz Sharif and Khan campaigned in Punjab province that day. Voters in that province will determine 141 of the 272 contested national assembly seats.\nAbout 106 million Pakistanis were registered to vote in the country, 59 million (56 percent) of whom are male. More than 12,570 candidates were running, 3,765 of whom were running for the national assembly, according to Al Jazeera. Voter turnout in the 2013 elections was 55 percent. The minimum voting age is 18.\nIn addition to the 272 contested national assembly seats, 60 of the 342 total seats are reserved for women and 10 for non-Muslims. Those seats will be decided by proportional representation, chosen from political parties' lists of candidates on the basis of total number of general seats secured by each political party, according to the countrys constitution. Voting for the other seats of the national assembly follows a first-past-the-post system in which the winner of the most votes in a district with one assembly seat wins the seat, even if that candidate did not win a majority of the votes, according to the Library of Congress. \nSources: Al Jazeera 1, Al Jazeera 2, BBC, Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, The Guardian, The Library of Congress",

      "Content": "On Friday at 12:01 a.m. EDT, 25 percent tariffs on $34 billion-worth of Chinese imports into the U.S. are set to go into effect. The tariffs are on 818 different categories of items, including industrial machinery, medical devices and automobile parts. China has said that after the U.S. imposes the tariffs, it would impose tariffs on $34 billion-worth of U.S. imports covering 545 categories of items, which could include meat, seafood and corn.\nU.S. tariffs on another $16 billion-worth of Chinese imports, on 284 categories of products, would undergo further review in a public notice and comment process, including a public hearing before they are applied, according to a June U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) statement. On Thursday, President Donald Trump said the tariffs on the additional $16 billion-worth of Chinese imports are planned to be put into effect in two weeks.\nOn Thursday, Chinese Commerce Ministry spokesman Gao Feng said of the impending U.S. tariffs, \"The United States will be opening fire on the whole world and also opening fire on itself. Gao said China \"will never fire the first shot but will be forced to strike back. He said the U.S. tariffs would negatively affect foreign companies that export goods from China to the U.S. \nForeign companies, including U.S.-based ones, accounted for 59 percent ($20 billion) of the $34 billion-worth of goods on which tariffs are to be imposed on Friday, according to Gao. \nWith regards to China taking trade actions against U.S. companies operating in its country, Gao said his government would protect the legitimate interests of all foreign businesses in China. Chinese President Xi Jinping has met with and informed multinational executives in the past three weeks that China would increase the number of sectors in which foreign businesses can invest, the South China Morning Post reported, citing a government official.\nU.S. tariffs are being implemented under section 301 of the U.S. Trade Act of 1974, which allows the president to take action against unfair or discriminatory trade practices, or trade agreement violations. A USTR section 301 investigation concluded that the acts, policies, and practices of the Government of China related to technology transfer, intellectual property, and innovation covered in the investigation are unreasonable or discriminatory and burden or restrict U.S. commerce.\nOn Thursday, Trump said the U.S. could ultimately impose tariffs on more than $500 billion of Chinese goods, with potential future rounds of tariffs on $200 billion of goods and then on $300 billion of goods. The U.S. total imports of goods from China in 2017 was $505.5 billion, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Total U.S. exports of goods to China was $129.9 billion, making the 2017 U.S. deficit in goods trade with China $375.6 billion.\nOther forms of trade restrictions besides tariffs include quotas, increased product inspections and quarantines, and increased effort enforcing trade regulations.\nAlso on Thursday, the U.S. Federal Reserve said most Fed officials who participated in its June meeting noted that uncertainty and risks associated with trade policy had intensified and were concerned that such uncertainty and risks eventually could have negative effects on business sentiment and investment spending.\nUpdate: On Friday, the U.S. tariffs on $34 billion-worth of Chinese imports went into effect. In response, China imposed tariffs on $34 billion-worth of U.S. imports.\n\nSources: CNN, Reuters, South China Morning Post, The Daily Caller, The Washington Post, U.S. Census Bureau",

      "Content": "The U.S. Department of Defense announced a new nuclear arms policy on Friday. The policy change is the first since 2010 and is the result of a Nuclear Posture Review requested by President Donald Trump last January. \nThe previous policy called for a reduction in nuclear arms as part of U.S. commitments under a non-proliferation agreement. The new policy aims to modernize the U.S. nuclear weapons arsenal and make it more flexible to address a changed array of threats, according to a White House statement. The statement said the new policy is needed because other nations have continued to develop their nuclear capabilities while the U.S. has reduced its arsenal. \nThe policy introduces two new types of weapons: so-called low-yield weapons mounted on submarine-launched ballistic missiles and a nuclear submarine-launched cruise missile, or SLCM. Undersecretary of Defense for Policy John C. Rood said the plan would not increase the overall amount of stockpiled nuclear warheads. \nThe SLCM has been in the U.S. arsenal before, but was removed under former President Barack Obama. The low-yield nuclear weapons, if detonated, could have destructive impact similar to the 1945 Hiroshima bomb, according to Financial Times and The Washington Post.\nDefense Secretary Jim Mattis said the goal for the new policy is to convince adversaries they have nothing to gain and everything to lose from the use of nuclear weapons. The new policy document states that the U.S. would only consider a nuclear attack under extreme circumstances. These circumstances could include significant non-nuclear strategic attacks. FT reported that these might include large-scale terrorist incidents like the September 11 attack.\nIn order to carry out the changes, the plan seeks to double the percentage of the Pentagons annual budget allocated to its nuclear program, bringing it up to 6.4 percent. Congress would need to approve this change. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated the plan would cost around $1.2 trillion over the next 30 years.\nThe Nuclear Poster Review can be found here.\nSources: Financial Times, The Washington Post",

      "Content": "The U.S. Supreme Court ruled 5-4 on Tuesday that President Donald Trumps ban on travel from certain countries is squarely within the scope of presidential authority under federal law. The travel ban, in its current version, is a presidential proclamation that places temporary entry restrictions on nationals from seven countries, five of which are predominantly Muslim. The court ruled that lower courts should now consider the travel ban cases before them based on the Supreme Courts interpretation of executive authority.\nThe travel restrictions\nThe first travel ban executive order issued by Trump, last January, barred entry for 90 days of people from seven countries with predominantly Muslim populations: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. Some states challenged the order in court and Trump rescinded it and issued a second order last March. That order had exceptions for travel from Iraq, and stated that the entry restrictions did not apply to those who already had valid visas. \nThe Supreme Court unanimously ruled last June to allow enforcement of a limited version of the March executive order, after federal courts had stayed the order. The Supreme Court ruled it could be enforced on people with no \"bona fide\" tie to the U.S., such as having family in the U.S, or attending school.\nWhen the 90 day period from that order expired in September of last year, the president issued Presidential Proclamation No. 9645. The proclamation restricted and limited entry of nationals from eight countries: Chad, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, Syria, Venezuela and Yemen. The administration removed Chad from this list in April of this year, saying the country had raised its security standards to meet important baseline U.S. national security requirements. The Supreme Court ruled last December to allow the proclamations entry restrictions to take effect while legal challenges continued, after a federal judge in Hawaii had previously ruled to block them.\nRuling in favor of the Trump administration\nTuesdays ruling was supported by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Anthony Kennedy, Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch. Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan dissented. \nIn the majority opinion, Roberts wrote, The sole prerequisite set forth in [federal law] is that the president find that the entry of the covered aliens would be detrimental to the interests of the United States. The president has undoubtedly fulfilled that requirement here.\nRegarding his first executive order travel ban, Trump said last January, \"This is not about religionthis is about terror and keeping our country safe.\nRoberts wrote that the proclamation is expressly premised on legitimate purposes: preventing entry of nationals who cannot be adequately vetted and inducing other nations to improve their practices.\nRoberts cited The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, which reads: \"Whenever the president finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may, by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate.\"\nAfter Tuesdays ruling, Trump tweeted, SUPREME COURT UPHOLDS TRUMP TRAVEL BAN. Wow!\nTrump later said, \"The Supreme Court has upheld the clear authority of the president to defend the national security of the United States. In this era of worldwide terrorism and extremist movements bent on harming innocent civilians, we must properly vet those coming into our country.\"\nQuestion of a religious basis for the ban\nIn a December 2015 press release, Trumps campaign called for entry restrictions, citing hatred by large segments of the Muslim population. The release was titled Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States. \nFive of the seven countries currently covered under Proclamation No. 9645 have Muslim majorities: Iran, Libya, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. In 2010, there were 49 countries with at least 50 percent of the population Muslim, according to the Pew Research Center. \nA lawyer who argued against the travel ban, Neal Katyal, noted in April arguments before the court that Trump had re-tweeted three anti-Muslim videos after his proclamation. The videos had been posted by Britain First, a group that opposes Islam and other political or religious doctrines it considers destructive. Trump later said of Britain First, If you are telling me they're horrible people, horrible, racist people, I would certainly apologize if you'd like me to do that. \nIn a federal court ruling in Hawaii last March that blocked the second executive order on entry restrictions, the judge wrote that a reasonable, objective observer would view the order as issued with a purpose to disfavor a particular religion, in spite of its stated, religiously neutral purpose. The judge cited the December 2015 Trump campaign document about Muslims entering the U.S.\nJustice Sotomayor wrote in her dissenting opinion in Tuesdays Supreme Court case, the repackaging of the ban as not about religion does little to cleanse [the policy] of the appearance of discrimination that the presidents words have created. Based on the evidence in the record, a reasonable observer would conclude that the proclamation was motivated by anti-Muslim animus. \nRoberts noted in his Tuesday majority ruling, \"The text says nothing about religion, and instead was premised on adequate vetting of foreign nationals. \n\"The issue before us is not whether to denounce the statements [made by Trump],\" Roberts wrote. \"It is instead the significance of those statements in reviewing a Presidential directive, neutral on its face, addressing a matter within the core of executive responsibility. In doing so, we must consider not only the statements of a particular President, but also the authority of the Presidency itself.\"\nPresidential Proclamation No. 9645 includes a call for a re-evaluation every 180 days as to whether entry restrictions should continue, be modified, terminated or supplemented.\nSources: CNBC, DHS, Fox News, NBC News, The Daily Caller, The New York Times 1, The New York Times 2, The Washington Post, The White House, U.S. Supreme Court",

Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.), and ranking committee Democrat, Sen.

      "Content": "Members of 20 groups that publicly advocate boycotting Israel have been prohibited from entering into the country, according to a list Israels Ministry of Strategic Affairs published on Sunday. The foreign groups are part of the Palestinian-led BDS movement, which stands for boycott, divest, and sanction, and advocates economic, cultural or academic boycotts of Israel over its settlements in the West Bank. The movement also advocates Israelis comply with international laws pertaining to policies on Palestinians, according to The Washington Post. \nIsrael reportedly introduced the list of prohibited groups after its parliament passed a law in March to deny visas to foreign nationals who publicly advocate boycotting Israel. Until Sunday, the Ministry of Strategic Affairs and the Interior Ministry had declined to publicly disclose the list of organizations. A joint team from both ministries had determined the parameters for barring activists from entry on these grounds. To date, multiple people have been refused entry to Israel for connections to the BDS movement, Haaretz reported. \nIsraeli Strategic Affairs Minister Gilad Erdan said, The state of Israel will actively prevent such groups from spreading their falsehoods and odious methods from within the country. He said the groups would not be allowed to enter and harm Israels citizens. The Interior Minister, Arye Dery, said the barred people were trying to defame Israel.\nSome of the banned organizations responded with public statements. U.S.-based organization Jewish Voice for Peace said on social media the measure was part of an erosion of democratic norms. The CEO for New Israel Fund, also based in the U.S., said the group opposes the governments travel ban and all its actions to punish those with whom it disagrees.\nBanned organizations are primarily from Europe and the U.S. Here is a full list:\nEuropean organizations:\n\n\tThe France Association Palestine Solidarity\n\tBDS France \n\tBDS Italy\n\tThe European Coordination of Committees and Associations for Palestine\n\tFriends of Al-Aqsa\n\tIreland Palestine Solidarity Campaign\n\tThe Palestine Committee of Norway\n\tPalestine Solidarity Association of Sweden\n\tPalestine Solidarity Campaign\n\tWar on Want\n\tBDS Kampagne\n\nU.S. organizations:\n\n\tAmerican Friends Service Committee\n\tAmerican Muslims for Palestine\n\tCode Pink\n\tJewish Voice for Peace\n\tNational Students for Justice in Palestine\n\tUS Campaign for Palestinian Rights\n\nOther groups:\n\n\tBDS Chile\n\tBDS South Africa\n\tBDS National Committee\n\nSources: Haaretz, The Washington Post",

      "Content": "U.S. media ownership history involves various issues, including antitrust laws. Here's a brief overview:\nAccording to Pew Research, the five largest companies in local TV are Sinclair, Nexstar, Gray, Tegna and Tribune. In 2004, those companies owned, operated or serviced 179 stations. That number increased to 378 in 2014 and 443 in 2016, which equals about 37 percent of all full-power local TV stations in the country.\nSinclair has plans to acquire Tribune Media for $3.9 billion. The Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) would need to approve the merger proposal. Last month, a group of federal lawmakers signed a letter criticizing the merger.\nAccording to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), marketplace competition gives consumers the benefits of lower prices, higher quality products and services, more choices, and greater innovation. When one company owns a majority of a market, consumers may not have the ability to choose services based on quality or price, which the FTC claims can negatively affect the economy.\nSince the turn of the 20th century, people have been debating who should have access to what forms of communication. For instance, some of the first efforts to regulate the airwaves occurred after the Titanic sank in 1912. An investigation found that radio interference contributed to delays in rescue operations. In response, Congress passed the Radio Act of 1912, which required all radio operators to be federally licensed. That Act also differentiated between airwaves for public use and those for commercial use. As communications expanded, the U.S. established additional regulations regarding access and ownership. Here are some of the more notable efforts to regulate communications.\n1934: On June 19, the Communications Act establishes the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to, among other things, regulate communications by wire and radio, and make those communications available to all U.S. residents at a reasonable cost without discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, or sex.\n1941: The FCC issues regulations on chain broadcasting. The FCC rules that it will not allow a radio network such as NBC to license more than one broadcast station in a single service area (i.e., the listening or viewing range of a broadcast station). It also prohibits networks from licensing one station in communities that have a limited number of broadcast stations or competition.\n1946: The FCC starts prohibiting national TV broadcast networks from owning another national TV broadcast network.\n1948: On Sept. 30, the FCC announces a freeze on granting new television broadcast licenses after being inundated with license applications. The freeze, which lasted for four years, helped the FCC establish standards for color TV, reserve channels for education and non-commercial purposes, and create a national channel allocation scheme.\n1949: The FCC establishes the Fairness Doctrine, which requires every licensee to give a reasonable portion of broadcast time to the discussion of controversial issues of public importance, and make facilities available for the expression of contrasting viewpoints held by responsible elements with respect to the controversial issues presented.\n1952: The FCC expands the available number of TV channels by allowing grants for UHF (ultra-high frequency) channels 14 through 69. Previously only VHF (very-high frequency) were available: channels 1 through 13.\n1953: The FCC establishes the 7-7-7 rule: one party cannot own more than seven AM, seven FM, and seven TV stations nationwide. At least two of the TV stations had to be UHF. The rule also says one owner cannot have stations in each medium reaching more than 25 percent of the national audience.\n1964: The TV Duopoly Rule is enacted, prohibiting any entity from owning two or more TV stations in the same market.\n1970: The radio/TV cross-ownership rule prohibits a broadcaster from owning a radio station and a television station in the same market.\n1975: The newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership rule prohibits the ownership of both a newspaper and a television station in the same market.\n1985: The FCC expands the 7-7-7 rule to 12 AM, 12 FM and 12 TV stations nationwide. The FCC allows for a discount for the licensing of UHF stations to encourage their use and offset the issues that come with UHF stations: weaker signals and higher operational costs than VHF stations.\n1987: The FCC abolishes the fairness doctrine, after finding it may have violated broadcasters free speech rights.\n1992: The 12-12-12 rule expands to 18 AM, 18 FM and 12 TV stations. The FCC also enacts the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act, which increases the national audience range available for a station owner from 25 to 30 percent. An owner cannot have stations in each medium reaching more than 30 percent of the national audience.\n1994: Ownership rules expand again. One party can own 20 AM, 20 FM and 12 TV stations.\n1996: President Clinton signs the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which eliminates the 12 TV station rule, increasing the number of television stations one entity could control to 35 percent of national cable ownership. It also eliminates the national cap on radio ownership.\n1999: On Aug. 5, the FCC announces changes to the TV Duopoly rule. The changes allow for duopolies if the broadcaster: buys a poor-performing station that has no other buyers, the purchase results in the construction of a previously unbuilt station, or if only one of the two stations is among the top four-ranked stations in the market and there are at least eight full-power independent stations within the market after the merger.\n2003: The FCC revises several rules regarding media ownership. For example, the revisions eliminate restrictions against cross-ownership in markets with more than nine television stations. And cross-ownership among television, radio and newspapers is not permitted in markets with three or fewer television stations. However, a court ruling halts the changes from being implemented. Later that year, Senate Republicans and the White House increase the TV station ownership cap to 39 percent of the national audience.\n2009: Congress sets a June deadline for full-power television stations to stop broadcasting analog signals and convert to digital.\n2016: The FCC announces the rescinding of the UHF discount, citing changes in technology. The FCC says that now that all stations are digital, UHF channels are no longer inferior to VHF channels.\n2017: The FCC eliminates the newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership rule; the radio/television cross-ownership rule; and the requirement that at least eight full-power independent stations remain in the market after the merger of two television stations in a market. The FCC also reinstates the UHF discount until the Commission can address its national television ownership rule more holistically.",

The meeting, which lasted approximately two hours and 40 minutes, covered topics including North Korea, Russian interference, cyberattacks, terrorism, economics and energy.\nThe intelligence communitys Statement for the Record can be read here, and a video of the full hearing can be watched here.\nRussia\nThe intelligence directors were asked to confirm if they supported the conclusions of a Jan. 2017 report that concluded with high confidence that Russia had attempted to influence the 2016 election. All restated their support.\nCoats said, \"There should be no doubt that Russia perceived its past efforts as successful and views the 2018 U.S. midterm elections as a potential target for Russian midterm operations.\" His assessment was supported by the other intelligence leaders at the hearing.\nNorth Korea\nPompeo spoke about an analysis his agency completed on what it would take to hold talks with North Korea and how it would react to a possible U.S. military attack. The results of the analysis are classified and were not discussed in the open session.\nNational debt\nCoats said the U.S. national debt of more than $20 trillion is unsustainable, and poses a risk to our economic and national security.\nThe Rob Porter case\nFBI Director Christopher Wray was asked for information about the allegations of domestic abuse against former White House Staff Secretary Rob Porter, and when this information was made available to the White House.

      "Content": "The European Union Parliament voted on Wednesday to initiate a review of whether Hungary had violated EU law through a number of actions, including allegedly limiting the media and denying refugees equal rights. The EU Parliament will also review whether any alleged actions by the member state warrants penalties or sanctions. Hungary denied the allegations.\nThe EU Parliament alleged that Hungary violated its Charter of Fundamental Rights, which include respect for democracy, equality, the rule of law and human rights. The EU outlines the review process in Article 7 of its charter. \nIn its announcement, the EU Parliament listed several concerns it had with the Hungarian government, including: the functions of its constitutional and electoral systems; whether its judiciary remains independent; corruption and conflicts of interest; privacy and data protection; freedom of expression, religion, and association; academic freedom; the right to equal treatment; minority rights; the rights of migrants, asylum seekers and refugees; and economic and social rights.\nHungarian President Jnos der signed a law on June 28 that made it illegal for human rights workers and community volunteers to provide certain services to migrants and asylum seekers. The punishment includes a jail sentence of up to one year. \nAccording to Reporters Without Borders, business associates of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbn have bought several media outlets with the intention of creating a so-called pro-government media bubble meant to promote the governments positions on topics such as immigration.\nAccording to the EU Parliament, this is the first time that it has called on EU members to potentially penalize a member state to prevent a systemic threat to the unions founding values.\nOrbn said the EUs decision was a response to Hungarys refusal to take in the number of refugees required by an EU-wide resettlement quota plan. Hungary has refused to take in refugees since the EU enacted temporary intake quotas in 2015.\nHungarian Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade Pter Szijjrt said, The decision of the European Parliament on the adoption of the [report on Hungarys alleged EU violations] is the petty revenge of the pro-immigration politicians. Szijjrt said Hungary would be reviewing the available opportunities for legal redress.\nThe EU Parliament voted 448 to 197, with 48 abstentions, to initiate Article 7 procedures against Hungary. To initiate Article 7, an absolute majority of members (376) must participate in the vote and two thirds of the votes cast, excluding the abstentions, must vote in favor of proceeding. \nThe process to initiate Article 7 began when EU Parliament member Judith Sargentini from the Netherlands issued a report listing Hungarys alleged violations, based on information provided by independent bodies such as Amnesty International, the Civil Liberties Union for Europe, and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.\nIn the week that we debate the state of the Union, the European Parliament sends out an important message: We stand up for the rights of all Europeans, including Hungarian citizens and we defend our European values, Sargentini said of Wednesdays vote.\nNow it is up to the European leaders to take their responsibility and stop watching from the sidelines as the rule of law is destroyed in Hungary. This is unacceptable for a Union that is built on democracy, the rule of law and fundamental rights.\nThe EUs 28 individual member states will now vote on whether to approve the EU Parliaments proposal to initiate Article 7. If approved by a four-fifths majority, the European Council may impose sanctions on Hungary or temporarily remove its EU voting rights.\n\nSources: Deutsche Welle, Deutsche Welle, EU Parliament release, Human Rights Watch, Hungary MOFA, Reporters Without Borders, Sargentini report",

      "Content": "On Wednesday, the U.S. Justice Department announced that Wells Fargo had agreed to pay a $2.09 billion fine for allegedly issuing mortgage loans to people whom it knew had incorrect income information on their loan applications. The Justice Department said, Investors, including federally insured financial institutions, suffered billions of dollars in losses from investing in residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) containing loans originated by Wells Fargo. The company did not admit liability as part of the settlement. \nThe Justice Department issued the fine under the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA). \nThe government said that in 2005 Wells Fargo began an initiative to double its production of subprime and Alt-A loans. Subprime loans are made to borrowers who do not qualify for prime interest rates due to conditions such as low credit scores, bankruptcies and past payment delinquencies, according to the Federal Reserve. Alt-A loans or near-prime loans are given to borrowers with good credit records who do not meet standard guidelines for documentation requirements, debt-to-income ratios, or loan-to-value ratios. \nThe government alleged as part of the initiative to increase such loans, Wells Fargo loosened its requirements for originating stated income loans  loans where a borrower simply states his or her income without providing any supporting income documentation. \nThe government said Wells Fargo checked some loan recipients incomes against Internal Revenue Service (IRS) tax transcripts and found that more than 70 percent of the loans it sampled in this way had a greater than 20 percent discrepancy between the borrowers stated income and the income on the borrowers most recent tax returns. The average discrepancy was 65 percent. Wells Fargo then attempted to determine if plausible explanations existed for the applications with discrepancies of 20 percent or more, and found that nearly half of them did not, according to the government. \nThe Justice Department said these results were widely distributed among Wells Fargo employees. The government alleged that Wells Fargo did not disclose this information, and reported inaccurate debt-to-income ratios to investors for the loans it had issued.\nThe Justice Department also alleged that Wells Fargo took steps to insulate itself from the risks of its stated income loans, by screening out many of these loans from its own loan portfolio held for investment and by limiting its liability to third parties for the accuracy of its stated income loans. \nWells Fargo sold at least 73,539 stated income loans that were included in RMBS between 2005 to 2007, the government alleged. And nearly half of those loans have defaulted, resulting in billions of dollars in losses to investors.\nWells Fargos Response\nIn response to the announcement, Wells Fargo said it remains focused on [its] important role as one of the nation's leading providers of mortgage financing. \nWe are pleased to put behind us these legacy issues regarding claims related to residential mortgage-backed securities activities that occurred more than a decade ago, Wells Fargo CEO Tim Sloan said. The company also said the Justice Department has previously reached settlement agreements with other banks over loan issues. \nThe company said Wednesday that it had already set aside the money needed to pay the fine.\nWells Fargo had previously agreed to pay a $1.2 billion fine in April 2016 for improper mortgage lending practices. At the time, the Justice Department said, Wells Fargo Bank admits that it certified that loans were eligible for [Federal Housing Administration] FHA mortgage insurance when they were not, and that it did not disclose thousands of faulty mortgage loans to [Housing and Urban Development] HUD.\nSources: CNN, Fortune, U.S. Justice Department 1, U.S. Justice Department 2",

Libby had pleaded not guilty to all charges. \nAfter his 2007 conviction, President George W. Bush, who was in office at the time, commuted Libbys sentence, which was originally set for 30 months. After the commutation, Libby paid a $250,000 fine, performed 400 hours of community service, and served two years of probation, according to the White House. Libby was disbarred after his conviction and reinstated in 2016 in a decision by the District of Columbia Court of Appeals. \nPlames identity had been revealed to journalist Robert Novak by Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage, according to Fox News. No one has ever been charged for the leak.\nThe White House said Libby had served more than a decade of honorable service before his conviction, that his record is unblemished since, and that he continues to be held in high regard by his colleagues and peers. \nTrump said, Hopefully, this full pardon will help rectify a very sad portion of [Libbys] life.\nSources: White House Statement, CNN, Fox News, NOLO",

      "Content": "On Wednesday, New York City announced a lawsuit against oil companies BP, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, Exxon Mobil and Royal Dutch Shell. The suit, filed Tuesday in the U.S. District Court in Manhattan, says the City seeks to shift the costs of protecting the City from climate change impacts back onto the companies that have done nearly all they could to create this existential threat. The citys Mayor Bill de Blasio and Comptroller Scott Stringer also announced on Wednesday the city has plans to divest $5 billion in fossil fuel investments within five years, from five pension funds valued at $189 billion.\nDe Blasio said the defendants in the suit intentionally misled the public to protect their profits, and that its up to the fossil fuel companies whose greed put us in this position to shoulder the cost of making New York safer and more resilient. The Guardian wrote that the suit will point to evidence that firms such as Exxon knew of the impact of climate change for decades, only to downplay and even deny this in public. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman is reportedly investigating Exxon over this allegation.\nThe lawsuit claims that New York City has had flooding and erosion as a result of climate change. It also claims that two-thirds of greenhouse gas emissions since the industrial revolution have been created by 100 fossil fuel companies, and that the defendants are the largest contributors.\nAn Exxon spokesperson said, reducing greenhouse gas emissions is a global issue and requires global participation and actions, and that lawsuits of this kind  filed by trial attorneys against an industry that provides products we all rely upon to power the economy and enable our domestic life  simply do not do that.\nA spokesperson for Chevron said the lawsuit was factually and legally meritless, and that it only serves special interests. Shell called climate change a complex societal challenge that should be addressed through sound government policy and cultural change, and not in court. Conoco and BP did not comment.\nSan Francisco, Oakland and Santa Cruz in California have filed similar suits against the same five companies. The lawsuits are pending. The Guardian also reported that two California counties are suing 37 fossil fuel companies for their alleged involvement in emitting greenhouse gases. Michael Burger, executive director of Columbia Law Schools Sabin Center for Climate Change Law, said no city has successfully sued a fossil-fuel company for climate change damages. \nRegarding the divestment, Stringer said that safeguarding the retirement of our citys police officers, teachers and firefighters is our top priority, and we believe that their financial future is linked to the sustainability of the planet.The Wall Street Journal reported that trustees of the citys five major pension funds must approve the divestment, and that some funds may implement the proposal and others may not.\nOther cities and organizations  such as Washington D.C., Stanford University and The Rockefeller Brothers Fund  have also sought to divest. Financial Times wrote that pension funds have begun withdrawing from fossil fuel companies over concerns about their impact on climate change and fears that they could lose value if governments enact stricter climate-change rules and regulations.\nThe vice president of the American Petroleum Institute, Kyle Isakower, has said divestment is a tactic of misinformed activists that is incompatible with job creation, affordable energy and economic prosperity. \nSources: The Associated Press, Financial Times, The Guardian, The Wall Street Journal",

Thousands of people protested in more than 20 cities and towns after Polish President Andrzej Duda signed the bill into law Thursday. The ruling party said the reforms are necessary to serve Polish citizens. \nIn the capital city of Warsaw, protesters in front of the presidential palace chanted shame and free courts, and sang the national anthem. Police used pepper spray against protesters in some instances, Reuters reported. Warsaw police spokesman Sylwester Marczak said that someone in the crowd used gas against police officers, and that due to the threat, one of the policemen also used a hand-held gas device.\nThe Law and Justice (PiS) party, which holds a majority in parliament, says Polands judiciary was not reformed properly after the end of communist governance in 1989. PiS leader Jarosaw Kaczyski said, Without [judiciary] reforms, we cannot rebuild the Polish state so that it serves its citizens. \nJudicial reforms\nSince 2015 when PiS won its majority, the party began a series of judicial reforms. Dozens of judges were removed from the countrys Constitutional Tribunal, which examines certain constitutional complaints, and the National Judiciary Council, the body responsible for making judicial appointments, Reuters reported.\nEarlier this month, 22 of the 73 judges on Polands Supreme Court were removed from their positions due to a new law that enforces a retirement age of 64. Supreme Court Chief Justice Malgorzata Gersdorf has refused to leave her job, arguing that her constitutional term runs until 2020. \nLast year, Poland received warnings from the European Commission for its plans to reform its judicial system. The EU said that 13 new laws in Poland over two years have allowed the government to interfere significantly in the judiciary.\nIn December, the Commission invoked disciplinary measures under Article 7 of the EU treaties and has begun a rule-of-law investigation. Polands voting rights in the European Council could possibly be suspended as a result of these measures.\nThe Polish government says EU treaties do not provide the European Commission with authority over national matters such as the judiciary. Let me mention a fundamental issue, said Kaczyski. The court system  is an entirely internal matter.\nExtradition ruling\nOn Wednesday, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) upheld an Irish court ruling that Ireland could refuse to extradite a Polish suspect accused of drug offences under a European arrest warrant, if the Irish judiciary determines the suspect may not receive a fair trial in Poland. Other EU countries potentially may use the ECJ ruling as a basis to reject other Polish arrest and extradition warrants, according to BBC.\nSources: Polish Constitutional Tribunal, BBC, Politico, Reuters",

      "Content": "Scott Morrison became Australias new prime minister on Friday, after a Liberal party leadership contest removed Malcolm Turnbull from the position. Morrison, the partys treasurer, defeated former Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton in a 45 to 40 internal Liberal party coalition vote on Friday. In Australia, the leader of the governing party or coalition also becomes the prime minister, rather than the prime minister being directly elected by voters. \nGovernor-General Peter Cosgrove, the Queens official representative in the Commonwealth country, conducted the ceremony to officially make Morrison Australias 30th prime minister. \nThe new generation of Liberal leadership... is on your side, Morrison said in a speech after the vote. Were on your side because we share beliefs and values in common. He added that the he and the party believe people should keep more of what they own, and that people who have come from so many different parts of the world ten generations ago or ten minutes ago should and will get a fair go in Australia.\nMorrison also said he would bring our party back together which has been bruised and battered this week.\nAfter losing the leadership, Turnbull said it had been such a privilege to be the leader of this great nation. He said he loved Australia and Australians. \nPreviously, Turnbull had described the leadership contests against him as a conservative insurgency that was designed to bring down my prime ministership. Prior to Fridays leadership vote, Dutton had unsuccessfully challenged Turnbull in a leadership challenge on Tuesday in a 48 to 35 party vote. \nTurnbull is the fourth prime minister to be removed from leadership within the past decade. He himself took over from Tony Abbott in 2015 after Abbott led for two years. \nTurnbulls opinion polls have dropped in recent weeks. Newspoll, conducted by news outlet The Australian, showed that dissatisfaction with his leadership increased 18 percentage points from the end of July until mid-August. Last week, Turnbull removed certain carbon emissions reduction requirements from an energy bill, failing to gain the support of his party on the issue. Abbott and other more conservative members of the party argued that the reductions would have economic disadvantages for Australia. \nTurnbull said after the vote he would leave the parliament soon, rather than stay on as a House member. A by-election would need to be scheduled to fill his seat.\nDutton said, after losing the leadership contest to Morrison, that he would give the new prime minister absolute loyalty to make sure we win the election against the opposition party candidate.\nThe Liberal Party coalition currently holds 76 seats in the 150-seat House of Representatives. The main opposition party, the Labor party, holds 69, while smaller parties, which often vote with Labor, hold five seats. The next federal election for the House must be held on or before Nov. 2, 2019. Although the government can choose to hold the election before that date, Morrison told reporters that he did not intend to call early elections. \nBased on an aggregate opinion poll compiled by Poll Bludger (using data from six national polls), if the vote were held this week, the Liberal coalition would receive about 48 percent of the vote, and Labor about 52 percent of it. This would translate to the Liberals winning 59 seats, and Labor winning 87 seats, according to the poll. \nScott Morrison\nMorrison, a 50-year-old married father of two, first entered parliament in 2007. He has held previous cabinet positions, and served as the treasurer since 2015. \nThe new prime minister, colloquially called ScoMo, is often described as a religious conservative and a social conservative. For example, he opposed and ultimately abstained from the vote to legalize same-sex marriage last year. He also supported the countrys Stop the Boats anti-immigration policy. \n\nSources: ABC, ABC, BBC, BBC, BBC, Poll Bludger, Reuters, The Australian",

      "Content": "Turkish media reported Tuesday that Turkish government troops had taken control of 11 areas in northwestern Syria, and created safe zones on the Syrian side of the border with Turkey. The troops have reportedly taken control of four villages, four hills and three rural areas in Afrin province. The action by the troops is part of a campaign to remove the armed Kurdish YPG group from Afrin province, which started on Saturday.\nThe Turkish military said one of its soldiers was killed in the border town of Gulbaba. Fifty-four Syrian fighters and 24 civilians have also been killed, according to the U.K.-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The Turkish government said that there have been no civilian casualties. According to a U.N. report released on Tuesday, around 5,000 people have fled their homes in border communities and moved towards more central parts of Afrin province since the campaign began.\nTurkey considers the YPG a terrorist group with ties to the banned Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK). PKK has fought for autonomy in southeastern Turkey since 1984. The YPG denies any direct links to PKK. The U.S. has previously supported the YPG with arms as part of its fight against the Islamic State (IS) group in Syria.\nU.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has said the campaign and the resulting fighting disrupts what was a relatively stable area of Syria and that it distracts from the international efforts to ensure the defeat of IS. BBC previously reported that Ankara had said the U.S. had to stop backing the YPG if [it] wanted cooperation. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Monday that the U.S. recognized Turkeys legitimate concerns\" for its security, and that the U.S. is willing to work with the country to address said concerns, according to BBC.\nSources: Al Jazeera, BBC 1, BBC 2\n",

      "Content": "North Korean leader Kim Jong Un made an unofficial visit to China from Sunday to Wednesday, according to Chinese state-run news outlet Xinhua. Kim met Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing in his first known visit abroad since taking power when his father, Kim Jong Il, died in 2011. Kim reportedly said, \"It is our consistent stand (sic) to be committed to denuclearization on the peninsula. Kim plans to meet with South Korean President Moon Jae-in in April and U.S. President Donald Trump by May.\nKim also said, \"The issue of denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula can be resolved, if South Korea and the United States respond to our efforts with goodwill, create an atmosphere of peace and stability while taking progressive and synchronous measures for the realization of peace.\" He did not specify the terms or conditions for denuclearization, or the actions his country would take to that end.\nXi told Kim that the two countries \"traditional friendship is the precious wealth of both sides.\" Xi made four proposals regarding relations between the two countries, according to Xinhua. These included: \n1. high-level exchanges, such as visits and sending special envoys and letters to each other;\n2. strategic communications that would strengthen  mutual trust;\n3. actively advanc[ing] peaceful development, and \n4. cement[ing] the popular will foundation for friendship between the countries, including through youth exchanges.\nXi said positive changes had occurred on the Korean Peninsula this year, according to Xinhua. The outlet added that Xi said Chinas goal is denuclearization of the peninsula, safeguarding peace and stability there, and solving problems through dialogue and consultation. According to Xinhua, Xi and Kim talked about the situation of the world in addition to that of the Korean Peninsula. \nXi and Kim held some talks at the Great Hall of the People in Tiananmen Square. Afterwards, they attended a banquet with their wives, Peng Liyuan and Ri Sol-ju.\nNorth Koreas state news agency, KCNA, reported that Kim said, \"It is appropriate that my first trip abroad is in China's capital, and my responsibility to consider continuing North Korea-China relations as valuable as life.\" Kim arrived in Beijing in an armored train.\nChinese diplomat Yang Jiechi will visit Seoul on Thursday to inform South Korea about the content of the visit.\nKCNA said Kim invited Xi to visit North Korea sometime in the future, and Xi accepted the invitation with great pleasure.\nThe Chinese Foreign Ministry released a statement by Kim in which he made the comment about being committed to denuclearization on the peninsula. He said this was in accordance with the will of late President Kim Il Sung and late General Secretary Kim Jong Il. \nIn 2005, while Kim Jong Il was leader, North Korea agreed to stop its nuclear weapons development program during six-party talks in China. North Korea tested its first nuclear weapon in 2006. In 2009, it stopped participating in six-party talks.\nLast year, the U.N. Security Council passed three rounds of sanctions against North Korea in response to its missile and nuclear tests. North Koreas last missile test was in November 2017, and its most recent nuclear weapons test was in September 2017. Last month, North Korea sent a delegation to the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, and agreed to talks with the country.\nUS reaction to the meeting\nEarlier this month, Trump agreed to meet with Kim by May. Trump tweeted on Wednesday: Received message last night from XI JINPING of China that his meeting with KIM JONG UN went very well and that KIM looks forward to his meeting with me. In the meantime, and unfortunately, maximum sanctions and pressure must be maintained at all cost! Trump also tweeted that he was looking forward to his meeting with Kim.\nWhite House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the U.S. was cautiously optimistic, and that it considered Kims first trip outside of his country a positive sign that the maximum pressure campaign is continuing to work.\nSources: AP, NPR, Reuters, The New York Times, Xinhua",

      "Content": "On Wednesday, former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak was released on $250,000 bail after pleading not guilty to three counts of criminal breach of trust and one of abuse of power. Najib, who was arrested Tuesday in Kuala Lumpur, is accused of illegally having about $700 million from the state-owned development fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) transferred to his accounts. He has denied the corruption charges and was cleared of wrongdoing while he was prime minister. \nNajibs party did not secure a majority in the May election this year, and 93-year-old Mahathir Mohamad took over as prime minister. Mahathir had said he would reopen the investigation into Najib, who had been prime minister since 2009. The investigation was reopened after the election.\nNajib set up 1MDB in 2009 with the stated goal of improving the countrys economy through investments. The fund missed payments in 2015 on some of its $11 billion in debt to banks and bondholders. After that, a report in The Wall Street Journal alleged there was evidence the $700 million had been transfered to Najibs personal accounts. \nNajib and 1MDB have been investigated by other countries, including the U.S., which is seeking to recover about $540 million it alleges was misappropriated from the 1MDB fund. The U.S. Justice Department filed a complaint that alleged that officials at 1MDB, their relatives and other associates diverted more than $4.5 billion in 1MDB funds, some through U.S. financial institutions. \nThese cases involve billions of dollars that should have been used to help the people of Malaysia, but instead was used by a small number of individuals to fuel their astonishing greed, said Acting U.S. Attorney Brown. We simply will not allow the United States to be a place where corrupt individuals can expect to hide assets and lavishly spend money that should be used for the benefit of citizens of other nations.\nPolice said last week they had seized at least $225 million worth of jewelry, cash and goods from six properties associated with Najib. Najib and his wife said the seized items were legally acquired, BBC reported.\nOn his way out of the courthouse, Najib said he thought the trial was politically motivated. He also said the trial was my best opportunity to clear my name. A spokesman for the former prime minister said his arrest was the result of political vengeance by Malaysian leadership. The spokesman also said Najib will contest these charges and clear his name in court.\nEach count Najib has been charged with carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison. He is scheduled to appear in court again on Aug. 8. \nSources: BBC, CNN 1, CNN 2",

      "Content": "On Dec. 28, the U.S. and Turkey rescinded restrictions on visas issued to each others citizens, which had been implemented in October.The U.S. had restricted visa services after Turkey arrested a U.S. consulate staff member over suspected involvement in a failed coup to overthrow the Turkish government in July of last year. To understand how Turkey and the U.S. got to this point, heres some background on the attempted coup and what happened after it. \nThe attempted coup\nOn July 15, 2016, members of the Turkish military attempted a coup to overthrow the government of President Recep Tayyip Erdoan. The coup failed within hours. In total, 241 people were killed and 2,194 were injured in the attempted coup. \nOn July 20 of last year, Turkey declared a state of emergency, which is still in place. \nAt the time, then-U.S. President Barack Obama strongly condemned the coup attempt. \nWhat was Turkeys response?\nIn the weeks following the attempted coup, Turkey shut down three news agencies, 16 television channels, 23 radio stations, 45 daily newspapers, 15 magazines and 29 publishing houses. \nSince the coup attempt, Turkish authorities have arrested 40,000 people and fired or suspended 120,000 employees for suspected involvement in the coup. These include military generals and admirals.\nWho does Turkey say was responsible?\nErdoan accused Fetullah Glen of remotely arranging the attempted coup. Glen is a Turkish cleric who lives in self-imposed exile in Pennsylvania. He leads a Muslim movement called the Hizmet movement, which means service. Hizmet has no formal structure or organization. It has an estimated three to six million followers worldwide. \nAfter the coup, Turkey arrested people allegedly associated with Glens movement. Glen denies he was involved in the attempted coup. \nGlen and Erdoan\nIn the past, Glens followers and Erdoans political party, the Justice and Development Party (AKP), have worked together. \nIn 1999, a video of Glen was released in which the cleric told followers to move within the arteries of the system  until you reach all the power centres and wait until they had all the power of the constitutional institution in Turkey. \nHe was then accused of attempting to undermine Turkeys secular state. In 1999, Glen moved to the U.S. Those charges were later dropped in absentia. \nIn 2003, Erdoan became the prime minister, and then the president in 2014. In May 2016, a couple of months before the coup attempt, Turkey declared a group of Glens followers a terrorist organization, and called it the Fetullah Terrorist Organization (FETO). \nHow does the U.S. fit in?\nAfter the coup attempt, Turkey requested that Glen be extradited to Turkey. To date, no U.S. court has ordered Glen extradited. \nIn October of this year, Turkey arrested Metin Topuz, a Turkish employee of the U.S. consulate, for alleged connections to FETO. He was the second employee of a U.S. mission in Turkey to be arrested in 2017. \nThe U.S. responded by suspending nonimmigrant visa services in Turkey. The same day, Turkey suspended visa services in the U.S. Then on Dec. 28, both countries fully reinstated visa services.",

      "Content": "Russias Ministry of Defense spokesperson Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said in a Friday briefing that the alleged April 7 chemical attack in Douma, Syria was staged. He said people in the recordings of the alleged chemical attack were actually patients with smoke poisoning and that their relatives poured water on them after a false claim that chemical weapons were used.\n\nRussias Ambassador to the United Nations Vassily Nebenzia said there was no credible confirmation of toxic substance use in Douma and that what took place was a provocation. Konashenkov also said the Russian military has evidence that Britain had a direct involvement in arranging this provocation. Britains Ambassador to the U.N., Karen Pierce, said the accusations were a blatant lie, adding that the U.K. would never be involved in using a chemical weapon.\nInspectors from the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons are scheduled to arrive in Douma on Saturday to investigate, according to RT. \nThe town of Ghouta was under control of the rebel group Jaish al-Islam, or Army of Islam, from 2012 until Thursday of this week. The group opposes Syrian President Bashar Assad.\nTimeline of alleged events\n\n\tFebruary 2018: Assads forces begin an offensive in eastern Ghouta, where Douma is located.\n\tApril 6: The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a U.K.-based monitoring group, reports that Assads forces conducted airstrikes on Douma.

      "Content": "Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov announced on Thursday that Russia would expel 60 diplomats from the U.S. and 90 diplomats from other countries, in response to those countries expulsion of Russian diplomats earlier this week. \n\nOn Monday, the U.S. announced it would expel 60 Russian diplomats and close the Russian consulate in Seattle in response to Russias alleged use of a nerve agent to poison former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in the English city of Salisbury on March 4. Fourteen EU countries also announced expulsions on Monday. Russia has denied responsibility for the attack.\nThe U.S. diplomats, 58 serving at the Embassy in Moscow and two at the General Consulate in Yekaterinburg, were given until April 5 to leave, RT reported. The Russian Foreign Ministry also announced it would close the U.S. consulate in St. Petersburg by March 31. \nThe U.K. announced on March 14 that it would expel 23 Russian diplomats in response to the poisoning, which was carried out with a Soviet-developed nerve agent, Novichok. U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May said Russia had given no explanation for the presence of Novichok. She said there was no alternative than Russia being culpable for the poisoning  either directly or by losing control of the substance. \nLavrov said the U.K. was forcing everyone to follow an anti-Russian course. He asked for consular access to Yulia Skripal, who was poisoned in the March 4 incident and who is a Russian citizen. Maria Zakharova, a spokeswoman for the Russian Foreign Ministry, said a 1968 consular agreement between the Soviet Union and the U.K. granted Russia the right to meet with its citizens in Britain and offer them advice. \nLavrov also requested a meeting with the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) to establish the truth. OPCW sent investigators to the U.K. on March 19 to test samples. Results are expected after at least two weeks, the British government said.\nAt least 20 countries have announced plans to expel diplomats in response to the poisoning. The Guardian reported that countries have expelled more than 130 Russian diplomats in total, while Russian newspaper RT reported that figure at 150. In addition to the U.S., countries that announced diplomatic expulsions include: Canada, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Sweden, the Netherlands and Ukraine. Russia said its response to each country would be symmetrical.\nAs of Thursday, Sergei Skripal remained in critical condition; Yulia, his daughter, was improving and was no longer in critical condition, according to the Salisbury division of the National Health Service trust. \nInvestigators found Novichok on the front door of Sergei Skripals residence in higher concentrations than other locations they had investigated, according to Britains counter-terror Police Chief Dean Haydon. Maj. Gen. Alexander Mikhailov of the Russian security agency FSB said if the Skripals had been poisoned at Sergeis front door, they would have died before making it to the park where they were found unconscious.\nSources: BBC, RT, The Guardian",

After the announcement, protesters incurred other damages, including blocked roads, looting and vandalism, according to NPR.

The country spends 2.2 percent of its GDP on subsidies, according to a 2014 World Bank report, and the wealthiest 20 percent of Haitians receive 93 percent of the subsidies.\nLafontant became prime minister in 2017.

      "Content": "On Wednesday, the U.N. General Assembly passed a resolution saying it deplores the use of excessive, disproportionate and indiscriminate force by Israel against Palestinian civilians, particularly in the Gaza strip. The resolution passed without mentioning Hamas; a U.S. amendment to the resolution that did not pass had proposed condemning the group, which rules Gaza. The resolution, titled the Protection of the Palestinian civilian population, passed the 193-member assembly with 120 votes for, eight against and 45 abstentions. U.N. General Assembly resolutions are non-binding. \nAustralia, Israel, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Nauru, the Solomon Islands, Togo and the United States voted against the measure.\nThe resolution, put forward by Algeria and Turkey, said the General Assembly was condemning all acts of violence against civilians, including acts of terror, as well as all acts of provocation, incitement and destruction. \nIsraeli forces have reportedly killed at least 120 Palestinians since protests began in Gaza along the border with Israel on March 30. Protesters were calling for the right to return for Palestinians whose ancestors lived in Israel before the May 1948 war between Israel and neighboring countries. Israel has not granted Palestinians the right to return. The country has used live ammunition and tear gas on protesters. Israel said some of those it killed were armed and that it was defending itself from attack. The U.S. has said Israel has a right to defend itself. Other nations have criticized Israel for its use of lethal force.\nThe U.N. General Assembly resolution reaffirmed the right to peaceful assembly and protest, and freedom of expression and of association.\nSome Palestinians have protested peacefully. Others have thrown stones, and flown incendiary kites and balloons with explosives attached to them from Gaza into Israel, where thousands of acres of Israeli farmland and woodlands have been burned as a result, the Jewish Telegraph Agency reported.\nThe resolution requested that U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres report back within 60 days his proposals \"on ways and means for ensuring the safety, protection and well-being of the Palestinian civilian population under Israeli occupation, including ... recommendations regarding an international protection mechanism.\"\nBefore the vote, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said, The U.N.s incessant focus on Israel not only brings shame to the organization. It also draws attention away from so many other pressing issues that demand the attention of the international community.\nAlso before the vote, Palestinian Ambassador and Permanent Observer to the U.N. Riyad Mansour said, \"We need protection of our civilian population. He said the resolution was \"intended to contribute to a de-escalation of the volatile situation.\" He added that Palestinians cannot remain silent in the face of the most violent crimes and human rights violations being systematically perpetrated against our people.\nU.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley said the resolution was totally one-sided. She said it feeds a narrative to the desperate people of Gaza that their leaders are not responsible for their predicament. She added that there are no perfect actors on either side of this conflict. But it does no one any good to pretend that all blame lies on one side.\nThe U.S. amendment that did not pass would have condemned Hamas for repeatedly firing rockets into Israel and for inciting violence along the boundary fence, thereby putting civilians at risk. Hamas is a political organization with an armed division that rules the Gaza territories. Israel and the U.S. have described it as a terrorist organization. Haley said the amendment was a small step in the direction of balance.\nA U.N. Security Council resolution with similar wording as the one that passed the General Assembly was vetoed by the U.S. on June 1. To pass, U.N. Security Council resolutions require at least nine votes out of the 15 members, and no vetoes from the permanent members: Britain, China, France, Russia and the U.S.\nSources: Al Jazeera, Jewish Telegraph Agency, The Times of Israel 1, The Times of Israel 2, UN General Assembly 1, UN General Assembly 2",

      "Content": "On Wednesday, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled unanimously to reverse and remand a case that would broaden corporate whistleblower protections. The case, Digital Realty v. Somers, argued that whistleblowers should be protected against retaliation (such as dismissal or demotion) from employers whose misconduct they seek to expose in cases in which they have not report alleged violations to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\nIn thedecision, Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote that the anti-retaliation protections for whistleblowers in the 2010Dodd-Frank bill only apply to those who have reported alleged wrongdoings to the SEC. Quoting a Senate report, she said the purpose of the anti-retaliation provisions was to motivate people who know of securities law violations to tell the SEC.\nThe lawsuit was filed by Paul Somers, a former employee of Digital Realty, who was fired after he filed an internal complaint against his supervisor, alleging violations of federal securities laws. Last year, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in favor of Somers, who argued that whistleblowers should be protected even if they do not report to the SEC. Digital Realty appealed that ruling.\nThe SEC received over 4,200 reports of alleged misconduct in 2016, according to Bloomberg.\nNote: This article was corrected to state that the Supreme Court voted to reverse and remand. A previous version of the article stated the court declined to hear the case.\nSources:Bloomberg,Reuters",

The largest of the U.S. rallies, Power to the Polls, took place in Las Vegas, initiating a national campaign to increase voter registration. University of Nevada-Las Vegas police estimated attendance at around 8,000, azcentral.com reported.\nSome legislators spoke at Saturdays demonstration in Washington. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) spoke about women who marched last year, and now they have run for office, and some of them have already won their office. She added, We want women to know their power  by showing up not only on the day of the march, but  in town halls.\nAccording to NPR correspondent Leila Fadel, One of the big criticisms of last years march in Washington was that protesters were mostly white, liberal women. She said this year, organizers were trying to access a cross section of America, from minorities to the disenfranchised to women in low-income communities.\"\nTrump tweeted on Saturday, \"Beautiful weather all over our great country, a perfect day for all Women to March. Get out there now to celebrate the historic milestones and unprecedented economic success and wealth creation that has taken place over the last 12 months. Lowest female unemployment in 18 years!\" The unemployment rate for women over the age of 20 has decreased since 2012, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data.\nOn Friday, Trump spoke in Washington at the March for Life, an anti-abortion demonstration. He told protesters, We are with you all the way.\nSources: AP, NPR, The New York Times, Vox",

The White House denies the allegations that an affair took place between Clifford and Trump.\nThe Washington Post reported late Monday night that, according to three people familiar with the case, Cohen was being investigated for possible bank fraud, wire fraud and campaign finance violations. \nSpokespeople for the special counsel and for the U.S. Attorneys Office in New York declined to comment, according to Fox News. \nSources: Associated Press, CNN, Fox News, The New York Times, The Washington Post",

Turkey had already withdrawn its ambassadors to Israel and the U.S. on Monday to protest thekilling of at least 60 Palestinian protesters by Israeli forces and theopening of the U.S. embassy in Jerusalem that day. \nIsraeli soldiers also killed at least two Palestinians during Tuesdays protests, Haaretz reported. Israel said 24 of the 60 of the Palestinians who were killed Monday were militants who attempted to breach the Israeli-Gaza border fence.\nPalestinian President Mahmoud Abbas also called on Husam Zomlot, Palestinian envoy to Washington, to return to Ramallah, a city in the West Bank, as a protest over the opening of the U.S. embassy in Jerusalem. Foreign Minister Riad Malki confirmed the move on Tuesday, according to AP.\nThe Palestinianprotests in Gaza began on March 30 and called for the right to return to Israel for Palestinians whose ancestors lived there before the May 1948 war between Israel and neighboring countries. Israel has not granted the right to return.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said Hamas sent Palestinians to attempt to breach the border fence. The Hamas terrorist organization declares its intention to destroy Israel and sends thousands to breach the border fence in order to achieve this goal. We will continue to act with determination to protect our sovereignty and our citizens, Netanyahu said on Monday.\nHamas is a political organization with an armed division that governs the Gaza territories; Israel and the U.S. have described it as a terrorist organization.\nIsrael has used tear gas on some protesters, and live ammunition on some who approached the border fence with Israel. Israel also said on Tuesday it delivered eight trucks worth of medical supplies and aid to Gaza.\nInternational responses\nSouth Africa recalled its ambassador to Israel on Monday, saying it condemned in the strongest terms possible the violent aggression by Israeli forces along the Gaza border. On Tuesday, Belgium and Ireland summoned their Israeli ambassadors to discuss the Gaza deaths. Both countries called for international investigations of the events in Gaza.\nWhite House spokesman Raj Shah said on Monday, The responsibility for these tragic deaths rests squarely with Hamas. Hamas is intentionally and cynically provoking this response. He added, Israel has the right to defend itself.\nThe EUs foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini called for Israeli forces to restrain from violence, as did the U.K. French President Emmanuel Macron said, France is condemning the violence.\nA German foreign ministry spokeswoman said, Israel has the right to defend itself and secure its [border] fence against violent intrusions, but the principle of proportionality applies. The spokeswoman said that meant only using live ammunition when other forms of deterrence had been unsuccessful against specific threats.\nThe U.N. said, those responsible for outrageous human rights violations must be held to account.\nWest Bank protests\nThere were also protests in the West Bank over the opening of the U.S. embassy in Jerusalem on Monday. Part of Jerusalem is located in the West Bank; Israel occupied East Jerusalem in 1967 and annexed it in 1980. The annex is not recognized under international law and Palestinians want East Jerusalem to be the capital of a Palestinian state. Israel wants all of Jerusalem to be its capital.\nU.S. President Donald Trump announced last December that the U.S. would move its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Palestinians held protests after his announcement.\nAbbas said of the U.S. embassy opening, It is a settlement, not an embassy. A U.S. settlement in East Jerusalem.\nTrump said in a recorded message at the embassy opening ceremony that the U.S. remains fully committed to facilitating a lasting peace agreement.\nSources: Al Jazeera, AP, BBC, BBC, Haaretz, Haaretz, Reuters, Reuters, The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Washington Post, The White House",

      "Content": "U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Alex Azar said Thursday that HHS had identified under 3,000 children who had been separated from their immigrant parents after crossing into the country illegally. Azar said the department arrived at the number after a review and comprehensive audit of multiple data sets, and that included in the number were approximately 100 children under the age of five. He said HHS would conduct DNA tests to expedite verification of parent-child relations prior to reuniting them.\nThe Trump administration announced a zero-tolerance policy in April that called for all adults who were found illegally crossing the border to be charged with federal crimes for illegal entry or attempted entry. Under federal law, children cannot be held in adult criminal detention centers, so the policy has resulted in children being separated from parents or guardians.\nA federal judge in California last week issued a preliminary injunction ordering the government to reunite children under 5 years of age with their immigrant parents by July 10, and older children by July 26. \nAzar said the deadlines were extreme and that we will comply even if those deadlines prevent us from conducting a standard or even a truncated vetting process to verify parent-child relations and the safety of homes to which children are to be taken.\nAzar said HHS will be conducting DNA tests on the children using cheek swabs, noting that parent-child relation verification using documents such as birth certificates would take too long to meet the court-ordered deadlines. Cmdr. Jonathan White, the assistant secretary for preparedness and response at HHS, said DNA test results would only be used to match parents with their children. \nAzar said HHS had previously only reunited children with their parents before they were deported, and now the department will be reuniting families in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention centers during their asylum proceedings. To expedite reunifications, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is relocating detained parents to holding centers near shelters where their claimed children are, according to The Washington Post.\nWe want this to be as compassionate a process as it humanly can be, Azar said.\nAlso on Thursday, two members of the House sent a letter to the U.S. attorney general, the DHS secretary and Azar requesting information on every separated immigrant child in U.S. custody. Chairman of the House Subcommittee on Government Operations Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) and Ranking Democrat on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.) sent the request for information, which was outlined in 11 points that included the age, gender, and location of children and their parents.\nAzar said HHS currently has more than 11,800 immigrant minors under its care. More than 80 percent of them are teenagers, the majority male, who were unaccompanied in crossing the border, the Post reported.\nSources: CNN, NBC News, The Washington Post",

Intermountain, a non-profit, did not specify which drugs the new company would manufacture.\nThe New York Times reported that hospitals have experienced shortages of hundreds of drugs over the past decade, including injectable morphine and medical sodium bicarbonate. The Times cited examples of increasing drug prices; for instance, the cost of antibiotic doxycycline hyclate increased from 5.6 cents per pill in 2012 to $3.65 per pill in 2013.\nBesides Intermountain and the VA, the three hospital groups involved are Ascension, Trinity Health and SSM Health. The five groups combined operate more than 450 hospitals across the country, making up about ten percent of U.S. hospitals. \nThe new company may apply for Food and Drug Administration approval to make drugs themselves, or contract production to a third party. Former Sen. Bob Kerrey, who is a pharmacist, and former director for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Dr. Don Berwick, will be on the advisory board of the new company.\nSources: AP, The New York Times, Intermountain Healthcare",

Everyone on board is presumed dead, including 59 passengers and six crew members, according to a spokesperson for the carrier, Aseman Airlines. The cause of the crash is unknown. Irans President Hassan Rouhani has asked the transport minister to carry out an investigation into the crash.\nThe Aseman Airlines ATR-72 twin turboprop plane was on its way from Mehrabad airport in Irans capital city of Tehran to the city of Yasuj, located 485 miles (780 km) to the south. The control tower was last in contact with the plane 14 miles (22.5 km) from the airport where it was due to land, according to Iranian state TV. The channel also reported that the weather in the area was foggy, windy and snowy at the time of the crash. An Aseman Airlines spokesperson confirmed that the airline had been unable to reach the presumed crash site to confirm whether all on board had died.\nAseman Airlines operates mainly domestic routes in Iran, but also runs international routes. The company is banned from flying in the European Union due to safety concerns, the Associated Press reported.\nThe crashed plane was 25 years old, according to Iranian officials. Aseman Airlines posted about the plane on Instagram in October of last year, saying that after being grounded for seven years, it was being repaired, tested and reinstated.\nInternational sanctions relating to Irans nuclear program have prohibited the supply, sale or transfer of airplane parts to Iranian companies since at least 2008. After the 2015 nuclear agreement lifting some of these sanctions, Iran has regained access to the international market for airplanes and parts.\nSources: AP, Reuters",

Elephants are listed as endangered under the U.S. Endangered Species Act, and the governments of Zimbabwe and Zambia governments allow the hunting of them on a limited basis. \nLegal, well-regulated sport hunting as part of a sound management program can benefit the conservation of certain species by providing incentives to local communities to conserve the species and by putting much-needed revenue back into conservation, a FWS spokesperson said in a statement.\nThe Federal Register is scheduled to post a notice of the change in policy this Friday, according to ABC News. The post would contain information about FWS reasons for the change. \nIn October, the FWS removed a ban on lion parts from Zimbabwe and Zambia, saying that lion trophy hunting in those countries met its criteria to possibly enhance the survival of lions in the wild. FWS says it will re-evaluate lion hunting programs in the two countries in mid-2018.\nUPDATE: On Friday, President Donald Trump announcedvia Twitter that the government would uphold the 2014 ban, pending further review. He tweeted: \"Put big game trophy decision on hold until such time as I review all conservation facts. Under study for years. Will update soon with Secretary Zinke.

White House aides said her decision to resign was unrelated to the hearing, in which she said she had occasionally been required to tell white lies as communications director, according to The New York Times. She said she had never lied about anything relating to the Russia investigation. \nHicks did not say what she would be doing after vacating the position.\nSources: CNN, The New York Times",

She is currently the CIAs deputy director and acting director and, when sworn in, she will become the first woman to lead the intelligence agency.\nDuring part of her confirmation hearings, which were open to the public last week, some senators asked Haspel about her time at the CIA after 9/11 when enhanced interrogation techniques were used. In her written responses to senators questions, Haspel wrote that the enhanced interrogation program is not one the CIA should have undertaken and that the U.S. must be an example to the rest of the world.\nAlso during the public hearing, Haspel said, I would not allow [the] CIA to undertake activity that is immoral, even if it is technically legal. I would absolutely not permit it. I believe [the] CIA must undertake activities that are consistent with American values.\nHaspel began working with the agency in 1985.\nSources: CNN, Fox News, The New York Times",

He said, \"We will consider the Taliban's view in the peace talks.\" He mentioned some possible negotiation items for a peace agreement with the Taliban, such as new elections that included the group, release of prisoners and a constitutional review. \nGhani also said the government could provide passports and visa services to Taliban members and consider removing sanctions against its leaders. He called upon the Taliban to declare itself a political group and negotiate a ceasefire. He said, \"We are making this offer without preconditions in order to lead to a peace agreement.\" The U.N. mission in Afghanistan said it \"strongly supports the vision for peace through intra-Afghan dialogue.\"\nGhani also called for talks with Pakistan. Afghanistan has accused Pakistan of aiding the Taliban; Pakistan has denied the claim.\nA Taliban official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Taliban leaders were studying Ghani's proposal. \nMore than 20 countries were present at the conference where Ghani spoke. The first Kabul Process for Peace and Security Cooperation Conference was held in June of last year. \nIn 2001, the U.S. led an invasion of Afghanistan that removed the Taliban from power. A new government was set up in Kabul, the capital. The Taliban was still present in parts of the country. Last year more than 10,000 Afghan civilians were killed or wounded in conflicts between government forces and the Taliban. The group claimed responsibility for an attack in Kabul on Jan. 27 in which an ambulance containing explosives was driven into the city and exploded, killing at least 103 and injuring about 235.\nSources: AP, Reuters",

      "Content": "On Monday, the U.S. Senate voted on the Pain-Capable Unborn Child bill, which seeks to restrict abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy. The bill didnt receive enough votes toprevent a filibuster, meaning it can be voted on again, reworked or tabled.The following information, although not by any means complete, is intended to outline some of the research available on fetal pain.\nThe bill focuses on the argument that theres substantial medical evidence that a fetus is capable of experiencing pain by at least 20 weeks after conception as its reason to ban abortion after this stage. Although there are other considerations in the broader debate on abortion, we will focus here on exploring some of the science behind this specific issue. \nNote: The bills use of unborn child refers to a 20-week old fetus. According to the Merck Manual, the embryo is considered a fetus at the end of the eighth week after conception, or after 10 weeks of pregnancy.\nWhat does the bill say about fetal pain?\nThe bill says theres medical research that shows strong evidence for the conclusion that a functioning cortex is not necessary to experience pain. Some physicians disagree, saying a fetus requires certain neurological development to sense pain, specifically, that it needs the cerebral cortex as well as nerve connections between the thalamus and the cortex. \nThe bill said Congress had two findings: One, that by no later than 20 weeks, pain receptors (nociceptors) exist throughout the fetus body, and that nerves link those receptors to the brains thalamus and subcortical plate. Two, that by 8 weeks after conception, the embryo reacts to touch. The bill added that after 20 weeks, the fetus reacts to stimuli that an adult would recognize as painful, for example, by recoiling.\nWhat is the cerebral cortex?\nThe cerebral cortex is the outer layer of the brain, or cerebrum. The cerebral cortex is divided into four parts or lobes: frontal, parietal, occipital and temporal. At the bottom of the cerebral cortex is the thalamus, which is part of the limbic system (a system of nerves and networks in the brain that relate to instinct and mood). The thalamus relays sensory input to the cerebral cortex.\nWhat data supports fetuses sensing pain?\nAccording to a 2006 article by Dr. Kanwaljeet Anand, fetal pain may not be connected to the cerebral cortex because some adults whove had cortex tissue removed can continue to feel pain. This would support the conclusion cited in the bill that says a functioning cortex isnt necessary to sense pain. \nIn a 2008 paper entitled Developmental Perspectives: Is the Fetus Conscious?, Dr. Roland Brusseau wrote that connections to the thalamus are involved in responses to nociception that are observed in fetuses as early as 18 weeks. He said perhaps the subcortex, which includes the thalamus, is sufficient for minimal consciousness that may render an integrated experience of nociception that we might call pain.\nWhat data supports fetuses not sensing pain?\nFactcheck.org noted that a fetus reaction to touch as possible evidence of pain perception (which the Senate bill mentions) may be reflexive and not necessarily connected to pain. A 2005 study in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) said withdrawal reflexes and hormonal stress responses to invasive procedures dont prove that fetuses sense pain, because those things can be elicited by nonpainful stimuli and occur without conscious cortical processing.\nOther medical organizations say the cerebral cortex is needed to feel pain. In 2010, Britains Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists concluded that a fetus cannot feel pain prior to 24 weeks gestation: the periphery to the cortex are not intact before 24 weeks of gestation and, as most neuroscientists believe that the cortex is necessary for pain perception, it can be concluded that the fetus cannot experience pain in any sense prior to this gestation. It also noted evidence that the fetus doesnt experience a state of true wakefulness in utero due to its chemical environment. It said the fetus in utero is in a continuous sleep-like unconsciousness or sedation. \nA 2013 memo by the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists came to a similar conclusion, saying the connections needed to transmit signals from peripheral sensory nerves to the brain, and the brain structures necessary to process those signals, dont develop until at least 24 weeks of gestation.\nThe 2005 JAMA study found that the conscious perception of pain occurs after thalamocortical pathways begin to function, which it estimated to be around 29 to 30 weeks gestation, based on the limited data available.\nHow frequent are abortions after 20 weeks?\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) tracks abortion data voluntarily provided by states and other reporting areas. Below is the CDCs 2014 abortion data based on the number of weeks of gestation:\n\n\t91.5 percent of abortions were performed by 13 weeks gestation or earlier.\n\t7.2 percent were performed between 14 and 20 weeks' gestation.\n\t1.3 percent were performed at 21 weeks' gestation or later.\n\nWhat do people in the US think of abortion?\nNational Review, which was one of the outlets we analyzed, cited a Marist poll that said, nearly two-thirds of Americans support a 20-week abortion ban. The poll, sponsored by The Knights of Columbus, was based on the aggregate of two surveys: one of 1,267 adults conducted Dec. 4-7, 2017, and another of 1,350 adults conducted Jan. 8-10, 2018. Other U.S. polls provide different results. Below are some examples.\nMarist: More than three quarters of Americans would limit abortion to  at most  the first three months of pregnancy.\nPew: As of 2017, 57 percent of respondents said abortion should be legal in all or most cases, and 40 percent said it should be illegal in all or most cases.\nGallup: As of 2017, 50 percent of respondents said abortion should be legal under certain circumstances, 29 percent said it should be legal under any circumstances, and 18 percent said it should be illegal in all circumstances.\nIpsos: As of 2017, 40 percent of respondents said abortion should be allowed whenever a woman decides she wants one; 28 percent said it should be permitted in certain circumstances, such as rape; 14 percent said abortion shouldnt be allowed under any circumstances, except when the life of the mother is in danger; and eight percent said abortion should never be permitted.",

      "Content": "At least 18 people were killed and 10 injured when a overpass bridge collapsed and fell on at least six cars and a bus in Varanasi, India, on Tuesday evening. Construction of the 164 foot (50 m) long overpass had been partially completed in February, and some work was ongoing, according to Varanasi Commissioner Deepak Agarwal.\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted that he was saddened by the loss of lives and that he had spoken to officials to ask them to ensure all possible support to those affected. Authorities called off rescue operations at 10 p.m. local time Tuesday, according to Sanjay Kumar, the Uttar Pradesh State Disaster Management Authority commissioner.\nPolice have opened an investigation into Uttar Pradesh State Bridge Corporation, the public sector company that was building the overpass. The company will send a technical team to examine the cause of the collapse, the company said. Rajan Mittal, managing director of the company, said, Preliminary findings point towards a loose cross-beam connection or a bearing failure. The beam may have [been] dislodged from its socket because of the thunderstorm and fell. So it may be a natural disaster. \nMittal said that at the time of the collapse, the company had completed 56 percent of the work on the bridge. He also said traffic should not have been allowed under the bridge while construction was ongoing and his company had written several letters to authorities to impose traffic restrictions. The companys requests went unheeded, according to Mittal. \nThe company is constructing 115 bridges and flyovers in the state, many with planned completion dates by the end of the year. Mittal said the company stopped all its construction work until safety norms at each site can be analyzed. He said all the companys employees decided to donate a days pay to aid in the relief effort.\nThe state government is giving $7,600 (500,000 rupees) to families of those who died and $3,000 (200,000 rupees) to those injured in the incident.\nSources: CNN, Hindustan Times 1, Hindustan Times 2",

      "Content": "On Monday, three parents of children killed in the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting filed two defamation lawsuits against Alex Jones, a radio host and owner of the Infowars website. Jones has suggested that parents of Sandy Hook shooting victims were actors, and has said media coverage of some mass shootings was totally staged. After the lawsuits were announced, he said the contexts of the suits were not accurate and that his lawyers were confident they would be dismissed. \nThe lawsuits were filed in Travis County, Texas, where Jones resides and has an Infowars studio.\nNeil Heslin brought one of the lawsuits; his six-year-old son Jesse died in the Sandy Hook attack. Leonard Pozner and Veronique De La Rosa brought another; their six-year-old son Noah died in the attack. Mark Bankston, a Houston lawyer, is representing them. \nBankston is also representing a 24-year-old man in another case in which Infowars allegedly said the man was the perpatrator in the shooting at a high school in Parkland, Florida, that killed 17. A 19-year-old man, Nikolas Cruz, has been charged with the Parkland shooting.\nThe lawsuits by the Sandy Hook parents are seeking $1 million in damages from Jones, Infowars, and affiliated Free Speech Systems LLC. One of the lawsuits said the Infowars statements were a continuation and elaboration of a years-long campaign to falsely attack the honesty of the Sandy Hook parents, casting them as participants in a ghastly conspiracy and cover-up. One of the lawsuits said the defendants defamatory statements were knowingly false or made with reckless disregard for the truth.\nOn Dec. 14, 2012, a single shooter killed 20 children and six adults in Newtown, Connecticut.\nJones broadcasts and the lawsuit claims\nAccording to one of the lawsuits, in September 2014, Infowars published an article with the headline FBI SAYS NO ONE KILLED AT SANDY HOOK. It also says in December 2014, Jones said on his radio show, The whole thing is a giant hoax. How do you deal with a total hoax? It took me about a year, with Sandy Hook, to come to grips with the fact that the whole thing was fake. When asked by NBC News Megyn Kelly in June 2017 about his giant hoax comment, Jones said he sometimes plays devils advocate.\nIn November 2016, Jones aired a segment called Alex Jones Final Statement on Sandy Hook. In April 2017, Jones aired a segment called Sandy Hook Vampires Exposed. \nIn the 2016 video, Jones said, I dont know what really happened. He said the official story of the event has holes in it. He added that he questioned the PR and talking points around the incident. During a broadcast, Jones has said that opponents of the Second Amendment could be involved in the giant hoax of Sandy Hook, according to The New York Times.\nIn a June 2017 news segment about Jones, Heslin told NBC News Megyn Kelly, I lost my son. I buried my son. I held my son with a bullet hole through his head. Owen Shroyer, a reporter at Infowars who is named in one of the lawsuits, said after Heslins interview that Heslin could not have held his son because Sandy Hook parents identified their children after the shooting through photographs. Heslins lawsuit says Shroyers claim is false and that childrens bodies were given to their parents for their funerals.\nPozner and De La Rosas lawsuit refers to Jones talking about an interview that CNNs Anderson Cooper did with De La Rosa after the shooting. In 2014, Jones referred to a moment in which Cooper turns his head and his nose seems to disappear; Jones called it proof that he was talking in front of a screen and wasnt actually at the town square in Newtown, Connecticut, where the Sandy Hook shooting occurred. The Times reported that this was a compression artifact, which is a distortion that is common in video encoding.\nJones response\nIn a broadcast in response to the lawsuit, Jones said, I believe Sandy Hook happened, and later, I believe kids died there. Im sorry for your loss. He talked about a police stand down and that the media response was totally staged in multiple mass shootings. \nJones said more than 10 lawsuits had been filed against him in the last few months by Democratic Party-connected firms. He said his lawyers were very confident these suits were frivolous, that what was put in the contexts of the suits was not accurate and that they would be dismissed. \nRelated cases\nIn June 2017, a judge sentenced Infowars viewer Lucy Richards to five months in prison for leaving messages for Pozner that included telling him, you gonna die, death is coming to you real soon. Richards sentence specified that she was no longer allowed to access Infowars.\nIn March, a Virginia man named Brennan Gilmore sued Jones for saying Gilmore was a deep state shill and a CIA asset. Gilmore recorded and posted online a video of a car that drove into a crowd, killing at least one, in Charlottesville, Virginia, last year during a Unite the Right rally. Jones said none of the InfoWars coverage of Gilmore was knowingly false.\nSee our past coverage of a misleading news story by Infowars here.\nSources: Courthousenews.com 1, Courthousenews.com 2 HuffPost, NBC News, Reuters, The New York Times\n",

In regard to regulation, Zuckerberg said, \"The internet is growing in importance around the world ... I think it is inevitable that there will need to be some regulation.\nWhen Rep.

      "Content": "On Monday, the U.S. Supreme Court voted 5-4 that companies can include arbitration clauses in employment contracts to prevent workers from engaging in collective legal action for wage or workplace disputes. The decision could affect 25 million employment contracts, according to The New York Times and The Washington Post.\nJustice Neil Gorsuch, writing for the majority, said the question being examined was: Should employees and employers be allowed to agree that any disputes between them will be resolved through one-on-one arbitration? Or should employees always be permitted to bring their claims in class or collective actions, no matter what they agreed with their employers?\nAs a matter of law the answer is clear, Gorsuch wrote. In the Federal Arbitration Act, Congress has instructed federal courts to enforce arbitration agreements according to their terms  including terms providing for individualized proceedings, he wrote.\nJustice Ruth Bader Ginsburg authored the dissenting opinion. In reference to Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), she wrote, in addition to protecting employees rights to form, join, or assist labor organizations and to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing, the Act protects employees rights to engage in other concerted activities for the purpose of . . . mutual aid or protection. She said she believed the Section 7 rights include the right to pursue collective litigation regarding [employees] wages and hours, and that the employer-dictated collective-litigation stoppers, i.e., waivers, are unlawful. She read her dissent from the bench. \nGorsuch, along with Chief Justice John Roberts Jr. and Justices Anthony Kennedy, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito Jr., voted in favor of the ruling.\nJustices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan dissented.\nIn a 2011 decision, the Supreme Court ruled that companies could include arbitration clauses in contracts with consumers, as opposed to employees, to prohibit class action suits and instead require the consumers to enter individual arbitrations during disputes. The court voted 5-4 on that case, ATT Mobility v. Concepcion. Such clauses are now often included in contracts for cell phones, credit cards and rental cars, according to The New York Times. \nSources: The New York Times, The Washington Post",

The company said it did not know who was responsible for the inauthentic accounts and would update its post about the situation with more details when we have them, or if the facts we have change. \nWere still in the very early stages of our investigation and dont have all the facts  including who may be behind this, Facebook said. \nFacebook said that about two weeks ago it identified eight pages and 17 profiles on Facebook and seven Instagram accounts that violate our ban on coordinated inauthentic behavior. \nFacebook alleged that some of the pages used VPNs and internet phone services, and paid third parties to run ads on their behalf, to obscure the identity of the creators or administrators. Additionally, one of the pages had an administrator who was associated with the Russia-based Internet Research Agency, which the U.S. indicted for alleged interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Facebook said it removed that page within minutes.\nThis kind of behavior is not allowed on Facebook because we dont want people or organizations creating networks of accounts to mislead others about who they are, or what theyre doing, Facebook said. \nThe social media company said more than 290,000 total accounts had followed at least one of the pages, with the first one created in March 2017 and the last in May 2018. Facebook has more than 2.23 billion active monthly users.\nPages removed\nOne of the removed pages promoted an Aug. 10-12 event called No Unite the Right 2  D.C., a counter-protest to a demonstration planned in Washington by the same group that organized the Charlottesville, Virginia white nationalist protest last August. Nathaniel Gleicher, head of cybersecurity policy at Facebook said the company had taken down the posting on Tuesday and informed 2,600 Facebook users who had indicated interest in attending. \nWe are sharing what we know today given the connection between these bad actors and protests that are planned in Washington next week, Facebook said on Tuesday. \nFacebook also said one post it removed had referred to an event to protest the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency (ICE).\nThe social media company said the most followed Facebook pages it removed were Aztlan Warriors, Black Elevation, Mindful Being, and Resisters. Facebook said the remaining pages had no more than 10 followers each and the Instagram accounts had zero followers. \nFacebook said, We removed all of [the accounts and pages] this [Tuesday] morning once wed completed our initial investigation and shared the information with U.S. law enforcement agencies, Congress, other technology companies, and the Atlantic Councils Digital Forensic Research Lab, a research organization that helps us identify and analyze abuse on Facebook.\nThe company also said the accounts ran about 150 ads for approximately $11,000 on Facebook and Instagram, paid for in U.S. and Canadian dollars. The first ad was created in April 2017, and the last was created in June 2018.\nLink to Russian-associated account\nFacebook said an account associated with the Russia-based Internet Research Agency (IRA) had been an administrator on the Resisters page until Facebook discovered and removed it seven minutes later. \nIn February, U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller indicted the IRA, two other companies and 13 Russian nationals for alleged interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Russian President Vladimir Putin has denied ordering an influence campaign on the U.S. election. U.S. intelligence agencies have assessed with high confidence that Putin ordered such a campaign.\nIn April, Facebook said it had removed 70 Facebook accounts, 138 Facebook pages and 65 Instagram accounts that it said were controlled by the IRA. \nOn Tuesday, Facebook said the connections it found with previously identified IRA accounts were on their own insufficient to support a firm determination [that IRA was behind the activity], as we have also seen examples of authentic political groups interacting with IRA content in the past. \nFacebook also said, some of the tools, techniques and procedures of this actor are consistent with those we saw from the IRA in 2016 and 2017. But we dont believe this evidence is strong enough to provide public attribution to the IRA. The [tools, techniques and procedures] of the IRA have been widely discussed and disseminated, including by Facebook, and its possible that a separate actor could be copying their techniques.\nCongressional Response to Facebooks Announcement\nThe ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, Adam Schiff, said, \"Today's announcement from Facebook demonstrates what we've long feared: that malicious foreign actors bearing the hallmarks of previously-identified Russian influence campaigns continue to abuse and weaponize social media platforms to influence the U.S. electorate.\"\nChairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) said he is glad to see that Facebook is taking a much-needed step toward limiting the use of their platform by foreign influence campaigns. The goal of these operations is to sow discord, distrust, and division in an attempt to undermine public faith in our institutions and our political system.\nFacebook did not say what country the accounts and pages may have originated from. It said, Its clear that whoever set up these accounts went to much greater lengths to obscure their true identities than [the IRA] has in the past.\n\nSources: ABC News, Facebook, Statista, The Washington Post",

      "Content": "An Amtrak train that derailed in Washington state on Monday morning was traveling at 80 mph on a curve with a posted speed limit of 30 mph. Some of the trains coaches fell off an overpass crossing Interstate 5 near Olympia, Washington, damaging five cars and two trucks on the road below. Three passengers on the train were killed, and about 70 people were injured according to The Seattle Times.\nThe Seattle Times reported about 80 passengers and seven crew members were on the train when it derailed. The train was making a first run on a new route that was part of a $181 million rail project between Portland, Oregon, and Seattle, Washington. \nBella Dinh-Zarr of the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said Monday its too early to determine why the train was going 50 mph faster than the speed limit. Amtrak CEO Richard Anderson said that positive train control (PTC) equipment had been installed along the 14.5 mile line, and that it was not yet operational in the area of the derailment. PTC automatically reduces a trains speed when it travels over a certain limit. Congress has mandated that PTC be operational on railroad lines by the end of 2018.\nNTSB expected its investigation into the cause of the crash to last about a week. The U.S. Department of Transportation said Tuesday it would be sending a team of 15 experts from the Federal Rail Administration to aid in the investigation.\nSources: Business Insider, The Seattle Times",

The PMF statement added that its soldiers were conducting security operations around Hawija at the time of the attack, when IS militants ambushed its convoy. IS reportedly used Iraqi army uniforms and a fake checkpoint for the ambush. \nIn a statement, Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi ordered security forces to bring those responsible to justice.\nIS occupied Iraqs second largest city, Mosul, in 2014. Last July, Iraq took control of Mosul, and declared victory over IS in December. Armed conflicts with the militant group reportedly continued in other areas of the country.

      "Content": "A judge in Michigan sentenced former U.S.A. Gymnastics team doctor Larry Nassar to 40 to 175 years in prison on Wednesday for sexual misconduct. The sentence comes after he pleaded guilty to seven counts of first-degree criminal sexual misconduct in Ingham County last November. During a seven-day hearing that started on Jan. 12, more than 160 women and girls said in court that Nassar sexually abused them, The New York Times reported.\nNassar, 54, apologized before the sentencing, saying the words of the women who testified had shaken him to his core. He said, I will carry your words with me for the rest of my days. Before delivering the sentence, Judge Rosemarie Aquilina read a letter Nassar submitted to the court last week in which he said he was manipulated into pleading guilty, his treatments were medical, not sexual, and the media had convinced his accusers that everything I did was wrong and bad. Judge Aquilina said to Nassar, I find that you don't get it, that you're a danger. That you remain a danger.\nNassars accusers include five Olympic gold medal gymnasts: Aly Raisman, McKayla Maroney, Gabby Douglas, Jordyn Wieber and Simone Biles. Among other accusations, Nassar was accused of penetrating some of his patients with ungloved fingers and touching their bare breasts. Some of the accusers were under the age of 18 at the time of the alleged events. \nU.S.A. Gymnastics fired Nassar in 2015 citing athlete concerns. Nassar disputed this claim, saying he left voluntarily. After he was fired, Nassar continued to work as a doctor at Michigan State University. The university received a complaint about Nassar in 2014. The school found no violations of its policies, and allowed him to continue his work there under some restrictions, such as not being allowed to make skin-to-skin contact in certain areas of patients bodies without another person in the room. The school fired Nassar in September 2016 after the Indianapolis Star reported allegations of sexual misconduct against him. \nOn Tuesday, the N.C.A.A. opened an investigation of Michigan State Universitys actions regarding Nassar. The school has asked the state attorney general to investigate as well. Following the sentencing on Wednesday, Michigan state lawmakers passed a nonbinding resolution calling for the universitys president to be removed.\nThe chairman and some of the board of the U.S. gymnastics national governing body, U.S.A. Gymnastics, resigned this week. The U.S. Olympic Committee called for all U.S.A. Gymnastics board members to resign following the announcement of the sentence.\nIn a separate case, Nassar was convicted on child pornography charges and sentenced in December to 60 years in federal prison. He has also pleaded guilty to three counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct in Eaton County; the sentencing hearing will begin on Jan. 31.\nSources: AP, CNN 1, CNN 2, Indianapolis Star, The Los Angeles Times, Michigan State, The New York Times 1, The New York Times 2",

The charges against Manafort do not relate to the election. The judge set July 10 as the trial start date.\nThe prosecutor in the case, Andrew Weissmann, said he expects to call 20 to 25 witnesses at the trial. The judge ordered Manafort to be confined to his home until the trial and wear a GPS tracking bracelet.\nManafort was indicted in Virginia last month. Prosecutors said federal sentencing guidelines, in the case of a guilty verdict, include four to five years for bank fraud, and eight to 10 years for filing false tax returns and failing to report foreign bank accounts.\nLast month, Manafort pleaded not guilty to charges brought by Mueller's investigation in a Washington, D.C., federal court. The charges there included money laundering, conspiracy and making false statements. The judge in that case set a trial date of Sept. 17. \nManafort's business partner Rick Gates, also named in the February indictment, pleaded guilty in Washington, D.C., last month to reduced charges of conspiracy and lying to the FBI. Mueller's prosecutors dropped the case against Gates in Virginia after he signed a plea agreement.\nSources: ABC News, The Washington Post",

      "Content": "A federal judge in Seattle temporarily ordered on Tuesday that blueprints for 3D-printed guns from non-profit company Defense Distributed be removed from online availability. On Monday, eight state attorneys general sued to stop the Texas-based company from being allowed to post the designs online. \n\nIn 2013, the government had blocked the company from posting such blueprints. In June of this year, after a multi-year lawsuit, the company came to an agreement with the U.S. Department of State allowing it to post designs online. The eight state attorneys general who sued argued that 3D-printed plastic firearms are dangerous because they are untraceable, can be undetectable and do not require background checks to produce.\nBefore the Tuesday ruling, Defense Distributed founder Cody Wilson said in an interview with CBS News, I believe that I am championing the Second Amendment in the 21st century.\" He added, I think access to the firearm is a fundamental human dignity. It's a fundamental human right.\nWilson made the worlds first working plastic gun in 2013, CBS News reported. \nIn addition to the lawsuit from eight states, attorneys general from 21 states called on Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Attorney General Jeff Sessions to end the governments agreement with Defense Distributed that allowed the company to post designs online. Sen. Bill Nelson (D-Fla.) announced Tuesday he was introducing legislation to prohibit the online publication of 3D-printed firearm blueprints.\nDefense Distributed blueprints and machines\nAs of last Friday, Defense Distributed had published 10 blueprints online, including for handguns and AR-15-style rifles. The ones for AR-15-style rifles had been downloaded thousands of times by Tuesday.\nThe guns are downloadable, Wilson said. The files are in the public domain. You cannot take them back. You can adjust your politics to this reality. You will not ask me to adjust mine.\nIm talking about files, Wilson added. I'm not talking about the guns. I'm not a licensed gun manufacturer. I don't make guns at this location [where the company is based in Texas]. I have data, I can share the data. \nWilson's company also sells milling machines for $2,000 that are pre-loaded with design files. The machines can be used in creating handguns and AR-15-style rifles in about two days. The company has a three-month backlog of orders for the machines, and Wilson says he screens people who want to buy his companys milling machines. \nA milling machine is different from a 3D-printer in that a milling machine removes material to make a part, such as from a metal or plastic starting piece, while a 3D-printer adds material, such as plastic, to make a part, according to All3DP, a 3D-printing magazine.\nIndustry experts say 3D-printers can be expensive, and 3D-printed guns may not last as long as normally manufactured guns, The Associated Press reported.\nWhat I'm doing is legally protected, Wilson said. I will go to the appellate level. I will go to the Supreme Court. I will waste all my time. He agreed to not publish new 3D-printed firearm blueprints online during the temporary court order, which is in effect until a new hearing is held in September.\nWhite House on the issue\nPrior to the court order, President Donald Trump tweeted on Tuesday morning, I am looking into 3-D Plastic Guns being sold to the public. Already spoke to [the National Rifle Association], doesnt seem to make much sense!\nWhite House Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley said Tuesday, The president is committed to the safety and security of all Americans and considers this his highest responsibility. In the United States, it is currently illegal to own or make a wholly, plastic gun of any kind -- including those made on a 3D printer. Gridley added, The administration supports this nearly two-decade old law. We will continue to look at all options available to us to do what is necessary to protect Americans while also supporting the First and Second amendments.\nOther responses \nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said, Metal detectors and other security measures will be completely useless against the flood of undetectable and untraceable ghost guns that the GOP is inviting into our schools, workplaces, airports and public buildings.\nOn Tuesday, NRA Executive Director Chris Cox said, Regardless of what a person may be able to publish on the Internet, undetectable plastic guns have been illegal for 30 years. Federal law passed in 1988, crafted with the NRA's support, makes it unlawful to manufacture, import, sell, ship, deliver, possess, transfer, or receive an undetectable firearm.\nMany anti-gun politicians and members of the media have wrongly claimed that 3-D printing technology will allow for the production and widespread proliferation of undetectable plastic firearms, Cox added. \nPo Murray, chairwoman of Newtown Action Alliance, a gun control group created after the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary in 2013, said, there is nothing good that can come with Defense Distributed uploading these files. She said, our laws and our policies have to keep up with the changing advancements in technology.\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control, in 2015 there were 36,252 firearm-related deaths in the U.S., with 12,979 of those homicides.\nSources: CBS News, FOX News, The New York Times",

      "Content": "On Tuesday, former movie producer Harvey Weinstein pleaded not guilty to three felony counts, first-degree rape, third-degree rape and a first-degree criminal sex act, during his arraignment at New Yorks Supreme Court. Weinstein has been out on $1 million bail since he turned himself in to New York City police on May 25. Weinstein is scheduled to appear in court for a hearing on September 20, according to his attorney, Benjamin Brafman.\nAs terrible a crime as rape is, it is equally reprehensible to be falsely accused of rape, Brafman said. And since Mr. Weinstein has denied these allegations, thats where we are.\nThe charges against Weinstein relate to allegations from two women in separate incidents: one in 2004 involving Lucia Evans, and another in 2013 involving a woman whose identity has been sealed as part of the criminal proceedings. The maximum possible total sentence for the charges is 37 years in prison, according to Fox News.\nA grand jury indicted Weinstein, 66, on the charges last Wednesday. It is still hearing evidence and could add charges in the case, The New York Times reported.\nThe New York Times and The New Yorker published articles last October in which at least 13 women accused Weinstein of sexual misconduct or harassment. In total, more than 80 women have made public accusations against Weinstein, according to Fox News. Weinstein has said he never engaged in non-consensual sexual behavior with anyone, according to Brafman.\nCivil lawsuit\nOn Friday, three women filed a separate class-action lawsuit against Weinstein and some of his former employers. One of the plaintiffs, Melissa Thompson, alleges Weinstein raped her in a hotel room in 2011. Another, Caitlin Dulany, alleges that Weinstein performed oral sex on her without her consent in 1996. A third plaintiff, Larissa Gomes, alleges that Weinstein touched her breasts and forced her to kiss him in 2000. \nThe class-action lawsuit also alleges that some of Weinsteins employers may have concealed his conduct or were part of a decadeslong campaign to squelch complaints or illegally procure the silence of victims, witnesses and others.\nThe New York Police Department said the three womens allegations were beyond the statute of limitations; they are not part of the criminal proceedings to which Weinstein pleaded not guilty on Tuesday. \nSources: CNN 1, CNN 2, Fox News, The New York Times",

      "Content": "On Saturday, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said his two days of talks with North Korean officials were productive and that progress was made on almost all the central issues. Later in the day, North Korea issued a statement through its state-run KCNA news agency that said The issues the U.S. side insisted on at the talks are all roots of troubles, which the previous administrations also had insisted on to disrupt the dialogue processes, stoke the distrust and increase the danger of war.\nDuring his visit, Pompeo met with Gen. Kim Yong Chol, the vice chairman of the country's Party Central Committee. After a meeting of about three hours on Friday, Kim Yong Chol said there were aspects to clarify, and Pompeo said, There are things that I have to clarify as well. Pompeo did not meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.\nState Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said Pompeo was very firm in pursuing three goals during the visit: the complete denuclearization of North Korea, security assurances and the repatriation of the remains of soldiers killed in the Korean War.\nNauert said Pompeo left Kim a letter from President Donald Trump. The North Korean statement said Pompeo had also been given a letter from Kim to Trump.\nNauert also said Pompeo called Washington on Saturday morning to update the president, White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly and national security adviser John Bolton on the talks.\nJoining Pompeo on his trip were other officials from the State Department, as well as from the National Security Council and the CIA. On Saturday, Pompeo left North Korea for Tokyo, where he briefed Japanese and South Korean officials on the talks on Sunday.\nPompeos comments after the meetings\nBefore leaving Pyongyang for Tokyo, Pompeo told reporters, \"We had many hours of productive conversations. These are complicated issues, but we've made progress on almost all the central issues. Some places, a great deal of progress. Other places, there's still more work to be done.\" \nWhen asked whether he raised the subject of satellite images possibly showing North Korean nuclear facility expansions, Pompeo said, \"We talked about what the North Koreans are continuing to do and how it's the case we can get our arms around achieving what Chairman Kim and President Trump both agreed to, which was the complete denuclearization of North Korea.\" He added, Theyre still equally committed. Chairman Kim is still committed [to denuclearization].\nPompeo also said the two sides had discussed what the modalities would look like for the destruction of the North Korean missile engine testing facility, and said there was some progress there as well. He said, we have laid out a path for further negotiations at the working level so that the two teams can get together and continue these discussions. Nauert said the two countries agreed to set up working groups in the future to discuss the nitty-gritty stuff, including how the U.S. would verify North Korean efforts to denuclearize.\nAt Trump and Kims June 12 meeting in Singapore, they agreed to the repatriation of U.S. soldiers remains from North Korea. Trump said last month at a rally in Minnesota that 200 U.S. service members remains had been sent back. U.S. military officials later said they had not received any remains.\nPompeo said the two sides set up a meeting in Panmunjom for July 12 that could move by one day or two, in which officials would discuss the repatriation of remains at the border, and that the process will begin to develop over the days that follow. He added that it was a very productive conversation about the process by which we will deliver on the commitments that were made in the Singapore summit.\nNorth Koreas statement\nThe North Korean statement said, the U.S. side came up only with its unilateral and gangster-like demand for denuclearization just calling for [complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization]  all of which run counter to the spirit of the Singapore summit meeting and talks. The statement added, We expected the U.S. to bring constructive measures to build confidence in accordance with the spirit of the U.S.-North Korea Summit.\nThe statement said that a shorter way to denuclearization on the Korean peninsula is to remove deep-rooted mistrust and follow the principle of simultaneous actions in resolving what is feasible one by one while giving priority to creating trust.\nThe statement said the U.S. suspension of joint military exercises with South Korea was highly reversible and could be resumed anytime at any moment as all of its military force remains intact in its previously-held positions. It added that this is incomparable with the irreversible step taken by the DPRK to explode and dismantle the nuclear test ground.\nThe North Korean side, during the talks, put forward the constructive proposals to seek a balanced implementation of all the provisions of the Joint Statement [from Singapore] out of its firm willingness to remain faithful to the implementation of the spirit and agreed points of the DPRK-U.S. summit meeting and talks, the statement read.\nIt continued, These include taking wide-ranging proactive steps of simultaneous actions in a respective manner such as realizing multilateral exchanges for improved relations between North Korea and the U.S.; making public a declaration on the end of [the Korean] war  to build a peace regime on the Korean Peninsula; dismantling the test ground of high thrust engine[s] to make a physical verification of the suspension of ICBM production as part of denuclearization steps; and making an earliest start of the working-level talks for recovering POW/MIA remains.\nThe Norths statement said, The U.S. side never mentioned the issue of establishing a peace regime on the Korean peninsula which is essential for defusing tension and preventing a war.\nThe statement also read, We still cherish our good faith in President Trump.\nThe White House declined to comment on North Koreas statement, according to CNN.\nOn Sunday in Tokyo, Pompeo said, \"If those [disarmament] requests were gangster-like, the world is a gangster, because there was a unanimous decision at the UN Security Council about what needs to be achieved. He also said, Sanctions will remain in place until final, fully verified denuclearisation as agreed to by Chairman Kim occurs.\nSources: AFP, CNN, KCNA Watch, Reuters, The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post, U.S. State Department",

The OGE said it expected the EPA to review and analyze Pruitts rental agreement with a lobbyist whose husbands clients were seeking action by the EPA, his expenses for travel, security, and salaries for some employees, his alleged use of subordinates time in his housing search potentially being a misuse of his position, and his alleged decision to reassign or demote staff who were attempting to ensure that his expenses and other actions were in accordance with laws and regulations.\nThe EPAs inspector general and the Government Accountability Office are investigating Pruitts actions.

      "Content": "Militant groups in Syria blew up two bridges Friday that link areas they control to government-held territories in the northwestern al-Ghab plains area, near Hama. The militant groups destroyed the Beit Ras and al-Sharia bridges, which connect territory they control with the government-controlled villages of al-Jeed and al-Karim. \nThe U.K.-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the bridge detonations were a response to an increase in military reinforcements allied with the Syrian government sent to areas such as Hama and Idlib. (The city of Idlib is about 60 miles north of the city of Hama.) The Syrian government has reportedly sent tens of thousands of armed troops and deployed more than 2,000 armored vehicles to the area in recent weeks, according to the Observatory.\nReuters reported on Thursday that the Syrian government was planning an attack on Idlib, which the outlet described as the last major opposition-held area in Syria. Russia, which supports Syrian President Bashar Assads government, has conducted airstrikes in the area in recent months, and says a military operation in the area is necessary to remove the terrorists it says attacked Russian military bases. \nThe Syrian command has taken a decision to defeat al-Nusra Front in Idlib no matter the sacrifices that it would entail, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moallem said on Thursday. Al-Nusra is an al-Qaida-linked militant group considered to be terrorists by the U.N. and some countries. \nAbout 3 million people live in Idlib and surrounding areas, and some of them have already been displaced and relocated there since the beginning of the war more than seven years ago, the Associated Press reported. \nWhile al-Qaida-linked groups control much of Idlib province, groups supported by Turkey and independent Islamist opposition groups also control parts of the region, AP reported. The Observatory did not specify which militant group reportedly destroyed the bridges.\nTwo other bridges remain in the area and could be used by government forces to move into territory controlled by militant groups, said Rami Abdurrahman, head of war monitoring for the Observatory.\nThe Observatory reported that several bridges have been destroyed in the area over the years by both militant and government forces in an attempt to fortify controlled territory from attack. \n\nSources: AP, AFP, SOHR",

Residents near the road were ordered to evacuate, adding to the nearly 2,000 people who had already been evacuated since the original eruption.\nThe 17th fissure was reported Saturday night, according to the U.S. Geological Surveys Hawaiian Volcano Observatory (USGS).\nAnother fissure, the 16th, was reported earlier Saturday. It produced a lava flow that traveled about 250 yards before stalling, officials said. That fissure was about a mile east of the Puna Geothermal Venture plant, where officials removed 60,000 gallons of flammable liquids due to safety concerns.\nUSGS officials said that an explosive eruption is possible at the Halemaumau crater, which is atop the Kilauea volcano. We still have a highly active volcano here at Kilauea, said Tina Neal, USGS scientist-in-charge at the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory. The situation remains unstable. Additional outbreaks of lava are likely.\nPresident Trump declared a major disaster on the Big Island on Friday. The declaration allows federal assistance to supplement state and local recovery efforts in areas affected by the Kilauea volcanic eruption.\nThe estimated cost to protect residents over the next 30 days is expected to exceed $2.9 million, according to the Hawaiian governor's office.\nSources: Al Jazeera, CNN",

In a statement on Sunday, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Commissioner Kevin McAleenan said San Ysidro had reached capacity and the asylum-seekers \"may need to wait in Mexico while CBP officers processed those already in the facilities. Some groups of people tried to enter the U.S. illegally by climbing over a metal fence, according to a statement on Saturday by Rodney Scott, San Diego Chief Patrol Agent of CBP. \nLast week, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen issued a statement saying immigrants seeking asylum should do so in the first safe country they reach, including Mexico. To qualify for asylum in the U.S., applicants must prove they have been persecuted or fear persecution based on their race, religion, nationality, political belief or membership in a particular group, according to The New York Times. \nIf immigrants request asylum at a port of entry, they are referred to an asylum officer for initial screening, which is called a credible-fear interview, and those who pass then present their case before a judge. While waiting for a court date, applicants could be released and if so, they wear an ankle-bracelet monitor, The New York Times reported. Applicants who are rejected in the screening process could be detained and deported.\nScott said it is a crime to enter the U.S. somewhere other than through a port of entry, and that immigrants caught doing so would be arrested and referred for prosecution. He also said that anyone who encouraged immigrants to illegally enter the U.S., or make any false statements to officials, were giving bad advice and placing immigrants and their families at risk.\nThe caravan is made up of immigrants from Central America who began traveling north from the city of Tapachula, Mexico, on March 25. At one point, the caravan was made up of 1,200 people, according to The New York Times. Some of the immigrants may apply for protection in other countries, such as Mexico, and others may apply for asylum in the U.S. at a later date.\nOther caravans have made northward journeys in the past, according to The Washington Post. Media outlets followed the caravan after President Donald Trump tweeted about it on April 1. Volunteer immigration lawyers and paralegals from San Diego, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Las Vegas traveled to Tijuana to help the immigrants with their asylum requests, according to The New York Times.\nIn an April 23 tweet, Trump said he had instructed the Secretary of Homeland Security not to let these large Caravans of people into our Country.\nSources: Breitbart, CNN, Fox News, The New York Times, The Washington Post",

On Tuesday, Conyers said, Whatever [the allegations] are, they are not accurate, they are not true and I think that they are something that I cant explain where they came from.\nConyers, 88, served 27 terms as a congressman since his first election in 1964, making him the longest serving member of the House of Representatives.\nConyers great-nephew Ian Conyers has also announced a bid for the now vacant Michigan House seat.\nSources: The New York Times, Reuters, The Guardian",

At the meeting, a woman from the audience said, \"Maternal love is the love that's going to change the future of mankind.\" Trudeau responded by saying, We like to say peoplekind, not necessarily mankind, because its more inclusive. The crowd then cheered and the woman laughed, saying, \"There you go, exactly. Yes, thank you.\" Some media outlets and social media users criticized Trudeau's comment.\nOn Wednesday, Trudeau said he made a \"dumb\" joke that \"played well\" at the time, adding that \"out of context, it doesn't play so well.\" He said it was a reminder to him that \"I shouldn't be making jokes even when I think they're funny.\"\nSome media outlets and individuals on social media criticized Trudeau for being \"too politically correct,\" according to The Globe and Mail.\nBefore the exchange at the meeting, the woman who spoke to Trudeau thanked him for recently fill[ing] the seats of your cabinet with female leaders. Trudeau has called himself a feminist. He appointed an equal number of men and women to his cabinet, and has nominated a woman to Canada's Supreme Court. \nTrudeau began a four-day visit to the U.S. Wednesday, first visiting the University of Chicago's Institute of Politics, where he spoke about trade.\nSources: The Globe and Mail, The New York Times, The Daily Caller, Toronto Sun",

      "Content": "Iran strongly condemns an Israeli attack on targets in Syria Thursday, calling them a blatant violation of Syria's sovereignty, foreign ministry spokesman Bahram Qasemi said on Friday. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it carried out airstrikes on at least 70 Iranian targets in Syria on Thursday in response to what it said was Irans Quds Force launching 20 rockets towards Israels front defensive line in Golan Heights early that day. Iran has not directly confirmed or denied firing the rockets, though it said Israels airstrikes were founded on baseless pretexts.\nMost of the Golan Heights territory, internationally recognized as part of Syria, has been occupied by Israel since 1967, and later annexed. Thursdays airstrikes were the largest attack Israel has carried out on Syrian territory since the start of the Syrian war in 2011, according to BBC. IDF Spokesman Brig.-Gen. Ronen Manelis said Russia was informed of the strikes in advance. \nIran, which supports Syrian President Bashar al-Assads government in the war, has deployed hundreds of troops in Syria. Qasemi said Friday Israels attacks on Syrian soil go against all international conventions, and said Israel cannot stand peace and stability in the region and tries to make itself safe by making the region all the more unstable.\nIsrael said there were no injuries from the rockets reportedly launched by Iran shortly after midnight on Thursday morning. All of the targets struck by the Israeli airstrikes in response were Quds Force sites, the IDF said. \nSyrian state news outlet SANA reported Syrian air defenses shot down scores of missiles and prevent[ed] most of them from reaching their targets. SANA also reported that the Israeli strikes killed three people and injured two, according to The Jerusalem Post. The U.K.-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said at least 23 people were killed in the strikes.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Thursday that the Israeli strikes were a consequence of Iran crossing a red line, adding that the country would not allow Iran to entrench itself in Syria. He noted, our action is directed against Iranian targets in Syria. However, if the Syrian military acts against us, we will act against it.\nRecent developments with Iran nuclear agreement\nThis week, President Donald Trump withdrew the U.S. from the 2015 Iran nuclear agreement, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), under which international sanctions were removed from Iran in exchange for limits to its nuclear program. Trump announced the U.S. would reintroduce sanctions on Iran. Netanyahu had earlier claimed Iran lied when it said it didnt have a nuclear weapons program, and Israel supported the U.S. withdrawal.\nIn a statement on Friday, Iran said it was preparing to pursue uranium enrichment in case the nuclear deal ends. Iran is taking all necessary steps in preparation for Iran to pursue industrial-scale enrichment without any restrictions, using the results of the latest research and development of Iran's brave nuclear scientists, Foreign Minister Javad Zarif said. The U.K., France and Germany said they still support the deal.\nSources: BBC, PressTV, The Jerusalem Post, SANA, USA Today",

The statement said Quang passed after the utmost efforts to treat him by Vietnamese and foreign professors and doctors and care by the party and state leaders. The statement did not specify what the illness was. \nNguyen Quoc Trieu, the former health minister, was quoted in state-run online newspaper VnExpress saying that Quang had been sick due to a rare toxic virus he contracted last year, without naming the virus. The president had traveled to Japan multiple times for treatment, Trieu said. \nJapanese professors and doctors treated him and helped consolidate the presidents health for about a year, Trieu said. However, there are no medicines in the world that can cure the illness completely, instead it only could prevent and push it back for some time.\nQuangs last public appearance was on Wednesday at a Communist Party meeting and reception for a public delegation. Quang had been president since April 2016. \nIn Vietnam, the presidency is the second highest political position in the country, after the leader of the Communist Party, according to The Associated Press. The Communist Party holds 475 of the 500 seats in the National Assembly. Only between 25 and 50 non-Communist Party candidates ran as candidates in the last election, according to 2016 remarks made by the Chairman of the National Assembly, Nguyen Sinh Hung.\nThe National Assembly is scheduled to convene next month and elect a new president, AP reported. The current vice president is Dang Thi Ngoc Thinh. If elected, she would become the countrys first female president. \n\nSources: Al Jazeera, AP, Vietnamnet, Vietnam Now",

      "Content": "Venezuelans voted on Sunday to allow President Nicolas Maduro to create a new legislative body called a Constituent Assembly, or la constituyente, which will have the power to rewrite the countrys constitution. Voters were asked to elect 545 members for the assembly from a list of 6,000 candidates. The election did not give Venezuelans an option to vote against the assemblys creation, according to The New York Times. This will be the second time Venezuela has had a Constituent Assembly. The first one was in 1999, Al Jazeera reports.\nOn Sunday night, the National Electoral Council (CNE) said 8.1 million people voted in the election, which is about 41.5 percent of registered voters. (Venezuela's population is about 31 million people.) The investment bank Torino Capital and pollster Innovarium reported different figures and estimated between 3.1 and 4 million people voted, based on exit polls. \nThe election did not include electoral observers  independent parties that assess election processes  or mechanisms to prevent people from voting more than once, The Wall Street Journal reported. The New York Times said that the government barred it and other news outlets from entering polling stations. \nOn Monday, after the vote, the U.S. Treasury Department imposed sanctions on Maduro and other current and former government officials. The sanctions prohibit Americans from engaging in economic dealings with Maduro, and freeze any of his assets under U.S. jurisdiction.\nOpposition and protests\nThe opposition boycotted the election and had no candidates on the ballot, CNN reported. Maduro said that two weeks ago his representatives offered to allow the opposition to add candidates and delay the vote by 15 days. He said the opposition did not accept the offer and called the vote illegitimate.\nOn July 16, the opposition held an unofficial referendum on whether people supported or disapproved of the creation of a Constituent Assembly. The Wall Street Journal reported that 7.5 million participated in that referendum and The New York Times said 98 percent of voters were opposed to rewriting the Constitution.\nAt least 125 people have been killed during protests since April, according to the Venezuelan attorney general's office. Police used tear gas against protesters in Caracas on Sunday, CNN reports; the National Guard was also present at the demonstrations. Explosions reportedly occurred in the Altamira area.\nOn Saturday night, one of the Constituent Assembly candidates, Jos Flix Pineda, was killed in his house. Opposition leader Ricardo Campos was reported dead on Sunday morning. Both deaths are being investigated by state prosecutors.\n\nSources: Al Jazeera,CNN, Reuters, The New York Times",

      "Content": "Comey memos on Trump conversations released\nMemos written by FBI Director James Comey outlining his interactions with President Donald Trump were released to Congress on Thursday evening, and published in media reports. The memos, partially redacted, describe four in person conversations and three phone calls that took place between Comey and Trump between Jan. 7, 2017 and April 11, 2017. After the release of the memos, the president tweeted that they showed there was no collusion or obstruction of justice, and later tweeted that Comey had lied.\nSome of the interactions Comey described in the 15 pages of memos were previously publicly discussed in his testimony before Congress last June. Last May, The New York Times reported that Comey had written a memo about a Feb. 14, 2017 conversation in which Trump allegedly said he hoped Comey could let this go, referring to former national security advisor Lt. Gen. Mike Flynn. \nThe memo released Thursday gives the same account. Trump reportedly told Comey that Flynn was a good guy who had been through a lot, adding that the president fired him because he misled Vice President Mike Pence. I replied by saying, I agree he is a good guy, but said no more, Comey wrote in the memo.\nFlynn later pleaded guilty last December to lying to the FBI, as part of special counsel Robert Muellers investigation into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.\nAfter the Times report on the memo last year, the White House released a statement saying media reports of the memo were not a truthful or accurate portrayal of the conversation between the President and Mr. Comey. \nThe newly released memos also cite another conversation between Trump and Comey about Flynn. At a Jan. 28, 2017 meeting, Trump allegedly said Flynn had serious judgment issues. According to a memo dated Feb. 8, 2017, then-White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus reportedly asked Comey if there was a FISA (Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act) order on Flynn. (For more on the act, read here). \nIn another newly released memo, Comey describes a dinner with Trump in which the president allegedly said, I need loyalty. Comey replied that he would get honesty, according to his memo, to which Trump reportedly said he wanted honest loyalty. Comey said he responded, you will get that from me. He wrote that he chose to understand the meaning of that to be serving the president with loyalty to the office, the country and the truth.\nSome of the memos were addressed to then FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, then FBI chief of staff James Rybicki, and then General Counsel to the FBI James Baker. All three have since either resigned or been fired from the FBI. Comey was dismissed from the FBI on May 9, 2017.\nThe release\nThe Justice Department sent the redacted version of the memos to Congress on Thursday, after a request from three Republican House chairmen last week. The request was made by House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.), House Oversight Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.), and House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.). \nGoodlatte, Dowdy and Nunes said in a statement that Comey showed political bias by having at least two different standards in his interactions with others, referring to his decision not to document interactions with former President Barack Obama. \nThe Justice Department said the unredacted, still classified versions would be made available to Congress for secure viewing on Friday. \nTrumps response\nOn Thursday night, Trump tweeted in response to the memos release, James Comey Memos just out and show clearly that there was NO COLLUSION and NO OBSTRUCTION. Also, he leaked classified information. WOW! Will the Witch Hunt continue? \nOn Friday morning, he tweeted, So General Michael Flynns life can be totally destroyed while Shadey (sic) James Comey can Leak and Lie and make lots of money from a third rate book (that should never have been written). Is that really the way life in America is supposed to work? I dont think so!\n\nRead the full memos here.\n\nSources: Comey memo, CNN, Fox News, Newsweek, Politico, The Washington Post",

These competing claims to East Jerusalem are one of the disputes in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\nSince the 1979 Camp David Accords, U.S. presidents have chosen not to move the embassy or recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, NBC News reported.\nUpdate: During a speech from the White House on Wednesday, Trump said, I have determined that it is time to officially recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.

      "Content": "Russian President Vladimir Putin drove a construction truck across a new 11.8-mile (19 km) bridge connecting Russia and Crimea as part of the bridges opening ceremony on Tuesday. Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. President Petro Poroshenko of Ukraine, which considers the annexation illegal, said the bridge was yet another piece of evidence of the Kremlin ignoring international law and an attempt to legitimize the temporary occupation of the Crimean peninsula.\nPutin spoke to construction workers after crossing the bridge, saying, All the way back in the days of the czars, people dreamed that this bridge would be built. Thanks to your work, thanks to your talent, this project, this miracle has happened.\nPutins drive across the $3.6 billion bridge, built over two years, took about 20 minutes and was broadcast live on Russian television. He was followed by other construction vehicles.\nThe bridge spans the Kerch Strait, a waterway between the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov. Ships from parts of Ukraine would have to be granted access by Russia to cross between the two seas, according to Newsweek. \nUkraines government has filed a lawsuit with The Hague against Russia over the construction, saying Russia has violated the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea by building the bridge.\nThe U.S. and EU have imposed sanctions on Russia over its annexation of Crimea from Ukraine. In 2014, the U.N. General Assembly passed a resolution saying the referendum in Crimea that approved Russias annexation of the peninsula was not authorized by Ukraine and had no validity. The General Assembly called upon U.N. states to not recognize the annexation. \nAuthorities plan to open the bridge to cars on Wednesday. Trucks will not be permitted for several months, which will allow engineers to check the safety and quality of the bridge under car traffic, according to RT. A section of the bridge for trains is scheduled to be completed next year.\nThe construction company that built the bridge is owned by Arkady Rotenberg, who has known Putin since he was a child, according to The Associated Press.\nSources: AP, Newsweek, Newsweek, RT, Ukrinform, UN Resolution",

Myanmar has been accused of trying to silence press freedoms, while the country maintains it was upholding the rule of law. Heres what has happened in the case:\n2017\nDec. 12: Reuters journalists Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo are arrested in the city of Yangon after being invited to meet police officials for dinner. (The journalists later say the police officials gave them documents before others arrested them.) \nDec. 13: The Myanmar government charges the journalists with violating the colonial-era Official Secrets Act, which has a maximum penalty of 14 years in prison. (The country was previously under British rule.)\nDec. 17: Myanmar Vice President Myint Swe authorizes the police to proceed with a case against the journalists.\nDec. 21: A Myanmar police spokesman announces that the journalists have been remanded to custody after a court appearance.\nDec. 24: The journalists appear in court after being held at an undisclosed location without outside contact for two weeks, Reuters reports. They are remanded to custody for another two weeks.\n2018\nJan.10: The journalists appear in court again. Prosecutors seek to charge them for violating the Official Secrets Act.\nJan. 23: At a court hearing, Myanmar police say they sought to investigate the journalists for Official Secrets Act violations an hour after their arrest.\nFeb.1: During cross-examination, a police witness says that information in the documents that the journalists were holding at the time of their arrest had already been published in newspaper reports. The court denies the journalists bail and sends them back to Insein prison. \nFeb. 6: A police officer who arrested the journalists says he burned his notes from the time of the arrest, according to Reuters.\nFeb. 10: Reuters publishes the journalists article, which reports that government forces and local Buddhists in Rakhine state were involved in the killing of 10 Rohingya Muslim men who were later buried in a mass grave in the state.\nFeb. 11: Myanmar says it will take action against members of its security forces associated with the killings reported by Reuters; it says its actions against the security forces are not related to the Reuters report.\nFeb. 21: A civilian scheduled to testify in the case reportedly provides evidence in court that contradicts statements by police and prosecutors about the place where the journalists were arrested.\nMarch 28: Lawyers for the journalists ask the court to throw out the case, citing insufficient evidence presented by the prosecution.\nApril 11: Judge Ye Lwin rejects the defenses request to dismiss the case.\nApril 20: Police Captain Moe Yan Naing testifies for the prosecution that a police chief had given orders to entrap the journalists by giving them secret documents and then arresting them.\nApril 25: Prosecutors claim that the police captain should be declared an unreliable witness. The defense objects to the prosecutions argument.\nApril 29: A police spokesman announces that the officer who testified that the journalists had been framed has been sentenced to an undisclosed prison term for violating Myanmar's Police Disciplinary Act.\nMay 2: Judge Ye Lwin rejects the prosecutors request to declare Police Captain Moe Yan Naing an unreliable witness. Seven days later, the captain testifies again, providing additional details about how the journalists were allegedly framed by police.\nJuly 2: After hearing from additional police witnesses, and reviewing the case evidence, prosecutors and defense lawyers deliver final arguments in the pre-trial phase of the case.\nJuly 9: The court charges the journalists with breaching the Official Secrets Act. They plead not guilty.\nJuly 17: During his testimony, Wa Lone, one of the journalists, says that he questioned police about the killing of Rohingya Muslims, not about secret state documents he and his colleague are accused of obtaining.\nAug. 20: Prosecutors and defense lawyers deliver final arguments.\nSept. 3: Journalists Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo are sentenced to seven years in prison for breaching the Official Secrets Act.\n\nSources: Burma vs Myanmar, Pence Twitter, Reuters, Reuters timeline, U.S. State Department - Burma, World Economic Forum interview",

A portion of the tariffs is scheduled to go into effect on July 6. Chinas Ministry of Commerce said it would immediately take tariff measures of the same scale and intensity, adding that all economic and trade outcomes of previous talks will now lose effect.\nThe USTR listed 1,102 products which will be subject to the new tariffs, with 818 products, worth about $34 billion, to be charged duty beginning July 6. The remaining 284 products, worth about $16 billion, would undergo further review in a public notice and comment process, including a public hearing before tariffs are applied, according to the USTR statement. \nThe U.S. first announced plans for imposing 25 percent tariffs on Chinese products in April, and China responded by proposing tariffs on U.S. products. During discussions between the the two countries in May, the tariffs were put on hold, according to Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin. At the time, China also agreed to significantly increase its purchase of U.S. goods and services. On May 29, the White House announced it would implement the 25 percent tariffs, and said the list of specific products would be announced on June 15. \nThe tariffs are being implemented under section 301 of the U.S. Trade Act of 1974, which allows the president to take action against unfair or discriminatory trade practices, or trade agreement violations. A USTR section 301 investigation concluded the acts, policies, and practices of the Government of China related to technology transfer, intellectual property, and innovation covered in the investigation are unreasonable or discriminatory and burden or restrict U.S. commerce. \nThe American public will be able to request tariff exclusions for U.S. companies, according to the USTR statement, which said details would be made public in the next few weeks.\nFor more on U.S. trade actions announced this year, see the timeline here.\nSources: USTR Statement, CNN, The New York Times, Xinhua",

      "Content": "On Thursday, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced a proposal for new corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards it and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) developed for model year 2021 to 2026 vehicles. A government fact sheet said the CAFE standards required for model year 2025 would be 37.0 miles per gallon (mpg), compared to the 46.7 mpg projected under rules proposed in 2012. The proposal would remove Californias ability to set its own emission standards. The public will have 60 days to comment on the plan.\nAccording to the EPA, fuel economy numbers posted on new vehicle windows are, on average, 20 to 25 percent lower than CAFE fuel economy numbers. For instance, 37 mpg would be higher than the average of about 28 to 30 mpg seen by consumers on new vehicle windows.\nActing EPA head Andrew Wheeler said, Our proposal aims to strike the right regulatory balance based on the most recent information and create a 50-state solution that will enable more Americans to afford newer, safer vehicles that pollute less. He added that more realistic standards can save lives while continuing to improve the environment. \nThe EPAs announcement said the proposal reflects a balance of safety, economics, technology, fuel conservation, and pollution reduction. It is anticipated to prevent thousands of on-road fatalities and injuries as compared to the standards set forth in the 2012 final rule.\nThe EPA said the new standards would lower the costs of new vehicles, which it said are safer, and in turn would result in more people buying new, safer vehicles. In support of its claim on fatalities, the EPA cited a 2018 study by the NHTSA that indicated newer vehicles are safer than older vehicles. The study found this was both due to newer model year vehicles showing lower percentages of accident fatalities than older vehicles, and due to the percentage of fatalities increasing as a vehicle ages for a given model year. The study did not provide reasons for why these trends were observed, and noted the NHTSA had not analyzed the data for factors such as age of drivers and relative rates of seatbelt use. \nThe study used, as a measure of safety, the average percentage of occupants killed in accidents that involved at least one fatality for cars, SUVs, pickup trucks and vans. Regarding that measure, the study did not take into account the possible effects of varying average vehicle occupancy rates with vehicle age, for instance. Nor did it take into account changes in percentages of vehicles on the road that were cars versus SUVs. In 2012, cars accounted for about 50 percent of new vehicle sales, and now they account for about one-third, with trucks and SUVs making up some of the rest, according to The Associated Press.\nIn 2017, there were 37,150 fatalities on U.S. roads, according to the Post.\nNationwide standards\nIn addition to setting fuel economy standards to remain the same after 2020, the EPA proposal would also make emission requirements equal in all 50 states. As granted by the 1970 Clean Air Act, California has had the ability to set its own emission standards and thus, indirectly, fuel economy, The Washington Post reported. Twelve other states and the District of Columbia have since adopted Californias standards. California would not be able to set its own standards under the new EPA proposal. Passenger vehicle sales in California and areas following its standards account for about a third of total U.S. sales, according to CNN. It adds to manufacturers costs to satisfy two sets of emissions standards, state and federal, rather than one.\nIn May, California and 16 other states sued the EPA over its decision to rescind 2012 emission standards regulations that the EPA implemented in January 2017. On Thursday, 19 state attorneys general joined California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, who said his the state would use every legal tool at its disposal to defend todays national standards and reaffirm the facts and science behind them. U.S. officials said they would like to meet with California officials to mutually agree on regulation, according to CNN. Becerra said he was willing to meet with federal officials and that so far we have not had a receptive audience in the Trump administration.\nFact sheet on the proposed standards\nIn a fact sheet, the U.S. Department of Transportation and the EPA said there would be a $2,340 reduction in overall average vehicle ownership costs for new vehicles under the new standards, though it did not specify the model year the change would affect. In 2016, the EPA and NHTSA released estimates of costs ranging from about $900 to $1,200 per vehicle to comply with new standards by model year 2025, according to the Post. The fact sheet does not mention if increased gas costs from decreased fuel economy were included in its $2,340 cost reduction.\nThe fact sheet said up to 1,000 lives would be saved annually from crash fatalities as consumers buy more new cars that are safer under the proposed standards. It did not say what effect the new standards might have on lives lost due to air pollution. \nThe fact sheet also said there would be a more than $500 billion reduction in societal costs over 50 years, including technology costs, as well as costs from accident casualties and additional congestion and noise. \nIt also said there would be a $252.6 billion reduction in regulatory costs for manufacturers through model year 2029, and a reduction of hybrid vehicles needed to comply with fuel economy standards from 56 percent to 3 percent in model year 2030. The fact sheet said there was a projected increase of 3/1,000th of a degree Celsius in global average temperature by the year 2100 resulting from the new standards. \nResponse to the proposal\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said the EPAs proposal was a \"dangerous assault on clean air and public health in California and across the nation.\" Pelosi said the illegal and unjust attack on the vital clean air protections set by California and the 12 states that join it will choke our communities with smog. Pelosi said California would \"continue to work with automakers to overcome the Trump obstruction to build cleaner, more affordable and safe vehicles for our communities.\"\nGloria Bergquist, spokeswoman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, said, With todays release of the Administrations proposals, its time for substantive negotiations to begin. We urge California and the federal government to find a common sense solution that sets continued increases in vehicle efficiency standards while also meeting the needs of Americas drivers.\nPresident and Chief Executive of the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers Mitch Bailwol said in April that his organization remains absolutely convinced that one national program [for setting fuel economy standards] is the preferred policy path.\nJack Gillis, the Consumer Federation of America's director of public affairs, said, \"Our analysis clearly indicates that the car companies are fully capable of meeting the [2012] CAFE standards and they are able to do so with great savings for consumers.\n\nSources: AP, CNN, Fox News, NBC News, The Washington Post, EPA 1, EPA 2",

      "Content": "The U.N. Special Envoy for Syria offered to personally escort residents of Idlib province to safety before the Syrian government launches an attack on militant groups controlling the region. Idlib province is considered the last major opposition-held area in Syria, and the countrys president, Bashar Assad, was reportedly planning an attack on the area, according to Reuters. \nThe U.N.s Staffan de Mistura said the northwestern province has about 10,000 al-Nusra or al-Qaida members that the U.N. has labeled as terrorists. \nIdlib has an estimated population of about 3 million people. According to the U.N., many of Syrian civilians have traveled to Idlib seeking refuge from other conflict zones in the country during Syrias 7-1/2-year-old civil war. About 500,000 people have reportedly arrived in Idlib over the past six months. The U.N. has said a full-scale military operation on Idlib could risk a humanitarian catastrophe.\nAccording to the U.N., the militant groups and the Syrian government both have the ability to create chemical weapons. Avoiding the potential use of chemical weapons is indeed crucial, de Mistura told reporters. Although the Syrian government has a right to fight U.N.-identified terrorists and recover lost territory, theres no justification to using chemical weapons in densely populated areas, de Mistura added. \nSyrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moallem said, I assure you that we do not have chemical weapons and are not able to use them, according to Syrian state news agency SANA.\nIdlib is currently covered by an ceasefire agreement between Russia, Turkey and Iran. Russia and Iran are allied with the Syrian government and have given it military support in fighting militant groups such as al-Qaida and the Islamic State. Turkey has militarily supported some of the militant groups that oppose Assads government.\nWhen questioned by reporters, de Mistura said he had no specific information that an attack on Idlib was imminent. But I do have eyes and information regarding preparations and build-ups and messages and declarations, he said, adding that while we are talking, two of the main guarantors  in this case Turkey and the Russian Federation  are trying and we hope will succeed, in avoiding the worst-case scenario.\nThe next U.N.-led meeting to discuss the Syrian war is scheduled for Sept. 10 and 11 in Geneva, Switzerland, with representatives from Russia, Turkey and Iran, de Mistura said.\n\nSources: AP, Reuters, U.N. statement",

(Slaughters website states that cases of domestic violence have reduced by 67 percent since the bill was passed.)\n\tServing as the first woman to chair the House Committee on Rules, a position she held from 2007 to 2011. She then served as the Ranking Member on the committee until her death. \n\tAuthoring the STOCK Act (Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge), which became law in 2012.

The jury of seven women and five men could not reach a consensus on the 18 charges, which included conspiracy, bribery and honest services fraud. \nThe Department of Justice (DOJ) has not announced whether it would retry Menendez. A DOJ spokesperson said prosecutors would consider next steps and report to the Court at the appropriate time.\nProsecutors alleged that Menendez granted political favors to his friend Dr. Salomon Melgen, an ophthalmologist, in exchange for campaign donations of more than $600,000, flights on private jets and hotel stays. Both Menendez and Melgen, who was on trial for bribery, deny the allegations. The alleged favors included attempts to help Melgen gain U.S. visas for his girlfriends, to help the doctor with a Medicare billing dispute worth $8.9 million, and to aid in a port security contract between Melgen and the Dominican Republic. \nDuring Menendezs trial, his defense argued that the senator had gotten involved in the the Medicare issue because the billing policies were inconsistent and benefited drug companies. The defense also said Menendez had been involved in the port security contract as part of his general interest in port security. \nMelgen was previously convicted of defrauding Medicare and is awaiting sentencing.\nMenendezs trial lasted 11 weeks and included 57 witnesses. According to one juror, Ed Norris, the jury was divided 10-2 on the last vote in favor of acquittal.\nSources: CNN, The Washington Post",

Each country will send 100 people to a resort in Mount Kumgang, or \"Diamond Mountain,\" in North Korea during August, according to South Koreas Unification Ministry. The nonprofit organization Red Cross will organize the family reunions. \n\"The reunion will be held from August 20 to 26, and 100 participants will be selected from each side,\" a joint statement from the Koreas said, after officials met at the Mount Kumgang resort.\nThe reunions are part of a program the Koreas established in 2000; initially events were held annually, and later decreased. The last reunion was in October 2015, and involved 650 South Koreans visiting relatives in the North. There are 57,000 people registered with the the South Korean Red Cross as being separated from family members. During the Korean War, millions of Koreans were separated from family members on the other sides of the border, BBC reported, some of whom have since passed away. \nThe participants from South Korea are selected at random after taking into account age and family background, according to BBC. They will also be subject to medical exams to assess fitness for travel. \nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un agreed to the family reunions during meetings with South Korean President Moon Jae-in in May and U.S. President Donald Trump earlier this month.\nIn a separate announcement on Friday, Trump signed a declaration to continue pre-existing economic restrictions and sanctions on North Korea, including freezing assets subject to U.S. jurisdiction. The sanctions were implemented under George W. Bush, and were continued and modified under the Obama and Trump administrations. \nThe existence and risk of proliferation of weapons-usable fissile material on the Korean Peninsula [and] the actions and policies of the Government of North Korea ... continue to constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States, said a notice Trump sent to Congress.\nSources: BBC, NBC News, The Washington Post",

      "Content": "A South Korean court sentenced former President Park Geun-hye to an additional eight years in prison on Friday for charges of misusing state funds and violating election laws. The Seoul Central District Court, which also ordered Park to pay a 3.3 billion won ($2.91 million) fine, acquitted her of a bribery charge. Park was previously sentenced in April to 24 years jail time on corruption charges, which her lawyers have appealed. Fridays ruling increases her total sentence to 32 years. \nFridays ruling sentenced Park to six years for charges related to payments she illegally received from a national spy agency, and to two years for interfering in the process to find candidates for her then-ruling party to run in the 2016 parliamentary election. \nPark was found guilty of causing loss of state money, misappropriating funds and embezzlement related to about 3.5 billion won ($3.1 million) the National Intelligence Service (NIS) paid her office between May 2013 and September 2016. She used some of the money to maintain her private residence, pay for medical bills and other expenses, prosecutors alleged. \nPark was found not guilty on Friday of bribery charges related to the NIS payment, with the court ruling that the money was not paid for favors in return. The court said it was typical for the NIS to pay money to supplement the presidents office budget from an untraceable special activities fund, The Korea Herald reported. The payments were made in a fixed amount on a regular basis, which the court said was not normal for a bribe. \nProsecutors had asked the court for a sentence of 15 years for the charges for which Park received eight years. \nPark, who maintains she is not guilty, was not in attendance at the sentencing on Friday. She has boycotted her trial hearings, alleging the case is politically motivated and the judiciary and prosecution are biased against her, BBC reported. Fridays sentencing, as well as her previous sentencing in April, were broadcast on live television. \nBackground\nPark, 66, is the daughter of former President Park Chung-hee, who was killed while in office in 1979. She began her political career in the 1990s and later ran for the presidency. She took office in 2013 as the countrys first female leader.\nIn 2016, protests called for her removal from office as she was being investigated for corruption. In December of that year, South Koreas National Assembly voted to impeach her. Then on March 10, 2017, the Constitutional Court upheld that decision. The ruling meant Park had to leave office and lost her immunity from prosecution. Park is the first democratically elected South Korean president to be impeached.\nPark was arrested on March 31, 2017, and has been in jail since then. \nSouth Korea elected Moon Jae-in as its new president in May of last year.\nApril verdict\nIn April of this year, Park was found guilty, sentenced to 24 years in prison and ordered to pay a fine of 18 billion won ($16.9 million) for 16 of the 18 charges brought against her at the time, mostly related to abuse of power, coercion and bribery. Prosecutors alleged she conspired with her friend Choi Soon-sil to influence companies, including Samsung and retail company Lotte Group, to donate to foundations controlled by Choi. \nPark was accused last year of receiving 59.2 billion won ($52.1 million) in bribes from several companies. Park was also convicted of leaking 47 confidential presidential documents to Choi, who had no political credentials. Park has known Choi since the 1970s.\nParks lawyers have appealed her 24-year sentence, and prosecutors are asking for 30 years during the appeals process for that case. If she loses her appeal and prosecutors receive the 30 years requested, her total sentence could increase to 38 years. The Seoul High Court is scheduled to rule on the case on Aug. 24\nRelated cases\nThe Seoul Central District Prosecutors Office said in April of last year that it had investigated 110 people regarding the alleged bribery involving Choi and Park.\nChoi, in her own case, was convicted and sentenced in February to 20 years in prison.\nThe chairman of the Lotte Group, Shin Dong-bin, was sentenced to two years and six months.\nLee Jae-yong, also known as Jay Y. Lee, a leader and heir to the Samsung Group, was originally sentenced to five years in jail last August. In February, some of his convictions were overturned and the sentence was reduced to two-and-a-half years. The court suspended his sentence for four years, and he was released from jail in the interim.\nSources: AP, AP, BBC, BBC, Reuters, The Korea Herald, The Korea Times",

      "Content": "On Monday, President Donald Trump posted on Twitter about bias in the media, saying Sinclair Broadcast Group was superior to CNN and NBC News. Sinclair is a television broadcasting company that owns or operates 193 U.S. television stations and 614 channels. On Saturday, website Deadspin released a 98-second video that showed clips with news anchors from various Sinclair stations reading the same scripted lines about fake news and personal bias in the media. \nSome lines in the scripted Sinclair broadcasts include:\nThe sharing of biased and false news has become all too common on social media. More alarming, some media outlets publish these same fake stories without checking facts first.\nSome members of the media use their platforms to push their own personal agenda.\nThis is extremely dangerous to our democracy.\nThe local anchors also voiced a commitment to fair, balanced and factual reporting and called on viewers to report on the stations website if viewers believe our coverage is unfair. \nA memo from Sinclairs senior vice president of news directed the stations to read the script, according to CNNMoney. Most content on Sinclair stations is determined at a local level, while Sinclair requires local stations to air so-called must-run pieces up to nine times a week, PBS News reported.\nTimothy Burke, the video editor who created the Deadspin video, said he requested and received more than 50 examples of the statement read on air. The video clips are from broadcasts aired during the month of March, according to NBC News. \nSinclair response\nScott Livingston, Sinclairs senior vice president of news, said on Monday that the goal of the announcement was to reiterate our commitment to reporting facts in a pursuit of truth. He said the company found it curious that it was being attacked for asking our news people to remind their audiences that unsubstantiated stories exist on social media. \nLivingston wrote in a memo to employees, obtained by NBC News, that the stories we are referencing in this campaign are the unsubstantiated ones (i.e. fake/false) like Pope Endorses Trump which move quickly across social media and result in an ill-informed public. Some other false stories, like the false 'Pizzagate' story, can result in dangerous consequences.\nTrumps response\nThe Deadspin video and its contents were reported or referenced on CNN, MSNBC on Monday.\nTrumps Monday tweet on the matter read, So funny to watch Fake News Networks, among the most dishonest groups of people I have ever dealt with, criticize Sinclair Broadcasting for being biased. Sinclair is far superior to CNN and even more Fake NBC, which is a total joke.\nProposed merger\nSinclair stations are in 89 U.S. markets and reach millions of viewers. The group has plans to acquire Tribune Media for $3.9 billion. If the deal is approved, Sinclair would own at least 220 stations, and reach more than 70 percent of U.S. households. Sinclair said if the deal is approved it would sell but continue to operate stations in Chicago and New York.\nThe Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) would need to approve the merger proposal, determining if it adhered to antitrust laws. \nSinclair proposed the merger after the FCC voted 3 to 2 in April of last year to reintroduce a policy on how broadcasters total percentage of the national market is calculated, making it easier for companies to expand. The FCC announced it would reinstate the so-called UHF discount that existed prior to August 2016 and permitted broadcasters to count 50 percent of the television households in their market when determining compliance with the 39 percent national cap.\nOn March 22 of this year, 38 Democratic lawmakers signed a letter requesting that an assistant attorney general reject the Sinclair-Tribune merger, arguing it would result in negative competitive consequences and less local content.\nSources: FCC Press Release, Deadspin Video, AP, Fox News, NBC News, The New York Times",

Trump said again, Thank you very much, and media was asked to leave.\nDuring a press briefing later on Wednesday, a reporter asked White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders about the exchange. Sanders responded by saying that Trump said, No, Im not answering any more questions. And even further, I think even [the reporter] didnt realize what the answer was because she asked for clarification and he didnt answer the follow-up. Sanders also said, I talked to the president. He wasnt answering that question. He was saying, no, hes not taking questions.\nOn Tuesday, Trump said he had full faith and support for Americas great intelligence agencies. Always have. He added, I accept our intelligence communitys conclusion that Russias meddling in the 2016 election took place. Could be other people also; theres a lot of people out there.\nTrump also said that after reviewing the transcripts there was need for some clarification of his statements after his meeting with Putin on Monday. Trump said on Monday at a press conference in Helsinki, My people came to me  [Director of National Intelligence] Dan Coats came to me and some others  they said they think its Russia. I have President Putin; he just said its not Russia. I will say this: I dont see any reason why it would be. \nOn Tuesday, Trump said, I thought it would be obvious, but I would like to clarify just in case it wasnt  In a key sentence in my remarks, I said the word would instead of wouldnt. He said, the sentence should have been: I dont see any reason why it wouldnt be Russia.\nAlso on Tuesday, the White House released a Fact Sheet titled, President Donald J. Trump is Protecting Our Elections and Standing Up to Russias Malign Activities. The fact sheet gave examples of steps the Trump administration has taken to improve election security, and mentioned its expulsion of Russian diplomats, sanctioning of Russian entities and individuals, and confronting of Russian aggression, including the provision of billions of dollars to increase U.S. troop readiness in Europe.\nOther comments by Trump and Sanders\nAt Mondays post-meeting press conference in Helsinki, Putin said the U.S. could ask Russia to interrogate, with U.S. officials present, 12 Russian military officers who were indicted in the U.S. last week for allegedly hacking into the Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee, and releasing stolen emails. Putin said Russia would expect the U.S. to cooperate similarly in a Russian investigation of an American-British investor, William Browder, who is in the U.S. and is accused of financial crimes in Russia. Browder had lobbied for U.S. legislation that sanctioned Russian officials suspected of human rights abuses, following the death of Browders lawyer. \nAt the press conference, Trump said it was an incredible offer to allow the countries intelligence forces to work together on the investigation into alleged cyber attacks.\nOn Wednesday, a reporter asked Sanders, Russian authorities yesterday named several Americans who they want to question, who they claim were involved in Bill Browders crimes, in their terms, including a former ambassador to Russia, Michael McFaul. Does President Trump support that idea? Is he open to having U.S. officials questioned by Russia? Sanders replied, The President is going to meet with his team, and well let you know when we have an announcement on that.\nOn Thursday, Sanders added, It is a proposal that was made in sincerity by President Putin, but President Trump disagrees with it. Hopefully President Putin will have the 12 identified Russians come to the United States to prove their innocence or guilt.\nOn Thursday, Trump tweeted two back-to-back tweets, which together read: The Summit with Russia was a great success, except with the real enemy of the people, the Fake News Media. I look forward to our second meeting so that we can start implementing some of the many things discussed, including stopping terrorism, security for Israel, nuclear............proliferation, cyber attacks, trade, Ukraine, Middle East peace, North Korea and more. There are many answers, some easy and some hard, to these problems...but they can ALL be solved!\nSources: AP, CNN, Politico, The Guardian, The New York Times, The Washington Post, The White House 1, The White House 2, The White House 3, The White House 4\n",

To pass, the bill required 60 votes from the Senate, where 51 Republican senators hold a majority over 47 Democrats. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) co-sponsored the bill. The 1973 Roe v. Wade Supreme Court ruling legalized abortion through about 28 weeks of pregnancy.\nThe Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act argued that a fetus could begin feeling pain after 20 weeks gestation. The bill sought to make performing or attempting to perform an abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy illegal. If passed, doctors would face fines and up to five years in prison if found in violation. The bill exempted women whose lives are deemed at risk, as well as rape and incest victims, provided they reported the crime to authorities, and received medical treatment or counseling at least 48 hours before the abortion.\nAmerican College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists President Haywood L. Brown said the bill ignor[ed] scientific evidence regarding fetal inability to experience pain at the gestational age.\nThe House of Representatives passed an identical bill in October, voting 237 to 189.\nPresident Donald Trump backed the 2018 bill, Politico reported. The Trump administration has allowed states to exclude abortion providers from Medicaid and Title X family planning programs. \nTwenty U.S. states have passed similar bills, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a pro-abortion rights research group that tracks reproductive health policy.\n\nSources: The Wall Street Journal, The Daily Caller, Huffington Post, National Review, Politico",

The plan, to be released Monday, would also grant provisional legal status to DACA enrollees, according to White House aides. As part of the deal, Trump said he wants $25 billion in funding for a U.S.-Mexican border wall and $5 billion for increased border security.\nTrumps plan would also eliminate or change the diversity visa lottery system and put a limit on family-based immigration, the White House said.\nTrump said the immigrants covered under DACA, known as dreamers, could pursue full U.S. citizenship in 10 to 12 years. Dreamers would have to satisfy certain requirements to qualify for citizenship. \nDACA granted work permits to immigrants who arrived in the U.S. illegally as children. Trumps administration announced in September that it was ending DACA and gave Congress six months to pass legislation to continue the program. Enrollees of the program whose permits expired before Mar. 5, 2018 were allowed to apply before Oct. 5, 2017 for a two-year renewal. New permits would not be approved, the announcement said.\nA partial government shutdown occurred on Saturday after lawmakers failed to approve a short-term spending bill the night before. On Monday, the Senate voted to extend government funding until Feb. 8. If they dont pass a spending plan by then, the government may shutdown again. Some lawmakers have indicated that they would not vote for a long-term spending bill unless DACA is addressed.\nSources: The Washington Post, USA Today",

      "Content": "In a speech on the Senate floor on Wednesday, Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) criticized President Donald Trumps comments about U.S. media. Last year, Trump said the press is the enemy of the people. Flake said the president uses words infamously spoken by Joseph Stalin to describe his enemies. \nHe gave the speech on the day Trump had said he would give Fake News Awards to the most corrupt  biased of the Mainstream Media. Trump wrote about the awards in a tweet on Wednesday night. In an opinion piece in The Washington Post on Tuesday, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) also criticized Trumps treatment of the media.\nIn his speech, Flake said 2017 was a year in which truth was more battered and abused than at any time in the history of our country, at the hands of the most powerful figure in our government. He said, The free press is the despots enemy, which makes the free press the guardian of democracy. Flake added that, when a figure in power reflexively calls any press that doesnt suit him fake news, it is that person who should be the figure of suspicion, not the press. \nIn a press briefing Wednesday, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the president and the White House take questions and welcome access to the media every day.\nSanders called Flake a mouthpiece for the oppressive Cuban government, saying hes not criticizing the president because hes against oppression, hes criticizing the president because he has terrible poll numbers and he is looking for some attention. She said the senator was recently defending an actually oppressive regime, referencing his recent trip to Cuba. Flake visited Cuba last week to get briefed on the unexplained health issues affecting U.S. diplomats and their families. He said there was no FBI evidence that Cubans attacked the diplomats and said Cubans bristle at the word attack.\" He said he thought Cubans were\"justified since no evidence of an attack has been produced.\nRepublican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel also tweeted about Flakes speech, saying turn on the news. Its wall-to-wall biased coverage against @POTUS. She added, Comparing the leader of the free world to murderous dictators is absurd. Youve gone too far.\nIn McCains op-ed, he said the phrase fake news  granted legitimacy by an American president  is being used by autocrats to silence reporters, undermine political opponents, stave off media scrutiny and mislead citizens. He also said, Congress must commit to protecting independent journalism, preserving an open and free media environment, and defending the fundamental right to freedom of opinion and expression. He said Trumps criticism of the press is being closely watched by foreign leaders who are already using his words as cover as they silence and shutter one of the key pillars of democracy.\nSources: CNN, Fox News, The Los Angeles Times, The New York Times",

      "Content": "A hurricane, which is also called a tropical cyclone, forms only on warm ocean waters. According to the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), ocean water needs to be about 79.7 degrees Fahrenheit (26.5 Celsius) with a depth of about 50 feet for the water to be warm enough for a hurricane to form. \nWhen warm, moist air on the oceans surface rises, it causes a low pressure area underneath. Air surrounding the high-pressure areas then pushes into the low-pressure area where the air becomes warm and moist, and rises again. According to the NOAA, the process is called a tropical wave.\nAs the air continues to warm and rise, the air around the low-pressure area begins to swirl. A combination of the warm ocean, water vapor and swirling air creates wind. The warm air eventually rises and cools to form clouds. Water condenses in the clouds, forming rain, and sometimes thunderstorms. \nWhen the wind speed reaches 74 miles per hour (119 km/h), the storm is classified as a hurricane. As the storms winds increase in speed, an eye forms in the center of the storm. The eye is a low-pressure system that sucks in higher-pressure air.\nA hurricane loses its wind speed once it passes over land because it no longer has warm ocean water vapor to continue the tropical wave effect. \nAlthough a hurricanes speed may slow over land, it can still cause damaging winds and rainfall.\n\nSources: NASA, NOAA",

The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 affects the collection, sharing and selling of consumer data, while Assembly Bill 1838 prohibits local governments from adding new taxes on sodas until 2031. November ballot initiatives related to each law were withdrawn. \n\nA ballot initiative is a bill or constitutional amendment proposed by a citizen of the state that can become law if approved by voters. Ballot initiatives dont require involvement from the governor or legislature.\nCalifornia Consumer Privacy Act of 2018\nThe Act gives California consumers the right to know what personal data is being collected, why it is being collected and with whom it is shared. Consumers will have the option to prohibit companies, such as Google or Facebook, from selling their information to third parties and the law will affect any business that collects data on their customers. It would not affect companies sharing data without cost. \nMinors under the age of 16 would be required to opt-in for any data collection under the Act. The legislation is scheduled to come into effect in 2020 and could be amended before then. \nThe bill was introduced by state Assembly member Ed Chau and state Sen. Robert Hertzberg on June 21 and was unanimously approved in the Assembly and Senate on Thursday.\nAfter the law was passed, Alastair Mactaggart, a real estate developer who had put forward a ballot initiative regarding data privacy rules, said he would withdraw his measure. A bill can be amended by lawmakers, where ballot initiatives, if approved, can typically only be changed by another ballot initiative, CNN reported.\nAssembly Bill 1838\nAssembly Bill 1838 prohibits local governments from imposing new taxes on soda beverages until Jan. 1, 2031. California cities that have already implemented soda taxes, which include Berkeley, San Francisco, Oakland and Albany, can continue to tax the beverages. \nThe bill was introduced by the Committee on Budget on June 24. It passed the Senate 27-1, with only Democratic senators voting in favor, and some Republican senators abstaining. It passed the Assembly 60-1. \nIn accordance with an agreement between legislators and business representatives, the nonalcoholic beverage industry withdrew a ballot initiative to raise the voter threshold to approve local sales tax increases on any items. The initiative called for a two-thirds supermajority vote of local citizens to approve sales tax measures, an increase from the current 50 percent simple majority for most local taxes. The deadline to withdraw ballot initiatives was Thursday.\nSources: AB-1838, Ballot Initiatives, Consumer Privacy Act, CNN, LOA, Los Angeles Times, Washington Examiner, Wall Street Journal",

      "Content": "North Korea, South Korea and the U.S. are pursuing negotiations to denuclearize the Korean peninsula, but its not the first time. North Korea has previously entered into and, in the past, broken agreements to limit or end its nuclear program. Here is an overview:\n1985: North Korea agrees to Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty\nIn 1985, North Korea signed the United Nations Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), which is intended to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and weapons technology. The agreement, which called on signatories to pursue nuclear disarmament, allowed 18 months for the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to complete an assessment of the Norths nuclear facilities and other inspections and safeguards. North Korea did not complete the IAEA assessment.\n\nIn 1993, the North announced plans to withdraw from the NPT, but the decision was suspended after discussions with the U.S. Then in 2003, North Korea formally withdrew from the NPT.\n1992: Agreement between North and South Korea\nIn January 1992, North and South Korea signed the South-North Joint Declaration on the Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. The countries agreed not to test, manufacture, produce, receive, possess, store, deploy or use nuclear weapons or to possess nuclear reprocessing and uranium enrichment facilities. \nThe agreement included a stipulation for verification through mutual inspections, and the countries established a joint nuclear commission as a mechanism for implementing the agreement. However, negotiations were unsuccessful in reaching an agreement on reciprocal inspections. While the joint declaration was still technically in force, the commission became inactive in 1993.\nIn 2002, North Korea said it had been secretly running a uranium enrichment program, which South Korea, Japan and the U.S. said violated the South-North Joint Declaration. \n1992: The Safeguards Agreement with the IAEA\nIn April 1992, North Korea signed the Safeguards Agreement with the IAEA, set up by the NPT. The following year, initial IAEA inspectors alleged North Koreas reporting showed discrepancies, and the North stopped allowing the IAEA to inspect its nuclear facilities. \n1994: The U.S.-DPRK Agreed Framework\nIn 1994, the U.S. proposed a new agreement with North Korea, as part of an effort to keep North Korea in the NPT. The countries signed the US-DPRK Agreed Framework, named after the Norths formal name (the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea). Under the agreement, in exchange for U.S.-organized aid and fuel shipments, North Korea committed to stopping its plutonium weapons program, as well as to remaining in the NPT and allowing IAEA inspections. In the agreement, the North also sought formal assurances that the U.S. would not use nuclear weapons against it. \n\nIn 1998, North Korea violated the agreements provisions with a missile test. The U.S. conducted a policy review and recommended additional agreements. A new U.S. administration took office in 2001, before the recommendation was implemented.\nIn October 2001, the U.S. reported that the North violated the agreement by secretly enriching uranium; North Korea denied this. The U.S. then suspended the fuel shipments to the North. The U.S. also failed to complete conditions of the agreement, such as announcing in 2003 that it would stop a project to build light-water reactors, which are used in generating nuclear energy. The conditions of the agreement were never fully realized.\n2002: North Korea-Japan Pyongyang Declaration\nNorth Korea agreed to suspend missile testing in 2003 and afterwards as part of the Japan-DPRK Pyongyang Declaration. Both North Korea and Japan also agreed to adhere to international agreements on nuclear development. The agreement is violated with the Norths withdrawal from the NPT and subsequent missile tests.\n2003 to 2007: The Six-Party Talks\nBetween 2003 and 2007, China, Japan, North Korea, Russia, South Korea and the U.S. held a series of negotiations on denuclearizing the North. The first, second and third talks resulted in various statements, but did not result in any joint agreements among all parties. During the negotiations, North Korea said it would accept a freeze for compensation agreement. \nThen in February 2005, North Korea said it possessed nuclear weapons and would not attend future talks, citing the U.S. Secretary of States comment that North Korea was an outpost of tyranny. After the U.S. changed its lead negotiator, North Korea joined the U.S. for a fourth round of talks later that year. The parties released a Joint Statement of the Fourth Round of the Six-Party Talks that affirmed the Norths commitment to end all nuclear weapons development and to return to the NPT, abiding by IAEA safeguards, in exchange for aid, investment and powerelectricity. A further round of talks in 2007 outlined specific plans and dates for the implementation of the 2005 agreement. \nHowever, in 2009 North Korea launched a missile capable of carrying a nuclear warhead, and the U.N. condemned the actions. The North announced it would not be bound by any agreement reached at the talks.\n2012: The Leap Day Deal\nThe U.S. and North Korea engaged in secret in 2011. Its leader Kim Jong-il died in December 2011 and was replaced by his son Kim Jong-un, who initially agreed to terms agreed to during his fathers leadership. On February 29, 2012, North Korea agreed to the Leap Day Deal, under which it committed to stop long-range missile and nuclear activities in exchange for food aid.\nYet in April, North Korea launched an earth observation satellite in violation of a U.N. resolution, and the U.S. suspended commitments under the Leap Day Deal. Then in May, the North amended its constitution and referred to itself as a nuclear-armed state.\n2018: Panmunjom Declaration\nIn April 2018, North and South Korea committed to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and promised to formally end the Korean War, issuing the Panmunjom Declaration for Peace, Prosperity and Unification of the Korean Peninsula. The document confirmed the common goal of realizing, through complete denuclearization, a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula. The countries agreed to meet again to continue discussions. \nIn July, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un met with U.S. President Donald Trump at a summit, and they released a joint statement. It included that the North reaffirmed its commitment to the Panmunjom Declaration and the firm and unwavering commitment to complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. \nIn September, after a meeting with South Korea, North Korea agreed to permanently shut down an engine test site and missile launch pad in Dongchang-ri and to permanently dismantle the Yongbyon nuclear facility contingent upon corresponding measures by the U.S., without stating what the measures needed to be. \n\nSources: 1992 Declaration, Arms Control Organization, Arms Control Organization, CFR, CRS - Nuclear Negotiations, IAEA Safeguards, IEER, International Peace Institute, Japan Foreign Ministry, KCNA, NPT, NTI, TIME, The Conversation, UN Press, US-DPRK Framework, US State Department, White House",

About 49 percent felt their data was less secure at the time of the January 2017 survey than it had been five years prior.\nWhile consumers voice concerns about data privacy, some dont take steps to protect themselves from theft:\n\n\t57 percent of people surveyed fail to read, or only skim, privacy policies on entering websites, according to a 2016 KPMG study.\n\t55 percent of people surveyed said they were willing to share some information about myself with companies in order to use online services for free, according to a 2014 Pew Research Center study.\n\t33 percent of people surveyed said they were aware they could read online privacy policies, and 16 percent said they had done this, according to a 2016 TRUSTe/National Cyber Security Alliance study.\n\nIf you want to protect your data, Consumer Reports provides the following tips to secure your information:\n\n\tDont give out your social security number to unknown people or organizations who ask for it via phone, email or other correspondences.\n\tDont carry your Social Security card with you.\n\tDon't write your Social Security number on checks.\n\tStore financial account statements, medical records, and tax filings in a secure place.\n\tDon't post your birthdate, mother's maiden name, first pet's name, or other personal information on social media sites. That type of information may be used for verification purposes or security questions.\n\tIf available, sign up for any mobile alert features your bank or credit card offers, which can inform you of any suspicious activity, allowing you to act and contest the issue as it happens.\n\tFreeze access to your credit report from credit bureaus such as Equifax (depending on the credit agency, this may cost various fees) to prevent someone from opening any new lines of credit in your name. Once this is done, only financial institutions that you already have a relationship with, such as your mortgage company, can access the report information. You must request a freeze from each reporting bureau individually.\n\n\tAs noted by Forbes contributor Marc Weber Tobias, unfreezing your account may take several days and have associated fees, which may need to be taken into consideration if you need to take out a line of credit, for example.\n\n\n\tA 90-day fraud alert can be placed on accounts that you suspect have been compromised or illegally accessed.\n\tUse strong passwords, as outlined by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (see Appendix A) and the Electronic Frontier Foundation. According to the aforementioned Pew Research survey, 25 percent of respondents said they use passwords that are less secure than theyd like because theyre easier to remember.\n\n\tFun fact: avoid using the password Trustno1. Formerly used by Fox Mulder in the TV show X-Files, it is now considered to be one of the 25 most popular passwords, according to a report from the password management service SplashData.\n\n\n\tMonitor your financial account activity on a regular basis. This may involve seeking out credit reports maintained by companies such as Equifax, and keeping records of your own financial transactions, as well as those you suspect are the result of fraud.\n\tStop unwanted credit card requests. If you receive a credit card application in the mail, people may steal these forms and fill them out without your knowledge. Consumer Reports says you can stop credit bureaus from selling your name to lenders by going to optoutprescreen.com or calling 888-567-8688. The website lets you opt out for five years or life.\n\nIf you suspect you are being affected by identity theft, Consumer Reports recommends a number of steps, including letting your financial institutions know as soon as possible, closing compromised accounts and using the freezing and fraud alert tools previously noted.\nInformation on credit bureaus\nCredit bureaus collect information such as a persons bill payment and borrowing history in order to calculate a credit score. Credit scores are used by lenders, insurers and employers to assess how people handle financial responsibilities. For example, a bank may use your credit score to decide whether to give you a loan and what interest rate you will pay on it. Other information collected includes Social Security numbers, address history and birthdays.\nCredit bureaus get their information from banks, credit card issuers and other creditors. They also collect public information such as court or property records.\nThere are three main credit bureaus: Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion, though there are other credit reporting companies, such as Payment Reporting Builds Credit (PRBC), Clarity Services Inc. and DataX.\n Equifax",

Eighty-one percent of the 5.3 million eligible voters turned out to elect a new parliament. Three pro-independence parties, Together for Catalonia, Republican Left of Catalonia and Popular Unity, were projected to win 48 percent of the vote, 70 seats in total, giving pro-independence parties a majority of the 135 total seats. \nProjections were based on 95 percent of the votes counted. The Citizens (Cs) party, which supports Catalonia remaining as a semi-autonomous region of Spain, was projected to win the most votes of any single party: 25 percent, and 36 seats. Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoys Popular Party was projected to win three seats, fewer than the 11 it won in 2015. Together for Catalonia won the second-most votes.\nCarles Puigdemont, former Catalan president and member of the Together for Catalonia party was in Brussels, Belgium, during the vote, along with four of his ministers. They left Spain in October. Spain issued a warrant for his and his associates arrest on charges of rebellion, sedition and misuse of public funds for their role in the October referendum for Catalan independence. The warrant was later dropped. Charges could still be filed against Puigdemont if he returns to Spain. \nAfter the Catalan referendum in October, Puigdemont declared independence from Spain and then suspended the implementation of independence. Rajoy then dissolved Catalonias government and called for a new regional parliament to be elected on Dec. 21.\nSome other members of Catalonias former government, including former-Vice President Oriol Junqueras, are imprisoned in Spain. Junqueras is a member of the Catalan Republican Left that obtained the third-most votes on Thursday.\nSixteen percent of Spains population lives in Catalonia.\nSources: BBC, BBC, The Washington Post",

      "Content": "New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio recently announced the citys plan to divest $5 billion of its pension funds from fossil fuel reserve owner companies. During the mayors press conference, Michael Mulgrew, the president of the United Federation of Teachers (UFT), noted divestments purported role in ending apartheid in South Africa.\nDivesting funds from companies for moral or political reasons is a concept called protest divestment. Below, well explore the concept in the context of South Africa, its perceived effectiveness and some current examples. This framework can help evaluate the effects New York Citys proposed measure may or may not have on oil companies and the use of fossil fuels.\nWhats protest divestment?\nAccording to Investopedia, protest divestment involves selling a large amount of stock or other assets, such as real estate, in an effort to put financial pressure on a corporation or government to force social change.\nHow did it factor into apartheid?\nMedia outlets have used the end of apartheid in South Africa as an example of protest divestment use. Apartheid was a system of legislation in South Africa that, among other things, segregated its population by race, prohibited mixed-race marriages, and required non-whites to carry documents granting them permission to enter certain restricted areas. South Africa had aspects of this system in place between 1950 and 1994, when a new constitution took effect.\nIn the 1980s, college students, religious groups and other public organizations outside South Africa began to call on institutions to divest from companies that did business with the country. Schools such as the University of California, Yale University and Harvard University agreed to divest fully or partially their assets in South Africa, as did companies such as General Motors and IBM.\nEconomists who have studied the issue have concluded that divestment likely did not have a significant role in ending apartheid. Economists Siew Hong Teoh, Ivo Welch and C. Paul Wazzan studied the impact of U.S. divestments on South Africa and found that they had little discernible effect on the valuation of banks and corporations with South African financial markets.\nOther factors, such as Nelson Mandelas anti-apartheid movement, likely contributed more to the eventual end of apartheid. These factors also include sanctions on South Africa from countries such as the U.S., as well as various rights groups that protested and boycotted the South African government for at least four decades. In 1986, the U.S. passed the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act, which encouraged South Africa to release political prisoners, including Mandela, and to establish a timetable for eliminating apartheid laws.\nHow effective is divestment?\nAs noted above, the financial impact of divesting may be minimal. Rebecca Leber of The New Republic wrote that divestment can be a tactic for driving home the message of the broader campaign. According to New Yorker contributor William MacAskill, divestment campaigns may be more effective as a stigmatization tool, rather than a means to financially pressure a large company or industry. MacAskill uses the following example to illustrate this:\nSuppose that the market price for a share in ExxonMobil is ten dollars, and that, as a result of a divestment campaign, a university decides to divest from ExxonMobil, and it sells the shares for nine dollars each. What happens then? Well, what happens is that someone who doesnt have ethical concerns will snap up the bargain. Theyll buy the shares for nine dollars apiece, and then sell them for ten dollars to one of the other thousands of investors who dont share the universitys moral scruples. The market price stays the same; the company loses no money and notices no difference.\nWhat are other examples of divestment campaigns?\nIn addition to divesting to protest apartheid, and oil and gas companies, groups have also used it to protest tobacco, coal and gun companies. Below are a few examples of those campaigns.\nTobacco\nIn the 1980s, members of the American Medical Association requested that the organization divest stocks in tobacco companies, citing the potential inconsistency of a health organization funding tobacco. During that time, medical professionals also campaigned for medical schools to divest. In 1990, Harvard divested $40 million from tobacco companies, and the City University of New York divested about $3.5 million worth of tobacco stock after a board member argued against funding unhealthy tobacco. Around the same time, the Boston-based Tobacco Divestment Project was founded to lobby companies to divest from the tobacco industry.\nDivestment campaigns against the tobacco industry exist today as well. In 2010, the Norwegian government divested about $2.56 billion from tobacco companies for ethical reasons. The Dutch pension fund ABP recently announced plans to divest $4 billion from tobacco companies and nuclear weapons manufacturers. ABP Chairman Erik van Houwelingen said the investments had been a dilemma for some time, and that changes in society contributed to the decision to divest.\nGuns\nIn 2016, the New York City Employees Retirement System voted to divest about $10.5 million in shares from retailers such as Dicks Sporting Goods that sell guns to the public. A public spokesperson said, We will no longer do business with companies that fund the deaths of our family members and friends. In 2013, the Chicago Teachers' Pension Fund board voted to divest $146,000 from two gun companies.\nCelebrities such as Snoop Dogg, Seattle Seahawks linebacker Bobby Wagner and NBA Memphis Grizzlies forward Matt Barnes have also publicly declared their intent to divest from gun companies to protest gun violence.\nCoal\nIn November, The Guardian reported that 15 insurance companies had divested about 15 billion (about $20.3 billion) from the coal industry over the past two years. Johns Hopkins and Columbia universities also recently announced plans to divest. \nColumbia Universitys trustees voted to divest from companies deriving more than 35 percent of their revenue from thermal coal production, and to participate in the Carbon Disclosure Projects Climate Change Program to demonstrate its longstanding commitment to climate change. Trustees of Johns Hopkins, which had divested from tobacco in 1991, said its decision to divest from thermal coal was based on advocacy from student groups who had lobbied for the change for two years. Additionally, the California State Teachers Retirement System board voted to divest from U.S. coal companies last year.\nOil\nNew York Citys isnt the only government looking to divest funds from the oil industry. Norway has proposed selling $35 billion in oil and natural gas stocks; the final decision may not be made until fall 2018, according to Norways Finance Ministry. Our perspective here is to spread the risks for the states wealth, Egil Matsen, the deputy central bank governor overseeing the fund, said in an interview in Oslo. We can do that better by not adding oil-price risk. \nThe Rockefeller Family Fund announced in 2016 that it divested from Exxon and planned to divest from other fossil-fuel companies after it said Exxon had allegedly misled the public about climate change.\nMedia outlets that analyzed the campaigns listed above did not examine whether any of the divestments directly resulted in political or social change.",

      "Content": "On Tuesday, President Donald Trump called Russian President Vladimir Putin and, among other matters discussed, congratulated him on his victory Sunday in the Russian presidential election. The Washington Post reported that there was an unauthorized disclosure to the press of some briefing materials for the call, including the words DO NOT CONGRATULATE, and a recommendation to address the March 4 poisoning of a former Russian spy and his daughter in the U.K. with a Soviet-era nerve agent. The outlet said its sources did not know whether Trump had read the briefing notes prior to the call. \nTrump did not discuss the poisoning attack on the call, according to White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders. The U.K. has alleged that Russia is culpable for the poisoning of former Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury. The U.S., France and Germany agreed with Britains assessment. Russia has denied responsibility. The Skripals remain hospitalized in critical condition.\nOn the call, Trump and Putin reportedly discussed the Syrian conflict, denuclearizing North Korea and mutual national security priorities and challenges. Trump described the conversation as a very good call. He told reporters after the call, Well probably be meeting in the not-too-distant future. Sanders said there was no meeting planned between the two heads of state.\nOn Wednesday, Trump tweeted: I called President Putin of Russia to congratulate him on his election victory (in past, Obama called him also). The Fake News Media is crazed because they wanted me to excoriate him. They are wrong! Getting along with Russia (and others) is a good thing, not a bad thing.......They can help solve problems with North Korea, Syria, Ukraine, ISIS, Iran and even the coming Arms Race. Bush tried to get along, but didnt have the smarts. Obama and Clinton tried, but didnt have the energy or chemistry (remember RESET). PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH!\nAsked at a Tuesday press briefing if the administration believes the Russian election was free and fair, Sanders responded that, were focused on our elections. We dont get to dictate how other countries operate. She added that the administration can only focus on the freeness and fairness of our elections, saying the White House would continue to do everything [it] can to protect to make sure bad actors dont have the opportunity to impact U.S. elections in any way.\nResponse to the briefing note \nSens. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) and Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) called for whoever gave the briefing note to the press to resign. \nSasse reportedly said, A presidents staff shouldnt leak. In cases of principle, you may need to resign. So resign. Do the right and honorable thing if you believe your conscience is compelled to do so and resign your position. \nRubio tweeted, I dont agree with congratulating #Putin but bigger outrage is this leak that could only come from someone in @POTUS inner circle. If you dont like the President resign, but this ongoing pattern of duplicity holds potential for serious damage to the nation.\nSources: Breitbart, Politico, The Atlantic, The Washington Post",

This is not the end of her treatment but marks a significant milestone, said the hospital's deputy chief executive Christine Blanshard. Yulia, 33, left Salisbury District Hospital on Monday and was taken to a secure location, according to BBC. \nSkripals father, Sergei Skripal, remains hospitalized. Although he's recovering more slowly than Yulia we hope he too will be able to leave hospital in due course, Blanshard said.\nLast month, Yulia and her father were taken to the hospital after being found unconscious on a park bench. Remnants of a nerve agent were found on the Skripals front doorknob. British officials also found traces of the chemical at two places the Skripals had visited on the day of the attack. France, Germany, the U.S. and the U.K. assessed that it was highly likely that Russia was responsible for the attack. Russia has denied involvement.\nIn a tweet on Tuesday, the U.K.s Russian embassy released a statement that said, we congratulate Yulia Skripal on her recovery, and asked for urgent proof that she was reportedly moved to a secure location out of her free will.\nBritish scientists have identified the chemical used in the attack as Novichok. According to AFP, the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), an intergovernmental organization, has not yet verified the U.K.s findings.\nIn 2004, Russian authorities arrested Skripal for providing the British intelligence service MI6 with the names of Russian agents. He was sentenced to 13 years in prison in 2006. He was released and moved to the U.K. four years later as part of an exchange for Russian spies arrested by the FBI.\nSources: BBC, AFP",

      "Content": "On Thursday, the guided missile destroyer USS John S. McCain sailed within 12 nautical miles of Mischief Reef, an artificial island built by China, in what the Pentagon calls a freedom of navigation exercise. Twelve nautical miles is an internationally-recognized territorial boundary. Sailing within that boundary shows a country does not recognize a territorial claim, according to Reuters.\nChinas Foreign Ministry responded to the U.S. operation, saying it violated international and Chinese law, and that China is very displeased with this and will bring up the issue with the U.S. side. \nMischief Reef is one of seven artificial islands built by China in the Spratly Islands archipelago. Three of these have runways and military installations. Chinas territorial claims in the area have been disputed by Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam. About $5 trillion in trade passes through the South China Sea each year.\nSources: Reuters, Fox News",

      "Content": "Ohio resident Lucille Holt-Colden posted a video online via Facebook Live Stream last week showing police responding to a call about children mowing the wrong lawn. Holt-Colden had hired 12-year-old Reginald (Reggie) Fields, who runs Mr. Reggies Lawn Cutting Service, to mow her yard in Maple Heights, a suburb of Cleveland.\n\nReggie said later he didnt realize his team, made up of himself, his sister and two cousins, was partly mowing neighbor Linda Krakoras lawn. The police did not stop or give any citations to the children. \nKrakora said she and her husband called the police about Holt-Colden, not the children, because we cant talk to her [Holt-Colden]. Both Krakora and Holt-Colden spoke critically about having the other as a neighbor. According to Holt-Colden, Krakora has phoned the police about incidents she or her family had done at least five times since she moved in last October.\nWhen Maple Heights police arrived at the house, they spoke to the adults only and no action was taken against the children, Lt. Joe Mocsiran said. Mocsiran also said that in the neighborhood where the incident took place, it was difficult to tell where the beginning and end of each persons lawn was. \nHolt-Colden, Reggie and his lawn mowing team are black, and Krakora is white. Holt-Colden alleged that Krakora would not have called the police if the children were white. Krakora, who has lived in her house for more than 30 years, said, I dont have an issue with color or I would have moved years ago. Holt-Colden said there are people from a variety of races who live in the neighborhood.\nHolt-Colden posted her video online with the caption This is RIDICULOUS!!! As of Monday afternoon, the video had more than 500,000 views. Holt-Colden also started a GoFundMe page for Reggie and by Saturday afternoon, the campaign had raised more than $41,000. Others have donated landscaping equipment to Reggie. \nReggies mother said his customers have increased after the incident. Reggie, who will be starting seventh grade, plans to buy rakes and shovels to continue his business in the fall and winter, CNN reported. \nSources: CNN, Fox News, GoFundMe, The New York Times, The Washington Post",

If they fail to do so, they could be incarcerated, starting in April. The notice exempts children, elderly people and victims of slavery and human trafficking. According to media reports, many of the migrants say they have come to Israel to seek asylum from conflict and persecution in their home countries.\nAccording to the PIA, there are 38,000 Africans in Israel, mainly from Sudan and Eritrea, who did not enter the country through an official border crossing. Of these people, 1,420 are being held in detention centers. Israeli news outlet Haaretz reported that the majority of the migrants have temporary visas that need to be renewed every three months. The next time they expire, authorities will renew them one final time and visa holders will be required to leave before their visa expires.\nIsrael stated that migrants who leave before the end of March will be given $3,500 and airfare. The PIA said they have the option of returning to their home country or a third country, with Rwanda or Uganda being proposed destinations.\nThe United Nations refugee agency said the PIAs notice violates international and Israeli laws.

      "Content": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Monday he had documents showing Iran lied when it said it did not have a nuclear weapons program. Netanyahu said Iran intensified efforts to hide nuclear weapons files after signing a 2015 agreement to limit its nuclear program in exchange for the removal of sanctions. \nNetanyahu made his announcement in English at Israel's defense ministry in Tel Aviv. He said Israel had obtained 183 CDs containing 55,000 files and 55,000 pages of documents that had been kept in vaults in Irans capital city of Tehran. During his announcement, Netanyahu showed what he described as exact copies of some of the documents, blueprints, photos and videos that he alleged were incriminating. Netanyahu said the files had been shared with the U.S. and would be shared with the International Atomic Energy Agency.\nIn 2007, a U.S. Director of National Intelligence report estimate judged with high confidence that Iran had a nuclear weapons development program until 2003. The report determined with moderate confidence that Iran had not restarted its nuclear weapons program as of mid-2007.\nIranian and US response\nIranian Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said Netanyahus allegation was ridiculous. \nBefore Netanyahus announcement, Irans Foreign Minister Javad Zarif posted on Twitter, saying, The boy who can't stop crying wolf is at it again. Undeterred by cartoon fiasco at UNGA, an acronym referring to the United Nations General Assembly. The message accompanied a photo of what appeared to be a diagram Netanyahu presented before the U.N. General Assembly in 2012, when he argued that Iran's nuclear enrichment program must be stopped to prevent it from obtaining nuclear weapons. \nU.S. President Donald Trump said the allegation showed that he was 100% right to criticize the 2015 nuclear deal, saying it was not acceptable that part of the agreement will expire in seven years. Trump has set a May 12 deadline to decide whether to either continue to uphold the agreement and waive sanctions against Iran, renegotiate and fix the agreement, or withdraw from it. \nIn October of last year, Trump allowed a deadline to pass without recertifying Irans compliance with the deal. Later that month, the U.S. House of Representatives voted in favor of new sanctions on Iran in response to its ballistic missile program. \nThe nuclear deal\nThe nuclear agreement, officially called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), was put in place in 2015 after 18 months of negotiations. Iran and six other nations signed it: the U.S., Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany. \nThe agreement required Iran to give up about 98 percent of its enriched uranium, prohibited the country from producing nuclear weapons, and required it to allow nuclear inspections. \nSome requirements of the deal, such as limits on its uranium stores, are scheduled to expire between 2025 and 2031 under various sunset clauses (or scheduled termination of certain provisions). In exchange for agreeing to the restrictions, the U.S., European Union and other members of the United Nations lifted some sanctions on oil and other products from Iran. \nMore background information on JCPOA available here. \nSources: BBC, CNN, Israel Foreign Ministry, US DNI Report, State Department",

      "Content": "A male shooter killed at least five people and injured two others at the Capital Gazette newspaper in Annapolis, Maryland, on Thursday. Anne Arundel County police said only one suspect was involved and that he was in custody. The shooting occurred around 2:40 p.m. local time. Police evacuated the building, sending people to a nearby mall while authorities searched the premises. \nPolice identified the suspect as a 38-year old Laurel, Maryland, resident. They said he used a shotgun and smoke grenades. Authorities charged the suspect with five counts of first-degree murder.\nThe suspect had lost a defamation case against a columnist and an editor for the Gazette in 2015, according to the Baltimore Sun. He had alleged the paper had defamed him in a 2011 column it ran that covered his guilty plea for criminal harassment of a woman via social media. Neither the columnist nor the editor in that case were present during the shooting, and they are no longer employed by the paper.\nAnne Arundel County Deputy Police Chief William Krampf said, This was a targeted attack on the Capital Gazette. This person was prepared today to come in. He was prepared to shoot people. Police said about 170 people were in the building at the time of the shooting. The Anne Arundel County executive said police found the gunman hiding beneath a desk in the newsroom.\nPhil Davis, a courts and crime reporter for the Capital Gazette, tweeted, Gunman shot through the glass door to the office and opened fire on multiple employees.\nDavis also tweeted, There is nothing more terrifying than hearing multiple people get shot while you're under your desk and then hear the gunman reload. He later tweeted, I was not tweeting from under my desk. I was already safe when I started tweeting.\nMaryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) tweeted, Absolutely devastated to learn of this tragedy in Annapolis. He added, Please, heed all warnings and stay away from the area. Praying for those at the scene and for our community.\nThe FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) were reportedly on the scene investigating. ATF can aid in tracing weapons, according to The Baltimore Sun, which owns the Capital Gazette. The Sun reported that police were on the scene within a minute of being called, and that police were sent to its site in Baltimore as a precaution. \nSources: The Baltimore Sun, The Washington Post",

Breitbart said it and Bannon, who served as White House Chief Strategist until mid-August, had cut all ties with Nehlen after he made a series of anti-Semitic and pro-white supremacist comments on Twitter. Nehlen was a contributor to Breitbart, and the media outlet says it has removed his contributor page from its website.\n \n On Tuesday, Nehlen tweeted that he was currently reading Kevin MacDonalds book, The Culture of Critique: An Evolutionary Analysis of Jewish Involvement in Twentieth-Century Intellectual and Political Movements. According to Newsweek, the book blames Jews for anti-Semitic resentment.\nEarlier this month, Nehlen appeared on the podcast Fash the Nation, which CNN describes as a white nationalist podcast. On Twitter, Nehlen has used the hashtag #ItsOkayToBeWhite and called someone a (((bigot))) using echoes or three parentheses to identify a person as Jewish. \nWhen reached for comment, Nehlen told CNN, Putting America First above all other nations, such as being pro-wall and for freedom of lawful speech, has brought a coordinated attack by globalists from both parties; nevertheless I will continue to stand strong against anti-American sentiment, however it manifests. \nNehlen ran against House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) in the 2016 Republican primary for the Wisconsin congressional seat. He lost with 16 percent of the vote to Ryans 84 percent. According to The Guardian, Nehlen is running for the same seat in 2018. Ryan has not announced whether he will run again.\nSources: Breitbart, CNN, Newsweek, The Guardian",

      "Content": "The First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution states: Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances. \n\nThe Constitution didnt define the concept of a free press, which ultimately lead to courts and Congress establishing a definition through law and legal precedent. The judiciary, for instance, also later ruled that government institutions other than Congress, including local police departments, could not prohibit free press or speech. Nonetheless, the judiciary continues to review cases that test the boundaries of a free press and the possible limitations of that freedom.\n\nShould press and speech be restricted?\n\nThe U.S. court system and Congress say: yes, press and speech freedoms should be restricted in certain ways. This, however, may depend on the court, the type of material the press wants to publish, and the people in power. \nWhat does the U.S. government say about free press and speech?\n\nIn general, the government restricts or attempts to restrict the press and citizens from disseminating information that it considers a threat to national security, though some courts have ruled that security can be a vague term. Below are some examples.\nEspionage Act\n\nThe Espionage Act of 1917, which is still enforced, prohibited people from publishing information relating to national defense that may be used to the injury of the United States, or to the advantage of any foreign nation. Violations may lead to a $10,000 fine and up to 20 years in prison. \n\nFormer CIA analyst Edward Snowden was charged in 2013 with violating the Espionage Act for giving classified communications to the press.\nSchenck v US\nIn Schenck v United States, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled on March 3, 1919, that the freedom of speech could be restricted if the information represented a clear and present danger to society.\n\nIn his ruling, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes said, The most stringent protection of free speech would not protect a man falsely shouting fire in a theater and causing a panicThe question in every case is whether the words used are used in such circumstances and are of such a nature as to create a clear and present danger that they will bring about the substantive evils that Congress has a right to prevent.\nNew York Times Co. v US\nIn 1971, when The New York Times and The Washington Post printed illegally obtained classified documents about the countrys involvement in the Vietnam War, the Supreme Court ruled in the newspapers favor. The court said the press was meant to serve the governed, not the governors, and that only a free and unrestrained press can effectively expose deception in government.\n\nRegarding security concerns for restricting the press, the court said, The word security is a broad, vague generality whose contours should not be invoked to abrogate the fundamental law embodied in the First Amendment.\nThe guarding of military and diplomatic secrets at the expense of informed representative government provides no real security for our Republic, the court continued. The Framers of the First Amendment, fully aware of both the need to defend a new nation and the abuses of the English and Colonial governments, sought to give this new society strength and security by providing that freedom of speech, press, religion, and assembly should not be abridged.\nPolicy on the seizure of materials\nDuring the Obama administration, then Attorney General Eric Holder issued a policy change saying the Department of Justice would prohibit the seizure of materials gathered by a journalist unless the journalist was the focus of a criminal investigation for conduct not connected to ordinary newsgathering activities. Prior to the policy change, the Justice Department could seize certain materials from journalists if the materials were part of an investigation. \nPolicy changes such as Holders can be reversed by the next person to hold that position, and court precedent can be overturned if a case arises that requires the justices to reevaluate a past ruling.\nHas the press go too far?\nA Google search for has the press gone too far yields several blogs and personal reactions from people discussing cases in which they thought the press overreached, in a variety of ways. This issue isnt new. \nPrivacy concerns\nA paper published in 1985 by sociologists Martin Bulmer and Jennifer Bell argued that some forms of journalism violate an individuals right to privacy, such as publishing information about someones private sex life. Others have also noted that the media shouldnt publicize a politicians sex life. \nThe Society of Professional Journalists (SPJ), a U.S.-based journalism organization, may agree with that notion; it suggests journalists balance the publics need for information against potential harm or discomfort, adding, pursuit of the news is not a license for arrogance or undue intrusiveness. \nObjectivity and journalists safety\nFor stories covering police actions or government surveillance, balancing the potential for harm versus the storys public interest may be harder for a journalist to judge. \nFor example, journalists covering political protests have sometimes gotten involved in the action theyre covering. In 2014, Politico published an opinion piece saying that journalists covering demonstrations against police in Ferguson, Missouri, had stopped reporting from a place of objectivity, noting that it may have been impossible for them to do so because they could be pushed, prodded or find themselves on the receiving end of a rubber bullet or tear-gas canister, while covering the polices altercations with protestors. \nNational security versus public interest\nWhen it comes to national security, the U.S. government has said that Snowdens release of classified documents, and their eventual publication by various media outlets did tremendous damage to U.S. national security. A report issued by the U.S. House Intelligence Committee said Snowdens information revealed eight high-risk issues that revealed U.S. defense capabilities, and their publication could put U.S. troops at greater risk in any future conflict. Snowdens actions publicized the U.S. National Security Agencys intelligence gathering activities, which included gathering metadata and phone calls of U.S. citizens. \nIn a 2017 op-ed, British journalist Alan Rusbridger said the information Snowden had released did limited damage to national security and helped to make the public aware of the governments surveillance operations. In 2016, Attorney General Eric Holder told presidential advisor David Axelrod, We can certainly argue about the way in which Snowden did what he did, but I think that he actually performed a public service by raising the debate that we engaged in and by the changes that we made. \nSPJ suggests journalists consider the long-term implications of the extended reach and permanence of publication. Whether the press goes too far in reporting on information may depend on the articles impact over time. \nWhat people have said about the press over the years\nFreedom of the press is sometimes described as a fundamental requirement for a democratic society. For example, the second U.S. president, John Adams, said, The liberty of the press is essential to the security of freedom in a state.\nFormer President Thomas Jefferson is quoted to have said, Were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers, or newspapers without a government, I should not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter.\nSamuel Gompers, a leader of the U.S. labor party in the 19th and early 20th centuries, wrote about freedom of speech and the press. He wrote: We do not need this right to please those entrusted with the authority of government. Free press and free speech were guaranteed that men might feel free to say things that displeased. Demand for reform coming from the people is generally distasteful to those entrenched in power and privilege. We must have the right to freely speak and print for the wrongs that need resistance and cause that needs assistance.\n\nUpon losing his election for governor of California, former President Richard Nixon said, You wont have Nixon to kick around anymore, because, gentlemen, this is my last press conference.  I hope that the press  recognize that they have a right and a responsibility, if theyre against a candidate, give him the shaft, but also recognize if they give him the shaft, put one lonely reporter on the campaign who will report what the candidate says now and then.\nZimbabwean journalist Geoffrey Nyarota said in 2002, As journalists, we are sometimes guilty of not taking cognizance of the enormity of the challenges and the responsibilities that we carry on our shoulders.\nOn this years World Press Freedom Day, held on May 3, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said, The United States values freedom of the press as a key component of democratic governance. By fostering a free press, citizens are more informed, active and engaged in political decision-making, and can better hold their governments accountable.\n\n\nSources: Brenner article on Snowden, Espionage Act, Holder DOJ policy change, House Intelligence Committee, James Rose blog, Jefferson quote - History, John Adams quote, New Yorker, Nixon quote - Pew, Nyarota quote, Politico op-ed, Pompeo statement, Rusbridger op-ed, Samuel Gompers, Schenck v United States, Snowden complaint, Society of Professional Journalists, The New York Times v U.S., The press and privacy",

      "Content": "On Monday, Canadian authorities said that one of the 15 people who were killed in a collision between a tractor-trailer and a bus carrying a junior league hockey team had been misidentified. Ten junior hockey players, aged 16 to 21, and five members of the teams personnel were killed in the Friday accident in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan. Fourteen of the 29 people on board were injured, and three were in critical condition as of Saturday. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) had released the identities on Sunday night. The RCMP are investigating the cause of the crash.\nThe hockey team, the Humboldt Broncos, had been on route to a semifinals playoff game in the town of Nipawin when their bus collided with the tractor-trailer at around 5:00 pm local time on Friday. The bus was near Tisdale, traveling north on Highway 35, while the tractor-trailer was traveling westbound on Highway 335, according to the RCMP. \nThe driver of the tractor-trailer was not injured and is not under criminal investigation, the RCMP said. \n\"Our investigators will be looking at all aspects of this accident to determine what took place,\" RCMP Assistant Commissioner Curtis Zablocki said. \"It's too early to comment on the cause of the collision.\"\nThe RCMP and the Office of the Chief Coroner released the full list of the deceased on Sunday. On Monday, Saskatchewans Ministry of Justice said that the body of Parker Tobin, had been misidentified as Xavier Labelle, who is alive. The ministry said he was misidentified in part because all of the players had dyed blond hair for the playoffs and similar builds. A ministry spokesperson said the Office of the Chief Coroner apologized for the mistake.\nThe deceased are as follows:\nPlayers\nAdam Herold, 16\nConner Lukan, 21\nEvan Thomas, 18\nJacob Leicht, 19\nJaxon Joseph, 20\nLogan Boulet, 21\nLogan Hunter, 18\nLogan Schatz, 20\nParker Tobin, 18\nStephen Wack, 21\n\nSources: AP, CBC, CBC, CNN, USA Today",

      "Content": "Protests in Iran have resulted in at least 21 deaths and 450 arrests as of Jan. 2, CNN reported. The protests started in the city of Mashhad last Thursday after prices on various consumer goods increased. Protesters reportedly chanted slogans against government corruption, foreign policy initiatives and economic issues.\nIn addition to taking place in Tehran, Irans capital, protests have occurred in locations such as Karaj, Qaemshahr, Qazvin, Dorud, Tuyserkan, Khomaini Shahr, Shahinshahr and Izeh. Protesters have attempted to enter police stations and military installations, and attacked a seminary, according to state media.According to The New York Times, people said they would continue protesting; the outlet did not elaborate.\nOn Monday, a man with a hunting rifle shot at police, killing one officer and wounding three others in the city of Najaf Abad. CNN reported that a member of the pro-government militia Basij was also killed in south Tehran. At least 12 civilian deaths linked to protest activity during the weekend were also reported Monday, and an additional seven deaths on Tuesday.\nAli Asghar Naserbakht, the deputy governor of Irans Tehran province, told the ILNA news agency on Tuesday that 200 people were arrested on Saturday, 150 people on Sunday and around 100 people on Monday.\nIranian President Hassan Rouhani issued a statement saying, It should be clear to everyone that we are a free nation and, based on the constitution and citizenship rights, people are completely free in expressing criticisms and even their protests, but at the same time, we must pay attention to the way in which criticism and protest should be made to lead to better conditions for the country and people's lives. He also noted that protesters should not allow formation of an atmosphere in which revolution supporters and the people are concerned about their lives and their security.\nWhile discussing the protests at a weekly meeting with family members of martyrs of the 8-year Holy Sacred Defense era, Irans Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei said, The enemies of Iran united by using different tools in their disposition, including money, weapons, politics and intelligence, in order to create problems for the Islamic system.\nWorld leaders such as U.S. President Donald Trump and Israeli President Benjamin Netanyahu spoke in favor of the protests. U.K. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel called for an end to the associated violence.\nOn Sunday, Iran blocked access to Telegram and Instagram social media apps; the media hasnt reported on whether the apps have since become available. The Times noted that users can download software to circumvent government filters.\nIssues protested\nProtesters have cited several issues ranging from alleged government corruption and foreign policy initiatives, to various economic concerns. According to The Washington Post, some protesters chanted, Leave Syria, think about us, a response to Irans financial and military support of the Syrian government and its allies. The following are details on two of the economic concerns protesters have voiced: inflation and unemployment.\nPrice increases\nInflation is a sustained increase in the general level of prices for goods and services in a country. If prices on consumer goods increase overtime, so does the inflation rate.\nIrans current inflation rate varies slightly by source. For example, the Central Bank of the Islamic Republic of Iran puts the current inflation rate at 8.6 percent, which means the average price for consumer goods has increased at an annual rate of 8.6 percent. Other sources place the rate between 9.6 and 10.5 percent. In general, Irans inflation rate for 2017 has fluctuated about two percentage points above and below 10 percent. According to TradeEconomics.com, the rate reached an all-time high of 59.02 percent in May 1995 and a record low of -3.27 percent in April 1958.\nUnemployment\nThe countrys 2017 unemployment rate ranges between 12.4 and 12.7 percent. Statista.com notes that Irans unemployment rate has stayed above 10 percent for a decade, reaching a high of 14 percent in 2014. The youth unemployment rate was estimated to be about 29.2 percent in the first quarter of 2017.\nAdditional source: CNN",

He was running in Mexicos general election scheduled for July 1.\nA group of federal agents from the Deputy Office of Public Security had traveled to Ocampo, Michoacn, on Saturday to detain the public security secretary, Oscar Gonzlez Garca, whom prosecutors accused of involvement in Jurezs murder.

      "Content": "Georgias election board voted on Friday to not close seven of nine polling places in Randolph County ahead of November's midterm elections, after a recommendation in favor of the closures received criticism in the media and by advocacy groups. A consultant hired by the Board of Elections had said the proposed closures would save the county money, while advocacy groups said they could reduce the ability for minorities to vote. \nThe vote was unanimously cast by the countys two election board members: Michele Graham and Scott Peavy.\nThe original proposal to close polling stations resulted from consultant Mike Malone recommendation to close them, when he reportedly said that closing the polling stations would save the county money. Malone also noted that some of the polling stations he suggested for closure did not comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act. \nMalone was hired by the Board of Elections earlier this year after the boards election supervisor quit. Peavy said Malone came highly recommended by Secretary of State Brian Kemp's office. Kemps office and his campaign say the offices elections director had recommended several candidates for the consultant position, the Associated Press reported, not just Malone. \nKemp, a Republican, is running for governor against Stacey Abrams, a Democrat. Abrams is also the first black woman to win a major party gubernatorial nomination and the first woman to run for governor in the state of Georgia, according to Ballotpedia.\nThe Board of Elections terminated Malones contract on Wednesday. \nAdvocacy groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) suggested that polling closures could reduce the ability for minorities in the county to vote. On Thursday, the ACLU tweeted a petition asking people to sign if they wanted Peavy to keep the polling stations open. The same day, the CBC also sent a letter to Peavy asking him not the close them. \nIn a county where the median salary is slightly over $30,000 and more than 60 percent African American, this plan appears to be a deliberate effort to disenfranchise an emerging and engaged demographic, the CBC wrote. Alluding to the Democratic candidate Abrams, the CBC added, In light of the impending historic gubernatorial election in November, we are deeply concerned that the bedrock tenets of democracy would be under attack should this proposal be adopted and implemented.\nToday, the Board of Elections, who are empowered to make these decisions, finally did the right thing and rejected this ill-advised, poorly timed proposal from an independent consultant who is not backed by the Secretary of States office, Kemp said in an email to the Associated Press.\nIn a Facebook post, Abrams attributed the boards vote to local activists who organized, collected signatures, and petitioned their elected leaders. \n\nSources: Abrams Facebook, ACLU Twitter, AP, Ballotpedia, CBC, CNN",

If it does, both chambers of Congress would then have to reconcile the bills before the legislation would be sent to the president for his signature.\nThe Senate has its own version of a tax reform bill. In its current form, it would remove a requirement of the Affordable Care Act, also called Obamacare, that requires individuals to purchase health insurance or be subject to a financial penalty. The House version does not contain that provision.\nThe 440-page House bill, which was first introduced Nov. 2, includes provisions to: \n\n\treduce the corporate tax rate from 35 to 20 percent.\n\treduce the number of individual tax brackets from seven to four.\n\trepeal the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT), which currently sets a minimum payable tax to higher income people by limiting deductions.\n\trepeal the electric car tax incentive.\n\teliminate personal exemptions of $4,050.\n\tincrease the standard individual deduction from $6,350 to $12,000.

      "Content": "A federal judge in California denied the U.S. Department of Justices (DOJ) request to amend the Flores settlement to allow immigrant children to be detained for more than 20 days, including with their families. The ruling on Monday upheld a 2016 court interpretation of the settlement, which said the government could not detain immigrant children for more than 20 days. U.S. District Court Judge Dolly Gee said the DOJs request was \"wholly without merit,\" adding that nothing prevents the Trump administration from reconsidering its current blanket policy of family detention and reinstating prosecutorial discretion.\n\nProsecutorial discretion differs from the Trump administrations zero-tolerance policy, which initially called for all adults found illegally crossing the border to be charged with federal crimes. Changing the policy could allow some families to be released on bond until the immigrant adults court date. \nThe Trump administration implemented its zero-tolerance policy in May, leading to more than 2,000 children being separated from illegal immigrant adults. On June 20, President Donald Trump signed an executive order requesting that the attorney general seek amendment of the 1997 Flores settlement in court so the government could detain alien families together throughout the pendency of criminal proceedings for improper entry or any removal or other immigration proceedings. \nThe DOJ also requested that the Flores settlement be amended regarding the types of licensed facilities in which children could be held.\nGee, the judge, said the DOJs request was effectively seeking to light a match to the Flores settlement. \"It is apparent that [the DOJs request] is a cynical attempt . . . to shift responsibility to the Judiciary for over 20 years of Congressional inaction and ill-considered Executive action that have led to the current stalemate, she wrote. \nGee also ruled against the government in 2015 when the Department of Homeland Security under the Obama administration argued that detaining all illegal immigrant families could act as a deterrent against illegal immigration. In the filing it submitted last month, the DOJ made reference to the previous administrations arguments. In her ruling, Gee responded, As it did before, the Court finds Defendants logic dubious and unconvincing.\nDOJ spokesman Devin O'Malley said Monday that department attorneys were reviewing the decision. \n\"We disagree with the court's ruling declining to amend the Flores [settlement] to recognize the current crisis of families making the dangerous and unlawful journey across our southern border, OMalley said. He added that the court does appear to acknowledge that parents who cross the border will not be released and must choose between remaining in family custody with their children pending immigration proceedings or requesting separation from their children so the child may be placed with a sponsor.\nOn June 26, another California court ruled that the government must reunite children under the age of five with their parents by Tuesday, and older children by July 26. On Monday, the government said about 40 of the approximately 100 children under five years old in its custody would not be reunited with their parents by the Tuesday deadline. It said the children had either not yet been matched with their parents, such as through DNA testing, or the government had not yet determined if the parents were fit to take custody of the children.\nSources: CNN, The Washington Post 1, The Washington Post 2, U.S. Justice Department",

Ivanovi, 64, was the leader of the Freedom, Democracy, Justice Party and was scheduled to attend talks in Brussels between Kosovo and Serbian delegates starting on Tuesday.

Serbia, Russia and some EU countries do not recognize Kosovos independence and Kosovo is not a member of the United Nations.\nIn 2016, a panel of international judges convicted Ivanovi of war crimes for his actions during the Kosovo war.

      "Content": "Florida enacted new gun control measures on Friday when Governor Rick Scott signed Senate Bill 7026 into law. The measures include: raising the legal age for purchasing guns from 18 to 21; banning the import, sale, transfer or possession of bump fire stocks; and prohibiting people deemed mentally defective or those who have been \"committed to a mental institution\" from purchasing or owning a gun \"until certain relief is obtained\" through a petition to the Department of Law Enforcement.\n \n  The law is called the \"Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Act,\" named after the shooting at the school of the same name last month that killed 17 people. Scott said, Every student in Florida has a right to learn in a safe environment and the legislation will help us achieve that. \nThe National Rifle Association (NRA) filed a lawsuit against the state of Florida, alleging the age minimum imposed by the new law violates the second and 14th amendments of the U.S. Constitution. Chris Cox, the executive director of the NRA Institute for Legislative Action said, \"Securing our schools and protecting the constitutional rights of Americans are not mutually exclusive.\"\nOther changes required by the new law include:\n\n\tFunding a $67 million provision for the Coach Aaron Feis Guardian Program, which would allow sheriffs to arm some teachers and give them authority to act as law enforcement to the extent necessary to prevent or abate an active assailant incident on a school premises. Aaron Feis was a coach at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School who shielded students with his own body and died in the February shooting.\n\tRevising the mandatory waiting period between purchase and delivery of most firearms to three days. Florida previously had a three-day waiting period for handgun purchasers who did not have a concealed weapons permit. \n\tImplementing a suspicious activity reporting tool that allows students and the community to relay information anonymously concerning unsafe, potentially harmful, dangerous, violent, or criminal activities, or the threat of these activities, to appropriate public safety agencies and school officials.\n\tProviding educational programs, mental health treatment and residential services for students with severe emotional disturbance. \n\nRead a brief timeline of federal gun control legislation here.\nSources: CNN, NBC News, Florida Senate Bill 7026, Florida Statute790.065",

      "Content": "Delta Air Lines is considering ending group discounts for any group of a politically divisive nature, according to a statement CEO Ed Bastian released on Friday. Deltas announcement comes almost a week after it rescinded a discount for National Rifle Association (NRA) members traveling to the firearms organizations annual meeting. \nDelta previously said it has more than 2,000 group discount contracts.\nLast Saturday, Delta canceled a one-time discount it had offered to NRA members, saying the discount could have been seen as Delta implicitly endorsing the NRA. That is not the case, the airline said, adding that the decision was made to remain neutral and remove itself from the debate on gun control. The airline also asked to have its logo removed from the NRA website.\nDelta said it supported the Second Amendment and the entire Constitution.\nSome other companies have also ended discounts for NRA members since the Feb. 14 shooting at a Florida high school that killed 17 students and teachers. \nDelta is headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia. The day before Delta announced it would reconsider discounts for politically divisive groups, Georgia's legislature passed a tax bill. The version that passed removed a provision that would have exempted jet fuel from sales tax. That tax exemption would have saved Delta an estimated $40 million in taxes, according to Business Insider. \nDeltas Friday statement said some elected officials in Georgia tied our decision to a pending jet fuel tax exemption, threatening to eliminate it unless we reversed course, and noted that the decision on the NRA discounts was not made for economic gain.\nPrior to passing the tax bill, Georgia's Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle (R) said the measure would not contain the jet fuel exemption if Delta did not reinstate its discount to NRA members. Georgia's Governor Nathan Deal (R) said he would sign the tax reform bill into law without the exemption. \nSources: Business Insider, The Washington Post",

      "Content": "On Wednesday, the U.S. Senate passed a non-binding resolution calling on President Donald Trump to obtain congressional approval prior to using national security concerns as a justification for imposing tariffs on other countries. The Republican-drafted resolution passed 88 to 11, with 11 Republicans voting against the measure. Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 allows the president to invoke national security concerns to impose tariffs.\nTrump invoked national security concerns when implementing 10 percent tariffs on aluminum imports and 25 percent tariffs on steel imports from Canada, Mexico and the EU on June 1.\nThe resolution also directs lawmakers to include language in an unrelated spending bill that is being drafted that would grant Congress more authority to approve tariffs that are based on national security.\nThis is a vote for Congress to assume its rightful role, said Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), who cosponsored the resolution with Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.). \nSen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), who voted for the resolution, said, Let's be clear, this is a rebuke of the President's abuse of trade authority. Can you imagine being Canada and being told your steel and aluminum exports to the United States [are] a national security threat?\nSen. David Perdue (R-Ga.), who voted against the measure, said he did not understand why the Senate continues to try to tie the hands of this President at every turn. We all know that enacting tariffs on all imports is not the goal here. This President is committed to creating a more level playing field for our workers and our companies here at home to compete.\nRecent trade measures with China\nOn Tuesday, the U.S. Office of the Trade Representative (USTR) released a list of Chinese goods, worth about $200 billion, on which the U.S. could introduce 10 percent tariffs. Trump had previously requested the list in case China retaliated against the U.S. for a 25 percent tariff it implemented on $34 billion-worth of Chinese imports. China later did impose retaliatory tariffs on the same amount of U.S. goods. \nU.S. tariffs are being implemented under section 301 of the U.S. Trade Act of 1974, which allows the president to take action against unfair or discriminatory trade practices, or trade agreement violations. A USTR section 301 investigation concluded that the acts, policies, and practices of the Government of China related to technology transfer, intellectual property, and innovation covered in the investigation are unreasonable or discriminatory and burden or restrict U.S. commerce.\nThe USTR provided a list of recommendations, including that the U.S. maintain the tariffs on the $34 billion of Chinese goods that the U.S. imposed on July 6, as well as continue the process to implement tariffs on an additional $16 billion-worth of goods from China. \nThe USTR also recommended the U.S. hold a public comment period on the new list of $200 billion-worth of goods before imposing tariffs on them. The body set a schedule through Aug. 30 for public comments, a hearing on the comments, and submission of post-hearing rebuttal comments.\nThe Chinese Foreign Ministry responded to the proposed U.S. tariffs on Wednesday. A spokesperson, Hua Chunying, said, \"We will take firm and forceful measures, without specifying what those measures may include.\nSources: ABC News, CNN, Government Publishing Office, USA Today, U.S. Trade Representative",

He said he was resigning for the people of Minnesota, and that it had become clear that he could not remain an effective senator for them. \nIf Franken does resign, Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton, a Democrat, would have the option of appointing someone to fill Frankens seat until a special election could be held during the next general election in 2018.\nFranken said in his 12-minute resignation speech that some of the allegations against me are simply not true. Others I remember very differently. Franken did not apologize during the speech. I know in my heart that nothing I have done as a senator  nothing  has brought dishonor on this institution, he said.\nOn Wednesday, Politico reported that an unnamed former congressional aide said Franken had tried to forcibly kiss her in 2006 in a radio studio after a taping of his radio show. On Nov. 16 of this year, broadcaster Leeann Tweeden alleged in a statement that Franken kissed her without her consent in December 2006, when he was a radio host and she was a model. She also released a picture in which Franken appears to be touching her breasts through her clothes and bulletproof vest while she was sleeping. \nThe same day, Franken issued an apology for the picture and some offensive jokes he had made, and asked that an ethics investigation be undertaken. He said he did not remember the skit rehearsal as Tweeden did. \nSince the apology, seven women, two who chose to be identified and five who remained anonymous, alleged that Franken groped them or attempted to forcibly kiss them. This number includes the allegation reported Wednesday by Politico.\nBy the end of the day on Wednesday, more than 20 Democratic senators had called for Frankens resignation. \nFranken is the second Democrat this week to announce he's leaving office. Rep. John Conyers, Jr., (D-Mich.) retired yesterday after he was accused of sexual misconduct.\nSources: CNN, The Washington Post",

Some EU countries use psychological tests to determine whether refugee applicants are telling the truth about their sexual orientation.\nThe ECJ ruling said the psychological tests are only approximate in nature, and that the performance of such a test amounts to a disproportionate interference in the private life of the asylum seeker.\nThursdays ruling relates to a 2015 case between a Nigerian national and the Hungarian Office for Immigration and Citizenship. Same-sex acts are illegal in many African nations, including Nigeria, and the man applied for asylum in Hungary on that basis. The applicant, referred to as F, was denied asylum in Hungary after a psychological test he was given concluded it was not possible to confirm his sexual orientation. \nThe tests included an examination of his personality and three specific personality tests, including a Rorschach inkblot test. The ECJ determined on Thursday that the tests had not given an assessment of the plausibility of his sexual orientation. The ECJ asked a court in Hungary to reconsider Fs application.\nThe ECJ ruling is legally binding in all 28 EU countries, and the Hungarian court cannot appeal the decision. \nSources: BBC, Newsweek",

      "Content": "On Tuesday, China announced a temporary 178.6 percent deposit for Chinese importers to pay on purchases of U.S. sorghum, a grain used in animal feed and to make alcohol. The deposit, scheduled to take effect Wednesday, is part of a preliminary decision to implement so-called anti-dumping tariffs on sorghum, and would cover some of the costs of the potential tariffs if theyre implemented. The deposit could discourage Chinese import of U.S. sorghum, The Washington Post reported.\n\nAlso on Tuesday, China said it would phase out its rule prohibiting foreign automakers from owning more than a 50 percent share in companies making vehicles for sale in the country.\nChina began an investigation on Feb. 4 into sorghum imports from the U.S. According to the Chinese Ministry of Commerce, the volume of U.S. sorghum exports to China was 15 times greater in 2017 than 2013, increasing from 317,000 tons to 4.76 million tons, and the price decreased by 31 percent during that time. The ministrys preliminary ruling said the prices were improperly low, according to CBS News. Wang Hejun, director of the Chinese Ministry of Commerces trade remedy and investigation bureau, said the temporary deposit aims at correcting unfair trade practices.\nAn anti-dumping tariff or duty is applied to a product that a country believes is priced below fair market value and is designed to counter so-called dumping of that product, according to Investopedia. Dumping refers to when companies export a product at a lower price than is normally charged in that market in order to eliminate competitors in the foreign market, Investopedia reports.\nAccording to Index Mundi, over the past ten years, sorghum prices reached a low of $130.98 per metric ton in June 2010 and a high of $302.53 in Aug. 2011. In March 2018, the price per metric ton was $181.10.\nKansas, Texas, Colorado, Oklahoma and South Dakota are the five states that produce the most sorghum in the U.S. \nChange to automaker requirements\nTuesdays announcement included phased changes to a 1994 requirement for automakers. The 1994 rule prohibited foreign automakers from holding more than a 50 percent share in a joint ventures with local companies that make cars for sale in China. The country said it would phase out the types of vehicles subject to the requirement, removing it from: electric cars and plug-in hybrids in 2018, commercial vehicles in 2020, and consumer passenger vehicles in 2022. China currently imposes a 25 percent tariff on imports of some U.S.-made vehicles.\nChinas National Development and Reform Commission also said it would remove foreign ownership limits for shipbuilding and aircraft in 2018, Reuters reported.\nZTE ruling this week \nOn Monday, the U.S. prohibited American companies from selling to Chinese phone maker ZTE Corp, for seven years. The action was part of a determination by the U.S. Commerce Department that ZTE violated a civil and criminal penalty agreement with the U.S. for illegally shipping U.S. goods to Iran, making false statements and obstructing justice. ZTE agreed to dismiss four employees and discipline 35 more through bonus reductions or reprimands. ZTE also agreed to pay $890 million in fines and penalties and to pay another $300 million if it violated the agreement. In March, ZTE said it had fired the four employees and had not disciplined the 35 others. \nIn its announcement of the action against ZTE, the U.S. Commerce Department said, This is a regulatory action and is unrelated to any ongoing trade-related actions.\nAbout 25 to 30 percent of ZTEs equipment, including phones and telecommunications networks, comes from the U.S., according to Reuters. ZTE has sold phones to U.S. mobile service providers AT China was not exempted.\nIn March, China announced about $3 billion of tariffs on imports of 128 U.S. goods. In April, the U.S. proposed about $50 billion in potential tariffs on 1,300 categories of Chinese imports.\nSources: CBS News, Reuters, Reuters, The Washington Post, Investopedia",

The list includes some electronics, batteries, phones, furniture, aircraft parts and machinery. The USTR set a 30-day period to receive comments from businesses on the proposed tariffs. \n\nOn Wednesday, China responded by saying it would impose tariffs totaling $50 billion on U.S. imports in response to new U.S. tariffs. China proposed tariffs on imports of 106 products from the U.S., including soybeans, cars and airplanes. \nOn Tuesday, the Chinese Embassy in the U.S. said, Such unilateralistic and protectionist action has gravely violated fundamental principles and values of the W.T.O. [World Trade Organization]. It added, It serves neither Chinas interest, nor U.S. interest, even less the interest of the global economy. U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizers office said the U.S. proposed tariffs were in response to Chinas unfair trade practices related to the forced transfer of U.S. technology and intellectual property.\nOn March 22, Trump instructed the USTR to propose tariffs on China totaling about $60 billion. The USTR said the total value of imports subject to the tariff increase is commensurate with an economic analysis of the harm caused by Chinas unreasonable technology transfer policies to the U.S. economy. According to a USTR report, the Chinese government uses its administrative licensing and approvals processes to force technology transfer in exchange for the numerous administrative approvals needed to establish and operate a business in China.\nThe USTR used algorithms to make its list of proposed tariffs, considering whether the technology used to make products may have been acquired from the U.S. by Chinese companies as a result of Chinese government policies, such as its Made in China 2025 program. The USTR also considered how much of a negative effect the tariff might have on the U.S. economy, The Washington Post reported. Lighthizer said his office chose the items on the list to achieve the lowest consumer impact; toys and clothing were excluded. Some machinery used to make clothing and shoes may be impacted by the proposed tariffs, according to Rick Helfenbein, CEO of the American Apparel and Footwear Association. Made in China 2025 has a goal for China of raising domestic content of core components and materials to 40% by 2020 and 70% by 2025, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\nPresident Donald Trump tweeted on Wednesday that we are not in a trade war with China, and we have a Trade Deficit of $500 Billion a year with China, with Intellectual Property Theft of another $300 Billion. We cannot let this continue! In a separate tweet he said, When youre already $500 Billion DOWN, you cant lose!\nIn 2016, the U.S. had a trade deficit in goods with China of $347 billion, a 5.5 percent increase ($20.2 billion) over 2015, according to the USTR. The deficit in goods and services was $309 billion. In 2016, the U.S. exported $115.6 billion of goods to China, and exports to China accounted for 8 percent of all U.S. exports in 2016. U.S. exports of soybeans totaled $12.4 billion last year, according to the U.S. Agriculture Department.\nOn March 1, Trump announced a separate plan to place tariffs of 10 percent on aluminum and 25 percent on steel imports, and later the U.S. exempted some countries from one or both of these. China was not one of those countries. China responded by imposing tariffs of about $3 billion on imports of 128 categories of American products. Those tariffs went into effect on Monday.\nSources: The New York Times, The Washington Post1, The Washington Post2",

Speaking at a meeting of the National Space Council, Trump said, we are going to have the Air Force and we are going to have the Space Force. Separate, but equal.\nThe president did not discuss what specifically the Space Force would do, its military role or who would lead it. Pentagon spokeswoman Dana White said its Policy Board would begin working on this issue in a deliberate process with a great deal of input from multiple stakeholders. \nThe five current branches of the military are the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps and Coast Guard. Adding a sixth branch would require congressional approval. \nTrump also signed the Space Policy Directive  3 on Monday, which directed the U.S. to lead the management of traffic and mitigate the effects of debris in space. The military is currently tracking about 23,000 objects in space, according to CNBC. The directive also included guidelines for the design and operation of satellites. \nLast December, Trump signed Space Policy Directive  1, which instructed NASA to return U.S. astronauts to the moon, followed by human missions to Mars. In May, he signed Space Policy Directive  2 to reform United States commercial space regulatory framework, seeking to ensure our place as a leader in space commerce. \nVice President Mike Pence, who is the head of the National Space Council, NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine, former astronaut Buzz Aldrin and other council members attended Trumps announcement. \nSources: White House Statement, CNBC, Fox News, The New York Times",

State television said the measure to limit access to social media and messaging apps was to maintain peace, according to The New York Times. Sunday was the fourth day of protests in Iran against rising food and gasoline prices, according to CNN.\nTelegram CEO Pavel Durov tweeted on Sunday, Iranian authorities are blocking access to Telegram for the majority of Iranians after the company refused to shut down some peacefully protesting channels. The day before, Durov tweeted that Telegram suspended one channel, amadnews, as it instructed people to use Molotov cocktails against police, violating Telegrams no calls for violence rule.\nAccording to Al Jazeera, some Iranian Telegram users said on Sunday they could not access the messaging app through cell phone service, but that they could through wifi and home internet connections. CNN reported it was able to contact some Telegram users in Iran through the app, adding that service appeared to be slower than usual.\nBBC reported that protests began on Thursday in Masshad, Irans second-largest city, against economic hardship and rising prices. Protests continued through Sunday, including Saturday protests at Tehran University, Fars news agency reported.\nMehr, which Al Jazeera described as a semi-official Iranian news agency, reported that a government official said 80 people were detained in Arak on Saturday. Mehr also reported that two protesters died in Dorud on Saturday. Habibollah Khojastepour,Lorestan province's deputy for political and security affairs, did not provide a reason for the deaths, saying police and security forces had not fired at protesters.\nAccording to the Times, witnesses said some groups of protesters have chanted death to the dictator and clerics should get lost, supposed references to Irans supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.\nIranian Interior Minister Rahmani Fazli said regarding the protests, those who destroy public properties, create chaos, lawlessness and insecurity in our society, will be held legally responsible and must answer for their behaviors.\nIranian President Hassan Rouhani said, the people are free to express their criticism and their protest, and that protests should be towards a betterment of the conditions for the country.\nSources: Al Jazeera, CNN, The New York Times",

Kennedy said it was \"the greatest honor and privilege to serve our nation in the federal judiciary for 43 years, 30 of those years in the Supreme Court.\" \n \n President Donald Trump called Kennedy a great justice and said he would immediately begin a search for a replacement, who would be subject to senatorial approval. Trump said his choice of nominee would come from a previously released list of 25 candidates. \nKennedy was educated at Stanford and Harvard Law School and served on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in the western U.S. before then-President Ronald Reagan appointed him to the Supreme Court in 1987. He was sworn in the following year.\nIn a letter to the president announcing his retirement, Kennedy said, \"For a member of the legal profession, it is the highest of honors to serve on this Court. Please permit me by this letter to express my profound gratitude for having had the privilege to seek in each case how best to know, interpret and defend the Constitution and the laws that must always conform to its mandates and promises.\nThe Senate will have to confirm any nominee that Trump proposes by a majority vote. Previously, the Senate changed the rules for Justice Neil Gorsuchs appointment to disallow a possible filibuster, which would have required 60 votes, and thus some Democratic ones, to end debate and call a nomination confirmation to a vote. On Wednesday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said the Senate would vote to confirm Kennedy's successor in the fall.\nThere are currently five Supreme Court justices who were appointed by Republican presidents and four appointed by Democratic presidents. That make-up would not change if Trump appoints a nominee who is confirmed.\nSources: CNBC, Fox News",

      "Content": "Israeli forces killed three protesters and injured about 880 along the border with Gaza on Friday during the fifth week of ongoing Palestinian demonstrations, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. The ministry said the three people who died had been shot in the head, and that 174 others were injured with live ammunition and 58 by munition fragments. Israel has said its forces have operated in accordance with the rules of engagement to protect its border. \nThe United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs reported earlier this week that 42 Palestinians had been killed and 5,511 wounded since protests began on March 30. The wounded have been treated for injuries resulting from live fire, coated bullets, tear gas inhalation and other injuries. More than 3,350 have been treated in hospitals and the remainder in the field. \nIsraeli military said between 12,000 and 14,000 Palestinians participated in Fridays protests in five locations along the 40-mile (65-km) Israeli-Gaza border. Demonstrators reportedly pulled down Israeli defensive structures using wire cutters and metal hooks, The New York Times reported, and others have approached the border fence in attempts to cross. \nThere were conflicting accounts of how Fridays casualties occurred. Some witnesses cited by the New York Times said two Palestinians neared the border fence and shot at Israeli soldiers with handguns, and the soldiers threw a hand grenade in response. Other witnessed cited by the outlet said the Palestinians who approached the fence did not fire on the soldiers. \nIsraeli Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus said soldiers used live fire on Friday when 20 to 30 demonstrators made what he called a serious attempt to tear down the fence. The Israeli Foreign Ministry did not immediately comment on Fridays deaths.\nThe Israeli military has characterized the demonstrations as riots. Danny Danon, Israels envoy to the U.N. has alleged that Hamas, the political group that controls Gaza and has an armed division, is responsible for the deaths and has used people as human shields. The terrorists are hiding while allowing, even hoping, for their people to die, Danon alleged.\nHamas denied the allegation and described the protests as peaceful, and protest organizers have said the protests are intended to be nonviolent resistance. Hamas also said Dannons comments were an attempt to escape responsibility and to cover up for the execution of unarmed children and people by occupation soldiers.\nU.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Raad al-Hussein said Israel was using excessive force against the demonstrators, calling it deplorable, and saying that the number of injuries from live fire was staggering.\nOn March 31, the U.S. blocked a draft resolution by the U.N. Security Council that called for an investigation into the incidents in which Palestinian protesters had been killed until that point.\nStated goals of the demonstrations\nThe protests, named The March of Return, are calling for Palestinians who left Israeli areas during and around the May 1948 war and their descendants to be granted the right to return to those areas. Israel said it will not allow the right to return.\nPalestinians began demonstrations and sit-ins on the anniversary of Land Day. The protests were originally scheduled to last more than six weeks and end on May 15, known as Nakba Day. Ismail Haniyeh, the head of the Hamas political bureau, said on Wednesday that the protests would continue beyond May 15. The Palestinian people will demonstrate throughout the month of Ramadan to deal with the many challenges facing us, and first of all the peace plan promoted by U.S. President Donald Trump, he said.\nLand Day is held in remembrance of an incident in which Israeli forces fatally shot six Palestinians on March 30, 1976, as the Palestinians were protesting Israeli land seizures. Nakba Day recognizes the approximately 750,000 people who left their homes in the violence leading up to and during the May 1948 war between Israel and neighboring countries. This year, the Islamic period of Ramadan begins on or around May 15 and will last until around June 14. \nOn each Friday, protest organizers have scheduled a theme for the day. This Fridays theme was rebellious youth, Haaretz reported.\nMore than 2 million Palestinians live within the Gaza territories. Israel withdrew troops from the area in 2005, while maintaining control of the land and sea borders, according to Reuters.\nSources: Haaretz, Reuters, The Jerusalem Post, The New York Times",

The cases were reported in Bikoro, and it was the DRC's ninth known outbreak of Ebola since 1976, when the viral disease was first identified.\nEbola virus disease is caused by one of five Ebola viruses. The virus is transmitted to people from wild animals and spreads through human-to-human contact through bodily fluids. Ebola has an incubation period of between two and 21 days. Symptoms include fever, fatigue, muscle and joint pain, headaches, and a sore throat, which is sometimes followed by vomiting, diarrhea, skin lesions, kidney and liver failure, and internal and external bleeding. The disease has an average case fatality rate of about 50 percent, according to CNN.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) said lab tests confirmed the presence of Ebola in two out of five samples collected from patients. \"WHO is working closely with the government of the DRC to rapidly scale up its operations and mobilize health partners, using the model of a successful response to a similar outbreak in 2017,\" it said in a statement.\nThe WHO said it had released $1 million (840,000 euros) from an emergency contingency fund and set up a coordination group, and called on around 50 experts to work with the DRC government and health agencies. It also notified neighboring countries about the new cases.\n\"We will gather more samples, conduct contact tracing, engage the communities with messages on prevention and control, and put in place methods for improving data collection and sharing,\" said Dr. Matshidiso Moeti, the WHO's regional director for Africa.\nThe last Ebola outbreak occurred in 2017 in the DRCs northern Bas Ul province, and was contained due to efforts by the government, the WHO and other partners, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Four people died during the 2017 outbreak in DRC.\nSources: AFP, CNN",

He also met with Jordans King Abdullah, after which he told reporters that theyd had a very frank discussion. Pence said to reporters, friends occasionally have disagreements and we agreed to disagree on the U.S. decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. What we agreed on was the need for all parties to come back to the table, Pence added. \nKing Abdullah described Pences visit as a mission to rebuild trust and confidence in the two-state solution for Israel and Palestine.\nOn Saturday, Pence met with Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi while in Cairo.

The Hatch Act prohibits \"partisan\" political activity by federal employees while on duty. The OSC said Conway violated the act by advocating for and against candidates during interviews in her official capacity. The White House denied this. \n \n The OSC referred the matter to the president for consideration of appropriate disciplinary action.\nConway gave interviews to Fox News' \"Fox  Friends\" introduced Conway as a \"counselor to President Trump\" and she spoke about Doug Jones, who was at the time the Democratic Senate candidate from Alabama. Among other things, she said Jones would be \"a vote against tax cuts, adding that he's weak on crime, weak on borders. He's strong on raising your taxes.\" \nConway also made comments about what Jones was \"for\" and \"against\" on \"New Day\" on Dec. 6. According to the OSC, Conway was given talking points by the White House for the two interviews and did not adhere to those points when mentioning Jones.\nWhite House deputy press secretary Hogan Gidley said Conway did not advocate for or against the election of any particular candidate. He added that she simply expressed the president's position of having people in the House and Senate who support his agenda. \nGidley said Conway's statements showed her intention and desire to comply with the Hatch Act -- as she twice declined to respond to the host's specific invitation to encourage Alabamians to vote for the Republican.\nThe Hatch Act of 1939 prohibits federal employees from engaging in \"political activity\" while \"on duty or in the workplace.\" It falls under the purview of the Office of Special Counsel, which is separate from special counsel Robert Mueller and his investigation of alleged Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. An OSC fact sheet defines political activity as \"any activity directed at the success or failure of a partisan group or candidate in a partisan election.\" The act doesn't apply to the president.\nSources: CNN, OSC, The Washington Post",

The alleged violation occurred when the agency failed to make the necessary notification before spending $43,238.68 to install the privacy booth in the EPA Administrators office. \nSection 710 of the Act says no funds in excess of $5,000 are to be spent to purchase furniture or make improvements in the office without notifying the Committees on Appropriations of the House of Representatives and the Senate. \nThe EPA said the booth was not part of a redecoration and should not be subject to Section 710 of the Act. In December, EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt said the booth was necessary to be able to do his job. \nThe letter states that the GAO recognizes the requirement to protect classified material and the need for employees to have access to a secure telephone line when handling such information in the course of conducting official agency business and explicitly draws no conclusions about whether the installation of the privacy booth was the only, or the best, way for EPA to provide a secure telephone line for the Administrator. \nEPA spokesman Liz Bowman said the agency was addressing GAOs concern and will be sending Congress the necessary information this week.\nSources: GAO Letter, NBC News, The Washington Post",

The votes followed a week of negotiations on four immigration issues: citizenship for undocumented immigrants enrolled in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, funding for a U.S.-Mexican border wall and security, the diversity visa lottery system, and family-based immigration. An immigration proposal must receive 60 votes to pass in the Senate and a majority of support in the House before being signed into law by the president.\nThe first bill that the Senate voted on failed to advance after a 52-47 vote in favor of the measure. The bill, sponsored by Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.), proposed a path to citizenship for DACA recipients and funding for border security, but not for a border wall. It would not end the diversity lottery program or the family-based migration program. \nNext, the senate voted 54-45 in support of a proposal to restrict funding for so called sanctuary cities, introduced by Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Penn.). This legislation would require that state and local law enforcement officials cooperate with federal immigration officials, or the cities could risk losing certain federal funding.\nThird, a bill sponsored by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D.-N.Y.), failed to pass in a 54-45 vote. Sens. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), Susan Collins (R-Maine), and Angus King (I-Maine) had also introduced the bill, CBS News reported. The bill would have given protection to DACA recipients, such as granting qualified recipients conditional, lawful permanent residence. It also called for $25 billion in funding for border security.\nThe final bill the Senate voted on, introduced by Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), failed to pass in a 39 to 60 vote. That bill, endorsed by President Donald Trump, proposed a path to citizenship for DACA recipients, $25 billion for border security, an end to the diversity visa lottery system and an end to sponsoring extended family members for immigration to the U.S.\nSources: CBS News, CBS News, CNN, Senate Records",

Bump fire stocks are devices that allow semi-automatic guns to fire faster.\nTrump also met with law enforcement and school officials from across the country at the White House on Thursday. At the meeting he recommended having some teachers carry concealed weapons and to give them a bonus as an incentive. He said, you cant hire enough security guards to protect schools, and argued that teachers with concealed weapons would deter shooters from entering schools. \nTrump addressed the public after the Feb. 14 shooting, saying at the time that his administration was committed to working with state and local leaders to help secure our schools, and tackle the difficult issue of mental health. \nWhite House spokesman Raj Shah said Trump has not decided whether to request a gun control bill for Congress to consider, or allow members of Congress to draft their own measure.\nOn Wednesday, Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio said hed support a proposal to raise the minimum age to purchase semi-automatic weapons, such as AR-15s, from 18 to 21. He opposed the idea of teachers carrying weapons. \nThe National Rifle Association (NRA) responded on Wednesday to the proposal to raise the minimum age to purchase guns, saying this would limit peoples constitutional right to self-protection. At the Conservative Political Action Conference on Thursday, NRA CEO Wayne La Pierre opposed more restrictions on the law-abiding. He argued that to stop a bad guy with a gun, it takes a good guy with a gun.\nSources: CNN, USA Today",

      "Content": "Ken Livingstone, former Mayor of London and British Member of Parliament (MP), announced Monday he would resign from the Labour party, saying ongoing issues regarding his 2016 suspension from the party were a distraction from the partys goals. Livingstone was suspended and under investigation for anti-Semitism over a comment he made that Adolf Hitler was supporting Zionism in 1932 with a policy that Jews should be moved to Israel. In announcing his resignation, Livingstone said he did not accept an allegation that he was guilty of anti-Semitism, but that he didnt want the disciplinary investigations against him to drag on for months or years. \nThe ongoing issues are a distraction from the key political issue of our time  which is to replace a Tory government, Livingstone said. The Tory government refers to the British Conservative Party, which is the current governing party in the U.K.\nBackground\nLivingstone, a former London mayor, was suspended in April 2016 following comments he made on BBC Radio London. He was speaking about MP Naz Shah, who had posted a image on Facebook that proposed relocating Israel to the U.S. as a solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict. Shah published the post in 2014 prior to winning her seat in parliament, and in 2016 apologized for the post and said it did not reflect her current views. \nLivingstone said Shahs post was completely over the top and rude, but not anti-Semitic. He said, dont confuse anti-Semitism with criticism of the Israeli government policy. \nLivingstone also said, When Hitler won his election in 1932 his policy then was that Jews should be moved to Israel. He was supporting Zionism before he went mad and ended up killing six million Jews. In 1933, Hitlers government made an agreement with a Jewish company, the Haavara Agreement, that allowed Jews to export wealth in the form of German goods, designed to facilitate Jewish emigration to Palestine. The agreement aided 60,000 German Jews' immigration to Palestine between1933 and 1939, according to the Jewish Virtual Library. \"They didn't like each other but they collaborated to [have Jews emigrate],\" Livingstone said about the agreement.\nCritics argue this is not supporting Zionism. Eight years earlier, Hitler wrote in Mein Kampf: the Jews again most slyly dupe the stupid [non-Jews]. They have no thought of building up a Jewish State in Palestine, so that they might perhaps inhabit it, but they only want a central organization of their international world cheating, ... drawn from the seizure of others.\nResponse\nAt the time of Livingstones comments, Labour MP Rachel Reeves said weve got a growing problem of anti-Semitism in the Labour Party, and Lord Michael Levy, a Labour member of the House of Lords, said the party had a serious problem with anti-Semitism. Labour MP John Mann accused Livingstone of being a Nazi apologist. Livingstone said he was not saying that Hitler was a Zionist. \nLabour party leader Jeremy Corbyn suspended Livingstone from the party for two years pending an internal investigation. The suspension was extended in March of this year. Livingstone said Monday that he had been informed by his lawyer the disciplinary action could continue for months or years. Livingston said that since he was not planning to run for election, he would resign from the party.\nIn his resignation announcement Monday, Livingstone said that the way I made a historical argument has caused offence and upset in the Jewish community. I am truly sorry for that. \nHe said, I do not accept the allegation  that I am in any way guilty of anti-Semitism, saying I abhor anti-Semitism, I have fought it all my life and will continue to do so.\nCorbyn said, Ken Livingstones resignation is sad after such a long and vital contribution to London and progressive politics, but was the right thing to do. He also noted that Livingstones comments have been \"grossly insensitive.\"\nLivingstones career\nLivingstone joined the Labour party in 1969, first holding elected office in 1971. He was elected as an MP in 1987, and then served as the mayor of London from 2000 to 2008. \nIn 2006, Livingstone was suspended by ethical boards for four weeks for asking Oliver Finegold, a Jewish reporter, Were you a German war criminal? and comparing him to a concentration camp guard. Livingstone won an appeal against his suspension with the High Court of Justice.\nLivingstone could be eligible to rejoin the party at a later date as a \"suspended member\" with his disciplinary case still active, The Guardian reported.\nSources: BBC 1, BBC 2, The Daily Mail, The Guardian 1, The Guardian 2, The Independent, Vox",

      "Content": "Paul Manafort and a Russian colleague of his, Konstantin Kilimnik, were indicted on charges of obstructing justice and conspiracy to obstruct justice on Friday. Earlier this week, federal prosecutors alleged in a court motion that Manafort and a Person A, now identified as Kilimnik, attempted to contact witnesses to influence their testimony after Manaforts indictment in February. \nManafort was indicted on 32 federal charges in February, including filing false tax returns, failure to report on foreign accounts and bank fraud. The indictment followed 12 charges from last October. Manafort pleaded not guilty to the charges in both cases. The charges resulted from Special Counsel Robert Muellers investigation into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election and related matters, although the charges are unrelated to Manaforts involvement with the Trump campaign.\nKilimnik began working as a translator for Manafort in 2005 in his Kiev office, The Washington Post reported. Fridays indictment said Kilimnik oversaw the Kiev office of Manaforts Ukrainian political consulting business. Kilimnik said he and Manafort communicated while Manafort worked on Donald Trumps presidential campaign. He also said he visited the U.S. during May and August 2016. Kilimnik is currently believed to be in Moscow, according to The Washington Post.\nNews charges\nThe new obstruction of justice and conspiracy to obstruct justice charges allege that from in or about and between February 23, 2018, and April 2018 Manafort and Kilimnik knowingly and intentionally attempted to corruptly persuade witnesses with intent to influence, delay, and prevent the testimony of any person in an official proceeding, and knowingly conspired to do so. \nAccording to the 18-page motion to the court filed on Monday, Manafort phoned and messaged one of the witnesses on Feb. 24, the day after his former business partner Rick Gates pleaded guilty to two charges, and continued calling and messaging the witness for several days after. A sworn affidavit by Brock Domin, an FBI agent on the case said Manafort told the witness he wanted to give a heads-up about Hapsburg, then the witness hung up the phone. He tried to phone the witness again on Feb. 25 and Feb. 27, according to phone records cited in the motion. \nThe so-called Hapsburg group is a group of former European officials whom Manafort allegedly hired to lobby on behalf of then-Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovychs interests, according to Muellers team. Fridays indictment alleges members of the group, as well as Manafort, acted as unregistered agents of a foreign government (Ukraines) by not registering with the U.S. attorney generals office to conduct lobbying work. \nThe motion alleged Manafort also sent the witness a series of messages on an encrypted platform on Feb. 26, including one that said, This is paul, another with a link to a news article about Manafort allegedly paying Europeans for Ukrainian lobbying work, and another that said, We should talk. I have made clear that they worked in Europe.\nJudge Amy Berman Jackson scheduled a hearing for June 15 to address the alleged witness tampering.\nSources: Indictment, AP, NPR, Politico, The Washington Post,",

Slager is white and Scott was African American and was unarmed at the time of the shooting. U.S. District Judge David Norton ruled that Slager was guilty of second degree murder and obstruction of justice for false testimony. \nIn April 2015, Slager, now 36, stopped Scott, 50 at the time, for a broken tail light on Scotts car. Slager said that Scott grabbed the officers taser. Cellphone video taken by a passerby shows the two partway through their interaction, and does not capture this. The video shows the men as Scott starts running away from Slager. The officer fired eight shots as Scott ran away, five of which hit Scott. Slager was fired from the North Charleston police force after the shooting.\nA state murder case against Slager ended in a mistrial in 2016. Slagers attorney said during that trial that Slager had shot Scott out of fear for his life. Slager agreed in May of this year to plead guilty in federal court to violating Scotts civil rights, in exchange for state charges against him to be dropped. His plea ended both the states planned retrial and the federal case against him.\nSources: ABC News, NBC News, The New York Times",

      "Status": "publish",
      "Content": "The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) released a new proposal to amend greenhouse gas emissions guidelines for states to regulate existing coal plants. The plan, called the Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) rule, would replace the existing Clean Power Plan (CPP), which was introduced in 2015 under the Obama administration. The EPA under the Trump administration concluded, in accordance with a U.S. Supreme Court decision, that the CPP had exceeded the agencys statutory authority. \nThe ACE rule, which addresses coal plants specifically rather than the energy sector more broadly, was written as part of a review that President Donald Trump called for in a March 2017 executive order. In contrast to the CPP, which called for the eventual replacement or termination of coal energy production, the ACE permits existing coal plants to remain open if they become more efficient, according to the EPA.\nThe new proposal plans to address the reduction of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO2), in four main ways. The ACE rule:\n\n\tdefines a best system of emission reduction (BSER) for existing coal-fired power plants, such as heat-rate efficiency improvements. \n\tlists candidate technologies that individual states can use to establish their standards of performance.\n\testablishes a new preliminary test to determine whether changes made to power plants (either physical or operational) are considered a major modification requiring a New Source Review (NSR). The EPA says this is designed to encourage efficiency improvements at existing power plants. \n\testablishes new regulations to implement emissions guidelines under the Clean Air Act section 111(d). The EPA says this would give states adequate time and flexibility to develop their state plans.\n\nThe ACE Rule would restore the rule of law and empower states to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and provide modern, reliable, and affordable energy for all Americans, EPA Acting Administrator Andrew Wheeler said. Todays proposal provides the states and regulated community the certainty they need to continue environmental progress while fulfilling President Trumps goal of energy dominance.\nAccording to the EPAs estimates, the ACE rule could reduce costs associated with compliance by as much as an estimated $400 million annually compared to the CPP. The EPA also estimates it would lead to a 0.2 to 0.5 percent reduction in U.S. retail electricity prices.\nThe ACE rule also would allow for increased pollutants in the air, due to continued coal energy production. This could lead to an estimated 470 to 1,400 premature deaths each year compared regulations under the CPP, according to the EPA analysis. \nCoal plants emit more carbon pollution than all other sources, Carter Roberts, the CEO for environmental advocacy group World Wildlife Fund, said in a statement about the rule. Theyre often more expensive than natural gas, solar, or wind energy. And worst of all, they impose severe public health costs on us all.\nThe EPA received more than 270,000 comments since its advanced proposal about a replacement regulation from December 2017 until the end of the comment period on April 26 of this year. The EPA will now take public comment on the ACE rule for 60 days.\nBackground\nThe 2015 CPP had provided incentives for renewable energy and energy efficiency, as well asset carbon emissions regulations for each state based on energy consumption. The plan was intended to lower carbon emissions in compliance with the 2015 Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement, signed by 175 of the worlds 196 countries, committed signatories to reduce the use of fossil fuels and pollution under the premise that it could lower global temperatures by 3.6 F by 2025. \nIn 2016, 28 states and other plaintiffs challenged the CPPs legality, and the Supreme Court blocked its implementation in a 5 to 4 decision. Neither the Supreme Court nor the the lower court that heard oral arguments addressed the merits of the lawsuit at the time. The CPP was stayed by the Supreme Court and never went into effect. \nIn March of last year, Trump signed the Presidential Executive Order on Promoting Energy Independence and Economic Growth. The order rescinded six presidential actions by Barack Obama that had aimed at reducing carbon emissions or that related to the impacts of climate change. Trumps order also instructed the EPA and other government agencies to conduct a review of government actions related to domestic energy development including fossil fuels, and then rescind or suspend those that unduly burden the development of domestic energy resources beyond the degree necessary to protect the public interest or otherwise comply with the law. \nIn October 2017, then-EPA head Scott Pruitt announced the agencys plan to officially withdraw from the CPP. In December, the agency released its advance notice of\nproposed rulemaking, inviting public comment on specific topics for EPA consideration in drafting a future rule. \nThe new ACE rule proposal, released Tuesday, may fulfill a legal burden of the EPAs to set regulations related to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. A 2007 Supreme Court 5 to 4 ruling essentially concluded the EPA needed create regulations for greenhouse gas emissions, saying it could not avoid its statutory obligation by noting the uncertainty surrounding various features of climate change.\n\nSources: Bloomberg, EPA, EPA, EPA, EPA, EPA, CPP Repeal Proposal, Federal Register, Supreme Court, The Washington Post, White House",

Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov alleged that the new sanctions were an effort by the U.S. to influence Russias presidential election this Sunday and that Russia was preparing a response.\nThirteen of the individuals and three of the entities the Treasury Department sanctioned were also named in Special Counsel Robert Muellers February indictment for alleged attempts to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\nTreasury issued the sanctions under the amended Countering Americas Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA), as well as an amended version of Executive Order 13694. It said the sanctions are to address destabilizing activity emanating from within Russia. The sanctions block properties and interests in properties within U.S. jurisdiction and generally prohibit U.S. persons from engaging in transactions with the sanctioned entities and individuals, the Treasury Department said.\nThe Treasury sanctioned the Internet Research Agency LLC (IRA), Concord Management and Consulting LLC, and Concord Catering, which were also named in Muellers February indictment.\nThe department alleged that a Russian military intelligence organization called the Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU), also attempted to influence the 2016 U.S. election and was responsible for NotPetya, a type of malware attack that damages hard drive files. Russia has denied responsibility for NotPetya and denied attempting to influence the U.S. election. \nThe GRU had been previously sanctioned by President Barack Obama in December of 2016 for allegedly attempting to influence the 2016 election. On Thursday, the Treasury sanctioned six officials in the GRU, four of whom had been previously sanctioned at the same time as the GRU in 2016.\nA Russian intelligence organization, the Federal Security Service (FSB), was involved in the hacking of Yahoo accounts in 2014 and undermin[ing] cybersecurity on behalf of the Russian government, the Treasury alleged. In February of last year, the Justice Department indicted two individuals from the FSB for their alleged roles in the hacking of data from 500 million Yahoo accounts.\nThe Treasury statement alleged the FSB has used cyber tools to target Russians critical of the Russian government, other Russian citizens and officials, former officials from countries bordering Russia, and U.S. government officials including White House personnel.\nThe June 2017 NotPetya cyber-attack was a mock ransomware virus, according to The Washington Post, that affected computer systems of banks, energy firms, government officials, hospitals and an airport in Kiev, Ukraine. The U.S. attributed the attack to the Russian government, and the White House said the attack was part of the Kremlins ongoing effort to destabilize Ukraine. \nAccording to cybersecurity firm Cybereason, the NotPetya attack has cost $1.2 billion worldwide in lost revenue to companies. The White House said it caused billions of dollars in damage across Europe, Asia and the Americas and was the most destructive and costly cyber-attack in history.\nThe Treasury Department, in its statement announcing the sanctions, said the Trump administration has sanctioned more than 100 individuals and entities under its Ukraine and Russia-related sanctions authorities.\nSources: Politico, The Washington Post, US Treasury",

It also said malicious actors have abused a Facebook search feature that uses email addresses or phone numbers to find people on the site. The company said it believed most people on Facebook could have had their public profile scraped in this way, adding that it had disabled the feature.\nCambridge Analytica is a company that collected data to develop campaign ads and strategies in an attempt to help candidates such as President Donald Trump and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) get elected. The New York Times and The Observer reported last month that the firm had obtained data on more than 50 million Facebook users in a way that violated Facebooks policies.\nIn its announcement of the nine most important changes it was making to better protect user information, Facebook also mentioned changes to data policies for Events, Groups and Pages, and said it expect[s] to make more changes over the coming months.\nFacebook said starting on April 9 it will place a link at the top of users News Feeds showing what apps they use and what information they have shared with those apps. It will also inform users if their information may have been improperly shared with Cambridge Analytica. \nFacebooks announcement also addressed a feature of its Messenger app on Android devices that puts frequently contacted people at the top of a users contact list. The feature relies on users opting in on providing the app with their devices call and text histories. The company said it reviewed this feature to confirm that Facebook does not collect the content of messages, and that it would delete all data logs older than one year. It said it would still provide this feature on Messenger while stopping the upload of broader data such as call times.\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is scheduled to testify to the House Energy and Commerce Committee next week on the companys data privacy practices.\nSources: Facebook, Recode, The Washington Post",

      "Content": "This week, President Donald Trump tweeted that his two greatest assets have been mental stability and being, like, really smart. The tweets came after journalist Michael Wolffs newly-released book Fire and Fury included criticisms of the presidents mental capacity. Throughout his presidency, journalists, politicians and psychiatrists have commented on Trumps mental health, and this has led to debate about the Goldwater Rule and whether psychiatric evaluations of public figures violate professional ethics. Lets take a look.\nWhat is the Goldwater Rule?\nDuring the 1964 presidential campaign, psychiatrists publicly spoke about the mental state of then-candidate Barry Goldwater in Fact magazine's September-October 1964 edition. The magazine also asked 12,356 psychiatrists whether Goldwater was fit to be president, to which 2,417 psychiatrists responded. Of those who responded, 657 said he was fit, 1,189 said he was not, and 571 said they didn't know enough to answer the question. (Side note: Goldwater later sued the magazines editor and owner for libel and won.) \nPrior to the magazines publication, the APA had told the publications owner, Ralph Ginzburg, that the survey responses were not valid without a thorough clinical examination of Goldwater, according to Psychology Today. The magazine went on to publish the survey results and several comments made by licensed psychiatrists. In 1973, the APA added the Goldwater rule, also known as Section 7.3, to the APAs Principles of Medical Ethics guide.\nSection 7.3 of the APAs ethics guide states: On occasion psychiatrists are asked for an opinion about an individual who is in the light of public attention or who has disclosed information about himself/herself through public media. In such circumstances, a psychiatrist may share with the public his or her expertise about psychiatric issues in general. However, it is unethical for a psychiatrist to offer a professional opinion unless he or she has conducted an examination and has been granted proper authorization for such a statement.\nHow is the rule interpreted?\nThe psychiatric community has differing opinions on the scope of the rule. According to Dr. John Martin-Joy, a narrow view of the rule may be interpreted as prohibiting psychiatrists from providing comments about about public figures to the media without an in-person interview or consent from the subject. A broader interpretation, he says, may mean any comment without an interview or consent would be banned, whether its made to the media or otherwise. Such an interpretation could limit the work psychiatrists perform in courtrooms, insurance companies and other institutions. \nPsychiatrists can be asked to evaluate individuals they havent personally examined. For example, military leaders may request that a psychiatrist perform a psychological profile on a foreign leader to determine whether that person is a security threat. Psychiatrists may be invited to testify on the mental state of someone convicted of a crime. They may also be called to create profiles on historical figures  in 1931, former APA president A.A. Brill diagnosed Abraham Lincoln as a manic schizoid personality. Those who prefer a broader interpretation of the Goldwater rule may object to such psychological profiles.\nWhile the APA has had internal debates over the rules interpretation, Dr. Martin-Joy notes that the APA typically uses the narrower reading. In 2008, APA member Jerrold Post received an ethics complaint after the New York Times reported on a presentation he had made to a U.S. House of Representatives committee about former Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein. Post requested that the APAs ethics committee review the complaint. He asked them whether psychologically informed leadership studies based on careful research that do not specify a clinical diagnosis and are designed to enhance public and governmental understanding violated the Goldwater rule. \nThe APA determined that Post had not violated its ethics rule, and confirmed that psychological profiling that doesnt include a clinical diagnosis and is the product of scholarly research that has been subject to peer review and academic scrutiny, and is based on relevant standards of scholarship does not violate the rule.\nWhy does it matter?\nAccording to the APA, a psychiatric diagnosis requires an evaluation based on thorough history taking, examination, and, where applicable, collateral information. So rendering an opinion without such an evaluation is counter to the measures outlined by the profession. However, the APA allows for certain diagnoses that may not have been reached using established medical practices, as long as the evaluation reflects the limitations of the data and methods used. \nAccording to the APA, any evaluation conducted or opinion rendered based on methodology that departs from the established practice of an in-person evaluation must clearly identify the methods used and the limitations of those methods, such as the absence of an in-person examination. \nThe APA also notes that violating the Goldwater rule may stigmatize those with mental illness: Patients who see a psychiatrist, especially their own psychiatrist, offering opinions about individuals whom the psychiatrist has not examined may lose confidence in their psychiatrist and/or the profession and may additionally experience stigma related to their own diagnoses.\nThe APAs code of ethics is nonbinding and only pertains to APA members. A practicing psychiatrist may not lose their his medical license over such an ethical breach.\nPresident Trump\nIn August, Yale University psychiatry professor Dr. Bandy X. Lee sent a letter to members of Congress, saying that Trumps severe emotional impediments posed a grave threat to international security. In December, she briefed a dozen House and Senate members about Trumps mental state, telling CNN afterwards that it was \"obvious Trump meets the criteria for dangerousness. She also published the book, The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump: 27 Psychiatrists and Mental Health Experts Assess a President.\nDr. Allen Frances, in comparison, has said professionals shouldnt be diagnosing [public figures] at a distance. Frances is a former psychiatry department chairman at Duke University School of Medicine andhelped write the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, the main tool mental health professions use to make diagnoses.\n\nIn a statement last week, The American Psychiatric Association called for an end to psychiatrists providing professional opinions in the media about public figures whom they have not examined, whether it be on cable news appearances, books, or in social media. It said that, \"A proper psychiatric evaluation requires more than a review of television appearances, tweets and public comments. Psychiatrists are medical doctors; evaluating mental illness is no less thorough than diagnosing diabetes or heart disease.\nTrump underwent a physical exam at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center on Friday. Dr. Ronny L. Jackson, a rear admiral in the Navy and the White House physician, said it went exceptionally well, according to The New York Times. ",

      "Content": "A federal judge in San Diego issued a preliminary injunction on Tuesday ordering the government to reunite children with undocumented parents from whom they have been separated under the Trump administrations zero-tolerance policy. The injunction ordered that children under five years old must be reunited with their parents within 14 days, and older children must be reunited within 30 days. \nThe injunction also ordered that detained parents be allowed to contact their children by phone within 10 days if they are not already in contact with them. The injunction further orders parents not be detained or deported without their children unless authorities deem the adults to be unfit as parents or pose a danger to their children.\nThe American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) requested the injunction as part of a class-action lawsuit that originated with a case it brought in February on behalf of an asylum-seeking immigrant woman who had been separated from her daughter.\nThe ruling\nIn the ruling, U.S. District Judge Dana Sabraw wrote that the ACLU and those it represented had demonstrated a likelihood of success [of their case] on the [cases] merits, irreparable harm, and that the balance of equities and the public interest weigh in their favor, thus warranting issuance of a preliminary injunction.\nThe unfortunate reality is that under the present system migrant children are not accounted for with the same efficiency and accuracy as property, Sabraw wrote. Certainly, that cannot satisfy the requirements of due process.\nSabraw also concluded that there is no genuine dispute that the Government was not prepared to accommodate the mass influx of separated children. \nThe facts set forth before the court portray reactive governance  responses to address a chaotic circumstance of the governments own making. They belie measured and ordered governance, which is central to the concept of due process enshrined in our Constitution, Sabraw wrote.\nIn regards to enforcing immigration law, Sabraw wrote that the injunction does not implicate the Government's discretionary authority to enforce immigration or other criminal laws, including its decisions to release or detain class members. Rather, the Order addresses only the circumstances under which the Government may separate class members from their children, as well as the reunification of class members who are returned to immigration custody upon completion of any criminal proceedings.\nThe arguments\nIn the filing, the government argued that the court should give the agencies time to take action, rather than issuing an injunctive order. A court-imposed process is likely to slow the reunification process and cause confusion and conflicting obligations, rather than speed the process of reunifying families in a safe and efficient manner. Department of Justice lawyers argued that a court injunction would unnecessarily restrict the ability of immigration authorities to carry out their immigration enforcement mission and address smuggling concerns.\nThe ACLU alleged that the government had no meaningful plan for parent-child reunifications. Lee Gelernt, an attorney with the ACLU, wrote in the filing, thousands of families remain separated, and many parents have no idea where their children are or how to find them. Gelernt mentioned that a phone number for parents to call to obtain information on their separated children sometimes put callers on hold for 30 minutes, and this length of time was infeasible for detained parents.\nThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said in a statement over the weekend that the U.S. government knows the location of all children in its custody and is working to reunite them with their families. DHS said that 522 children had been reunited with their parents since May. This process is well coordinated, DHS said.\nLawyers for the government argued that Trumps executive order last week had addressed the issue of future family separations. The ACLU noted that the president could rescind executive orders at any time and that the order did not eliminate the need for an injunction.\nAfter the ruling, Gelernt said, This is a complete victory for these families and children who have been suffering for months.\nA Justice Department spokesperson said the decision makes it even more imperative that Congress finally act to give federal law enforcement the ability to simultaneously enforce the law and keep families together.\nBackground on the immigration policy\nThe Trump administration announced a zero-tolerance policy in April that called for all adults who were found illegally crossing the border to be charged with federal crimes for illegal entry or attempted entry. Under federal law, children cannot be held in adult criminal detention centers, so the policy has resulted in children being separated from parents or guardians. Last week, Trump issued an executive order that directed immigration authorities to detain alien families together where appropriate and consistent with law and available resources. \nDHS said last week 2,342 immigrant children had been separated from their parents since April. The Secretary for Health and Human Services, Alex Azar, said on Tuesday that the department has 2,047 immigrant children in its custody.\nSources: ACLU, CNN, The Los Angeles Times",

When asked about the accusation, Chinese Defense Ministry spokesman Ren Guoiqiang said, the situation you have mentioned absolutely does not exist.\nFox News reported on the allegations on Wednesday, citing South Korean media outlet The Chosun Ilbo. The Asian outlet reported that South Korean government sources said U.S. satellite photographs showed the alleged illicit transfers. \nThere will never be a friendly solution to the North Korea problem if this continues to happen, Trump tweeted on Thursday. \nHua Chunying, a spokeswoman for the Chinese foreign ministry, said the Chinese government has been completely and strictly enforcing Security Council resolutions pertaining to North Koreas missile and nuclear programs.\nIn November, the U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned six North Korean shipping and trading companies, and 20 of the companies ships, to disrupt North Korea's illicit funding of its unlawful nuclear and ballistic missile programs. At the same time, the Treasury Department sanctioned three Chinese trading companies it said had been selling non-petroleum goods to North Korea.\nIn September, the U.N. Security Council passed a resolution limiting refined petroleum exports to North Korea to 2 million barrels per year. Last week, the U.N. passed a new resolution limiting that total to 500,000 barrels. It included language that the Security Council would take action to restrict further the export of petroleum to North Korea if it performs more intercontinental ballistic missile or nuclear tests. In addition to limiting refined petroleum, the December resolution limited crude oil exports to North Korea to 4 million barrels.\nSources: Fox News, Reuters, The Guardian",

The Fed said, the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising at a solid rate, based on information it received since it met in May.\nThe Fed predicted the U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) would grow 2.8 percent in 2018, an increase from its forecast of 2.7 percent in March.\nOn a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy have moved close to 2 percent, the Fed announced. It also said it would make future adjustments to the federal funds rate, with the objective of 2 percent inflation and maximum employment. \nThe federal funds rate refers to the interest rate banks or depository institutions charge for overnight loans to other banks, which are needed to maintain their reserve requirements, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) website explains. The reserve requirement is a minimum amount of money the Federal Reserve requires a bank to have at a given time, often about 10 percent of an individual banks total deposits. It is designed to avoid bank failures should depositors make too many withdrawals, according to Investopedia. \nThe Fed projected median federal funds rates of 2.4 percent in 2018, 3.1 percent in 2019 and 3.4 percent in 2020. The numbers it projected in March were 2.1 percent in 2018, 2.9 percent in 2019 and 3.4 percent in 2020. \nThe Fed forecasted 2.4 percent GDP growth in 2019, and 2 percent in 2020. The forecast for core inflation, which excludes food and energy prices, is 2.1 percent for 2018, 2019 and 2020. \nThe unemployment rate was forecast to be 3.6 percent in 2018, the Fed reported, and would decrease to an estimated 3.5 percent in 2019 and 2020. These figures are down from its March projections, which were 3.8 percent unemployment in 2018, and 3.6 percent in 2019 and 2020. The current unemployment rate of 3.8 percent is the lowest since 2000.\nThe Federal Reserve raised the federal funds rate three times in 2017.\nSources: Bloomberg, CNN, Federal Reserve 1, Federal Reserve 2, Investopedia",

If the results are confirmed, it would remove the need for a second round of voting. After this election, changes to presidential powers are scheduled to take effect.\n\nErdoans Justice and Development Party (AKP), and its alliance partner the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) won 342 out of 600, or 57 percent, of parliamentary seats in the general election also held on Sunday, according to unofficial results. \nThe second closest presidential candidate was Muharrem nce with 30.8 percent of the vote. His party, the Republican People's Party (CHP), won 146 parliamentary seats, or 24.3 percent, Anadolu Agency reported. \nVoter turnout was about 87 percent, Anadolu Agency reported, or about 47.85 percent of the approximate 55 million eligible voters. Turkeys total population is 81 million. The elections were originally scheduled for November 2019, until April this year when Erdoan called them early. \nIn a speech Sunday, Erdoan said, This has been another test of democracy and we have passed this test successfully.\nErdoan, 64, was Turkeys prime minister from 2003 to 2014 and has been president since 2014. If his election is confirmed, this will be Erdoans second term as Turkeys president.\nDiffering results\nThe Vice Chairman of CHP said he received official information from the Supreme Election Council that 39 percent of ballots had been counted and Erdoan had won 51.7 percent of the vote and nce had won 33.6 percent. \nThe CHP said the presidential vote count was not over, and it certainly would go to a second round of voting. A runoff election is required if no candidate wins at least 50 percent of the vote. If required, the next round of voting is scheduled for July 8. \nConstitutional changes\nIn April of last year, Turkey passed a referendum on constitutional changes in a 51.4 percent vote. The changes, which are scheduled to be implemented after this presidential election, include eliminating the position of prime minister, allowing the president to appoint ministers without parliamentary approval and increasing the numbers of senior judges chosen by the president. \nThe referendum vote was held almost a year after a failed coup attempt to overthrow Erdoans government. After the July 2016 coup attempt, which led to 241 deaths, Turkey implemented a state of emergency that is still in place. \nA U.N. Human Rights Office report in March said there had been human rights violations in Turkey under the state of emergency, including arbitrary detentions and torture.\nSources: Anadolu Agency Election Results, Anadolu Agency, BBC 1, BBC 2, CNN, The New York Times, The Washington Post",

It also proposes a possible charge on single-use plastic containers and the creation of plastics-free aisles at supermarkets where items would not be packaged in plastic.\nThe environment department headed by Michael Gove authored the plan and published it on Thursday. It also includes proposals for government-funded research on plastics innovation and government aid to developing nations to reduce plastic waste and pollution.\nMay said that plastic waste can end up in waterways and oceans, and that one third of fish caught in the English Channel contain some pieces of plastic in them. She said she would lobby leaders at a Commonwealth summit in April for a charter by the member states of the Commonwealth of Nations to reduce plastic waste in oceans. The Commonwealth of Nations is a group of 52 states, mostly former-British colonies, which includes Canada and Australia.\nToday I can confirm that the UK will demonstrate global leadership. We must reduce the demand for plastic, reduce the number of plastics in circulation and improve our recycling rates, Conservative party leader May said while announcing the plan. \nGreenpeace noted that the plan did not contain a deposit return program for plastic bottles. The government had said it would consider such a program. \nFriends of the Earth, a non-governmental environmental organization, said a clear timetable for the 25-year plan was needed.

      "Content": "The U.S. Department of the Interior released a plan on Thursday to allow for new areas of offshore oil and gas drilling. The proposal includes areas in the Atlantic, Pacific and Arctic Oceans, as well as the Gulf of Mexico. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said the plan was a draft program and that nothing is final yet. He added that states, local communities and congressional delegations will all have a say before the Interior finalizes its plan. \nThe Interiors 2019-2024 five-year plan proposes 47 possible areas where companies can buy leases to drill, including some in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. The Obama administrations 2017-2022 plan had 11 lease sales, none of them in the Atlantic or Pacific.\nThe proposed plan would allow drilling in 90 percent of the outer continental shelf, an area covering 98 percent of U.S. recoverable offshore oil and gas reserves. According to the Interior, the current plan allows drilling in six percent of the outer continental shelf. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management estimates U.S. offshore oil reserves to be 90 billion barrels and natural gas reserves to be 127 trillion cubic feet.\nThe Interior plans to hold meetings in 2018 to hear public input on the plan.\nReasons given for and against the plan\nZinke said, Responsibly developing our energy resources on the Outer Continental Shelf in a safe and well-regulated way is important to our economy and energy security, and it provides billions of dollars to fund the conservation of our coastlines, public lands and parks. \nSome politicians oppose new drilling along their states shorelines. According to Diane Hoskins, campaign director of the nonprofit group Oceana, this includes both Republican and Democratic governors from New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, California, Oregon and Washington. Floridas Republican governor Rick Scott also opposes new drilling, saying his concern was protecting his states natural resources. New Jerseys Republican governor Chris Christie mentioned beach tourism as a reason for his opposition.\nPrevious drilling regulations\nIn December 2016, then-President Barack Obama imposed a ban on drilling in 125 million acres of the Arctic Ocean, and in some areas of the Atlantic Ocean. In April 2017, U.S. President Donald Trump issued an executive order that rescinded Obamas ban and called for a review of some offshore drilling rules.\nOn Dec. 28, 2017, the Interiors Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) announced a proposal to rescind some of the offshore oil drilling safety regulations put in place by the Obama administration in April 2016. The regulations were introduced after oil company BPs Deepwater Horizon offshore drilling accident in 2010 that spilled 4.9 million barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico, according to The New York Times. \nBSEE Director Scott A. Angelle said the December proposal to rescind some of the safety regulations was designed to reduce a regulatory burden on oil companies and encourage more production.\nSources: CNN, Fox News, The Daily Caller, The New York Times, The Washington Post",

      "Content": "The U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) reported on Thursday that 2017 was the second hottest year since 1880, the earliest year NASA uses to compare global temperature records. The National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), using different methodologies, determined 2017 was the third hottest year, after 2016 and 2015. NASA said that the temperature has risen about 2 degree Fahrenheit (1.1 degree Celsius) over the past century.\nNASA estimated 2017 would have been the hottest year on record were it not for the El Nio warming event that occurred during the majority of 2015 and the first third of 2016, and the La Nia cooling event starting in the second half of 2017. El Nio and La Nia periods are part of the natural variations in the surface temperature of the Pacific Ocean; El Nio times coincide with an increase in temperatures, and La Nia a decrease in temperatures.\nBoth NASAs and NOAAs analyses show that the five warmest years on record have occurred since 2010. Petteri Taalas, Secretary General of the U.N.s World Meteorological Organizations, said that 17 of the 18 hottest years on record have come this century.\nNASA attributed the increase in average temperature since the end of the 1800s as largely due to increased carbon dioxide and other human-made emissions into the atmosphere. \nThe Paris Agreement set a goal of limiting average temperatures to no more than a 2.7 degree Fahrenheit (1.5 degree Celsius) increase since pre-industrial levels.\nData collection\nNASA says its analysis uses surface temperature measurements from 6,300 locations around the world on land and sea. NASA notes that temperature recording locations and measurement techniques have changed with time. This variation introduces some uncertainty, and can be partially accounted for in models. Given that, NASA estimates accuracy to within 0.1 degree Fahrenheit with a 95 percent certainty level. NOAA's data collection methods differ, which accounts for the discrepancies between its findings and NASA's findings for the year 2017.\nSources: BBC, CNN, NASA",

      "Content": "Over the weekend, news outlets reported that U.S. federal authorities were unable to confirm the whereabouts of 1,500 immigrant children. The story was based on a report the Health and Human Services (HHS) Department gave to a Senate subcommittee last month. The HHS's Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) reported on the unaccompanied alien children program, which is responsible for the care and placement of children who arrive at the U.S.-Mexico border without a parent or guardian. \nThe report said that during safety and well-being calls to 7,635 children and their sponsors from October to December last year, the agency was unable to determine with certainty the whereabouts of 1,475 children. The 7,635 well-being calls found that 52 children were living in the care of someone else, eight had run away and five had been deported.\nThe report also said the long-standing interpretation of the law has been that ORR was not legally responsible for children after they are released to their sponsors, adding that the ORR is taking a fresh look at that question as a matter ofboth legal interpretation and appropriate policy. \nThe office is exploring the question of ORRs responsibilities  and whether the level of responsibility would differ depending on the childs relationship to his or her sponsor, the report said. Approximately 85 percent of sponsors are parents or family members, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) told The Washington Post. \nThe ORR report was presented on April 26 to the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, a subgroup of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. Steven Wagner, the acting assistant secretary for the Administration for Children and Families spoke before the committee.\nSeparating immigrant children from adults\nAs a separate matter, some children also arrive at the U.S. border with adults who are illegally entering the U.S. The current DHS policy can result in immigrant children being separated from these adults upon entry into the U.S.\nOn May 7, Attorney General Jeff Sessions said the DHS would refer 100 percent of illegal Southwest Border crossings to the Department of Justice for prosecution. He also said, If you are smuggling a child, then we will prosecute you and that child will be separated from you as required by law. Children are prohibited from being put in criminal jails, The Washington Post reported; adults who are prosecuted may be separated from children they are accompanying. \nIf children are separated from detained adults, Immigration and Customs Enforcement will transfer them to the ORR, according to AP. In 2017, children stayed in ORR custody for 51 days on average, before being placed with sponsors.\nSources: DOJ Press Release, ORR report, CNN, Fox News, The Washington Post",

About 22,000 teachers in the state went on strike on Feb. 22, with the support of three school unions. Union leaders said teachers would go back to work if Gov. Jim Justice signed the 5 percent raise into law.\nThe American Federation of Teachers said the agreement with lawmakers reached on Tuesday would include keeping premiums on teachers health plans the same for 16 months. Justice also agreed to form a task force by March 13 to examine the state health insurance program. Senate Finance Chair Craig Blair said the budget would be reduced in other areas to offset the cost of the raises.\nThe West Virginia teachers' strike is the longest in the state's history, according to Bloomberg. The last time teachers received a state-wide pay raise was in 2014. The state ranks 48th in the U.S. for teachers average annual salaries, according to the National Education Association.\nTeachers in Oklahoma are reportedly also considering striking over pay. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average salary for teachers in Oklahoma is the lowest in the U.S. The Oklahoma Education Association (OEA) said teachers could go on strike unless lawmakers pass a bill to give teachers raises by a certain time that it will announce later. The Oklahoma legislature has not passed teacher raises in the past 10 years, according to Bloomberg.\nSources: Bloomberg, CNN, USA Today",

The deal is valued at an estimated $133.3 million. A State Department official said the potential sale would enhance Japans Maritime Self Defense Forces ability to defend Japan and the Western Pacific from ballistic missile threats.\nOn Aug. 29, North Korea launched a ballistic missile that flew over Japan for the first time since 2009, after which Japan called a meeting with the U.N. Security Council. On Nov. 29, the North launched an intercontinental ballistic missile, saying the missile meets the goal of the completion of the rocket weaponry system development and that it was capable of striking the U.S. mainland. \nIn December, Japan formally decided to use U.S.-made ground-based Aegis radar stations and interceptors to expand its defense system. According to Japans state broadcaster NHK, last month, Japans cabinet approved a plan for the country to purchase two U.S.-built Aegis missile defense systems. A U.S. State Department official confirmed Wednesday that the SM-3 Block IIA missile in the proposed sale can be deployed on land or on Aegis-class destroyers.\nFor more information on North Koreas missile and nuclear development, see our timeline here.\nSources: CNN, Reuters",

      "Content": "On Friday, President Donald Trump said he was considering a list of about five people for a Supreme Court nominee that he would announce on July 9. Trump said he is considering two women and would probably interview about six or seven candidates altogether for the seat being vacated by Justice Anthony Kennedy, who announced his retirement on Wednesday, effective July 31. Trump said he would pick a nominee from the list of 25 names he released last November. \nWe have great people, Trump said of the list, adding that they were highly talented, very brilliant, mostly conservative judges. On Wednesday, Trump said he was honored to be able to select the next Supreme Court nominee, adding that, We have to pick one thats going to be there for 40 years, 45 years.\nThe Washington Post reported that an anonymous Trump adviser said the president was considering three attributes for the nominee: 1) extraordinarily well qualified, 2) not weak, meaning someone with independent judgement such as from the political and social fashions of the day, and 3) someone who will interpret the Constitution the way the framers meant it to be.\nOutside of war and peace, of course, the most important decision you make is the selection of a Supreme Court judge, Trump said Friday.\nWhen asked about whether his nominee would support the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that established a womans right to have an abortion, Trump said, Im not going to ask them that question.\nOn Sunday, Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) said, I would not support a nominee who demonstrated hostility to Roe v. Wade because that would mean to me that their judicial philosophy did not include a respect for established decisions, established law.\nSome of Kennedys votes on abortion, gay rights, the death penalty and affirmative action have sided with a majority of the Democrat-appointed justices in cases decided by two votes or less. \nThe candidates\nThe top candidates the president may be considering, according to the Post, include:\n\n\tThomas M. Hardiman, U.S. Court of Appeals Judge\n\tAmy Coney Barrett, U.S. Court of Appeals Judge \n\tBrett M. Kavanaugh, U.S. Circuit Judge \n\tRaymond Kethledge, U.S. Circuit Judge \n\tAmul Thapar, U.S. Court of Appeals Judge \n\nThe New York Times listed U.S. Court of Appeals Judge Joan L. Larsen in place of Kethledge on its front-runners list, and also included U.S. Court of Appeals Judge William H. Pryor Jr. on the list.\nThere is one current Senator on the list of 25 potential candidates: Mike Lee (R-Utah). The remaining candidates were all judges at the time the White House released the list.\nRepublican leaders plan to have Trumps nominee speak to senators in person through early August, with confirmation hearings beginning in late August, committee votes by early September, and a vote in the full Senate later that month so a new justice can be sworn in before the start of the next court term on Oct. 1, the Post reported. \nDemocratic leaders said the Senate should wait until newly-elected Senators are sworn in after the November midterm elections before voting on a nominee. In 2016, the Senate delayed voting on then-President Barack Obamas nominee, Merrick Garland, until Trump was elected, and then confirmed Trumps nominee, Neil Gorsuch, for the vacant seat in April 2017.\nBackground on the Supreme Court\nApproximately 7,000 to 8,000 new cases are filed each term in the Supreme Court, according to its website. For a case to be considered before the court, four judges must select it to be heard.\nCourt sessions usually continue until late June or early July, according to the courts website. During the summer, justices analyze new petitions for cases to review, consider motions and applications, and prepare for cases to be argued in the fall.\nCurrent makeup of the court\nJustices appointed by Republican presidents\nJohn G. Roberts, Jr., 63, Chief Justice, was nominated by then-President George W. Bush and took his seat on Sept. 29, 2005.\nAnthony M. Kennedy, 81, Associate Justice, was nominated by then-President Ronald Reagan and took his seat on Feb. 18, 1988.\nClarence Thomas, 70, Associate Justice, was nominated by then-President George H.W.

      "Content": "On Friday, a federal judge ordered the U.S. government to restart the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which the Trump administration rescinded last year. The DACA program offers certain illegal immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as minors renewable 2-year work permits and protection from deportation. The courts order to restart DACA is delayed until Aug. 23 to give the administration an opportunity to appeal the decision. \nThe DACA program, which was first implemented under the Obama administration, applies to illegal immigrants who came to the U.S. before June 15, 2012, and were under the age of 16 when they arrived. \nIn September of last year, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that DACA was being rescinded, saying that new applications as well as renewals after a certain date would not be accepted. In April of this year, Judge John Bates of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia gave the Trump administration 90 days to better explain its reason for declaring the DACA program unlawful. \nIn his 25-page ruling on Friday, Bates said a June memo from Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen failed to elaborate meaningfully on the agency's primary rationale for rescinding DACA. \nNielsen had written that she agreed with the legal argument described in a Sept. 5, 2017 directive from then-acting Secretary Elaine Duke. Nielsen argued that DHS has the power to absolve the program since the department had created it, and that it would likely be found unconstitutional in another lawsuit. Bates said Nielsen did not provide a considered legal assessment that this court could subject to judicial review.\nFederal district courts in California and New York, in January and February rulings, respectively, ordered the government to accept DACA work permit renewals. Fridays ruling also applies to accepting new applications. \nIn a lawsuit filed in May, Texas and six other states sued the government, arguing the DACA program was unlawful and asking for the program to end. Specifically, the suit requested the court prohibit the government from issuing or renewing DACA permits in the future, effectively phasing out the program within two years. The judge in that case is expected to rule within the next week, CNN reported. \nMore than 700,000 people are currently enrolled in the DACA program. \nFor more information on DACA, see our explainer here.\nSources: CNN, Politico",

China first announced the plan on March 23, in response to U.S. President Donald Trumps decision to introduce tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from multiple countries, including China. \n\nChina is adding a 15 percent tariff on 120 products, including fruits, nuts, wine ethanol and steel pipes, and a 25 percent tariff on eight products, including recycled aluminum and pork. China's Ministry of Commerce released a statement on Sunday night that announced the tariffs would go into effect on Monday.\nThe ministry said that the U.S. tariffs seriously violate the World Trade Organization (WTO) policies against non-discrimination in multilateral trade between members. The U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs do not apply to some countries, including Canada, Mexico and South Korea. \nChinas ministry said the U.S. declined to respond to Chinas request through the WTO for consultation on the matter, which the ministry said alleviated the country from obligations to the U.S. As a WTO member, China has the right not to meet some former obligations to the United States, the ministry said. Chinas suspension of its tariff concessions is a legitimate action adopted under WTO rules to safeguard Chinas interests.\nOn March 22, the U.S. also announced a plan to implement additional tariffs on up to $60 billion of Chinese goods. The U.S. Office of the United States Trade Representative has sent that plan for public review during a period of at least 30 days before implementation. CNN cited Arthur Kroeber, a partner at economic research firm Gavekal, saying that China may respond to those planned tariffs by placing more on U.S. agricultural products. \nU.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the U.S. and China are in private discussions aimed at avoiding more increases to tariffs. Chinas commerce ministry said it hoped the U.S. would remove its tariffs as soon as possible so that the trading of products between China and the United States will return to a normal track.\"\nThe U.S. had a trade deficit in goods to China of $375 billion last year, according to CNN. Chinese news outlet Xinhua reported that China had a trade deficit in services to the U.S. of $255 billion in 2017. \nSources: CNN Money, Reuters, Xinhua",

      "Content": "President Donald Trump met with Britains Queen Elizabeth for the first time in an official capacity on Friday evening, after arriving in the U.K. on Thursday for a four day state visit. When Trump arrived in the country, he was met by Prime Minister Theresa May at a welcome ceremony, and later met with U.S. Ambassador to the U.K. Woody Johnson. Protests against Trumps visit were held in London on Friday. \nOn Friday, Trump met with May and other U.K. leaders for bilateral talks and a working lunch at Chequers, at which they discussed economic cooperation and a potential free trade deal for after the U.K. leaves the European Union. May said the two countries agreed to pursue an ambitious deal on free trade, using as a platform the Chequers agreement, which outlined the U.K.s vision for a relationship with the EU after it leaves the union. The U.K. Cabinet agreed to the priorities, which included a common rulebook for goods regulations and the elimination of the need for customs; some ministers resigned over the agreement. \nThe U.S. and U.K. would reach a trade deal that works for both countries right across our economies, a deal that builds on the UKs independent trade policy, reducing tariffs; delivering a gold standard in financial services cooperation; and, as two of the worlds most advanced economies, seizing the opportunity of new technology, May said. \nOn Thursday, British tabloid outlet The Sun published an interview with Trump in which he said May did not listen to his advice for how to exit the EU. If they do a deal like that, we would be dealing with the European Union instead of dealing with the U.K., so it will probably kill the deal, Trump said about Mays Chequers agreement. The president also said in the interview that he thought Boris Johnson, who recently resigned as the foreign secretary, would be a great prime minister.\"\nOn Friday, Trump said he had made the comments after reading some reports that the U.K. would not be able to make a free trade agreement with the U.S. if it went forward with the Chequers agreement. I believe after speaking with the prime minister's people that [a U.S.-U.K. free trade agreement] will absolutely be possible,\" Trump said. \"The only thing I ask of Theresa is that we make sure we can trade, that we don't have any restrictions, because we want to trade with the UK and the UK wants to trade with us.\" \nTrump also said he apologized to May for the interview, saying The Sun left out all the positive comments he had made about the prime minister and calling the outlet fake news. He called May a total professional, and said the U.S.-U.K. relationship is the highest grade of special.\nWhile the U.K. and U.S. leaders were working on Friday, Mays husband, Philip May hosted Melania Trump at the Royal Hospital Chelsea, a home for retired soldiers. The first lady met with school children and retired soldiers, toured the chapel on the grounds, spoke about her Be Best initiative and played a game of lawn bowling.\nOn Friday evening, Trump and the first lady were received by Queen Elizabeth II at Windsor Castle. After inspecting the Honor Guard, the Trumps had tea with the queen. This was the first time during his administration that Trump has met Queen Elizabeth. Trump called the queen an incredible woman.\nOver the course of Trumps four day visit, 60 protests against his visit were scheduled, The Hill reported. On Friday, a demonstration in London was attended by an estimated 250,000 people, according to Stop Trump organizers. During that protest, a Trump baby blimp was flown above Parliament Square, held by protesters wearing red hats that said Trump babysitter.\nThe president and first lady are scheduled to spend the weekend in Scotland. They will travel to Helsinki, Finland next week for the presidents planned summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\nSources: CNN 1, CNN 2, CNN 3, The Hill, Politico, The Sun, White House 1600 Daily",

      "Content": "The Ukraine security service said on Wednesday it had faked the murder of Russian journalist Arkady Babchenko, who had been reported shot dead in Kiev the day before. On Wednesday, Babchenko apologized, and said the planning of his fake murder had been ongoing for two months. The security service said it had received reports of possible attempts on Babchenkos life and used the faked murder to collect evidence and prevent his actual murder. \nUkraine Prosecutor General, Larisa Sarga said two people were in custody after the fake murder operation. \nOn Tuesday, Ukrainian state news agency Ukrinform had reported Babchenko, 41, was shot in the back and died in an ambulance on the way to a hospital. Ukrainian police said he was shot three times as he left his apartment to buy bread. \nSpeaking at a Wednesday news conference about his faked death, Babchenko said, I have been forced to bury my friends and colleagues many times and I know the sickening feeling. He added, Special apologies to my wife, Olechka, there was no other option. Babchenko did not say who was aware of the plan.\nThe head of the Ukraine security service, Vasyl Hrytsak, said a Ukrainian citizen was attempting to pay for Babchenkos murder. Hrytsak said the Ukrainian suspect was acting on behalf of Russian security services and offered $30,000 for someone to kill Babchenko. Hrytsak said one of the people that the suspect talked to in an attempt to solicit a paid assassination later informed authorities. \nHrytsak said security services had arrested the Ukrainian who was offering money for Babchenkos killing. The Ukraine security service later said the man had transferred a $15,000 deposit for the killing. \nThe security service did not say how its fake murder operation led to the arrest of the two people. It is possible that one was arrested with the money transfer as evidence.\nThe Russian foreign ministry said the faked murder was done for propagandistic effect, and that it was happy to hear that Babchenko was alive, according to Russia's Interfax news agency.\nUkrainian President Petro Poroshenko tweeted, \"It is unlikely that Moscow will calm down. I've given an order to provide Arkady and his family with protection.\nBabchenko left Russia in 2017 after a negative response to a post he made on social media criticizing Russias military actions in Syria. He has also criticized Russias military actions eastern Ukraine. According to The Guardian, there have been multiple journalists who have been killed in recent years in Kiev and whose murders remain unsolved. \nSources: BBC, CNN, The Guardian",

      "Content": "The U.S. Supreme Court ruled 5-4 on Friday that the government \"generally\" must obtain a warrant to access certain cell phone records collected and stored by wireless carrier companies. The type of information, called cell-site location information (CSLI), is time-stamped records that cell phones generate when they connect to cellular towers.\nThe case, Carpenter v. United States, addressed the question of whether accessing CSLI data violated the Fourth Amendment, which protects people from unreasonable searches and seizures. The ruling was supported by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan. Justices Anthony Kennedy, Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch dissented. \nWe decline to grant the state unrestricted access to a wireless carriers database of physical location information, Chief Justice Roberts wrote in the majority opinion. \nBackground to the case\nThe case before the Supreme Court involved Timothy Carpenter, who was convicted of robbery in part based on cell phone location data. In 2011, police arrested four men suspected of a series of robberies that took place in Michigan and Ohio. One of the suspects confessed to nine robberies over four months and told the FBI the identity and cell phone numbers of some of his accomplices. \nThe FBI reviewed the suspects call records and found additional numbers he called at near the time of the robberies. Using that information, prosecutors used the Stored Communications Act to apply for court orders to obtain the cell phone records of Carpenter. The Act allows the government to obtain a court order if the government entity offers specific and articulable facts showing that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the contents of a wire or electronic communication, or the records or other information sought, are relevant and material to an ongoing criminal investigation. \nAfter receiving and executing the court order, investigators obtained 12,898 location points from Carpenters wireless carriers. Before his trial, Carpenter moved to suppress the CSLI data, arguing the seizure of the records had been obtained without a warrant supported by probable cause and therefore violated the Fourth Amendment. \nUsing the location data and testimony from other suspects, Carpenter was convicted of six counts of robbery and five counts of carrying a firearm during a federal crime of violence, and sentenced to 116 years in prison. \nMajority opinion\nChief Justice Roberts wrote in the majority opinion, individuals have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the whole of their physical movements, and when the Government tracks the location of a cell phone it achieves near perfect surveillance, as if it had attached an ankle monitor to the phones user.\nA warrant is required only in the rare case where the suspect has a legitimate privacy interest in records held by a third party, the ruling stated. And even though the Government will generally need a warrant to access CSLI, case-specific exceptionse.g., exigent circumstancesmay support a warrantless search. Roberts said, such exigencies include the need to pursue a fleeing suspect, protect individuals who are threatened with imminent harm, or prevent the imminent destruction of evidence.\nIn the 1979 Smith v. Maryland ruling, the Supreme Court said an individual could have no reasonable expectation of privacy in numbers dialed from a phone. The courts opinion was that information is voluntarily given to a third party: the phone company. In 1976s United States v. Miller, the Supreme Court ruled that an individual could have no reasonable expectation of privacy in financial records held by a bank.\nFridays ruling said, tracking a persons past movements through CSLI  is detailed, encyclopedic, and effortlessly compiled and given the unique nature of cell-site records, this Court declines to extend Smith and Miller to cover them.\nRoberts also wrote the ruling was narrow and does not express a view on matters not before the Court; does not disturb the application of Smith and Miller or call into question conventional surveillance techniques and tools, such as security cameras; does not address other business records that might incidentally reveal location information; and does not consider other collection techniques involving foreign affairs or national security.\nDissenting opinions\nEach of the four dissenting justices wrote their own opinion.\nJustice Kennedy wrote that the ruling puts needed, reasonable, accepted, lawful and congressionally authorized criminal investigations at serious risk in serious cases, often when law enforcement seeks to prevent the threat of violent crimes.\" He wrote that CSLI records are no different from the many other kinds of business records the Government has a lawful right to obtain by compulsory process. Justices Thomas and Alito joined Kennedy in this dissenting opinion, in addition to writing their own.\nJustice Alito said, the Court's reasoning fractures two fundamental pillars of Fourth Amendment law, and in doing so, it guarantees a blizzard of litigation while threatening many legitimate and valuable investigative practices upon which law enforcement has rightfully come to rely. Justice Thomas joined Alito in this opinion.\nJustice Thomas wrote: The Government did not search Carpenters property. He did not create the records, he does not maintain them, he cannot control them, and he cannot destroy them. Neither the terms of his contracts nor any provision of law makes the records his. The records belong to MetroPCS and Sprint.\nJustice Gorsuch questioned, why is someones location when using a phone so much more sensitive than who he was talking to (Smith) or what financial transactions he engaged in (Miller)?\n\nSources: Carpenter v.

      "Content": "Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte said in a statement Wednesday that the country was immediately withdrawing from the Rome Statute, the founding treaty of the International Criminal Court (ICC). He said the withdrawal was due to \"baseless, unprecedented and outrageous attacks\" by U.N. officials, and the ICC not following due process and the presumption of innocence. About a month ago, the ICC opened a preliminary investigation into thousands of deaths related to a police campaign against drug dealers in the Philippines.\nLast year, Philippine lawyer Jude Sabio filed a complaint with the ICC accusing Duterte and 11 of his associates of crimes against humanity, according to The Washington Post.\nThe ICC tries people for \"genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity and aggression,\" according to its website. The ICC can investigate and prosecute these crimes in a country when local authorities do not. Duterte spokesman Harry Roque said local authorities will investigate crimes and that there is no need for ICC involvement.\nPolice have said they have killed about 4,100 drug dealers who violently resisted arrest. Police said they were not involved in about 2,300 drug-related homicides, some of which are unsolved. Since Duterte was elected president in 2016, an estimated 12,000 Filipinos have been killed by police or \"men on motorbikes, the Post reported.\nThe Philippines ratified the Rome Statute in 2011, thus subjecting itself to the ICCs jurisdiction. The statute says withdrawal from the agreement takes effect a year after the U.N. secretary general receives a written request to leave. Duterte said in his statement this would not apply to the Philippines as \"there appears to be fraud in entering [into] such [an] agreement.\" His legal counsel said because Philippines' entry into the Rome Statute was not announced in the countrys official gazette, it did not apply. \nSources: Reuters, The Washington Post",

      "Content": "Late on Monday, Special Counsel Robert Muellers investigative team accused former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort of attempting to tamper with witnesses in his upcoming trial for alleged fraud, money laundering and tax evasion. The charges resulted from Mueller's investigation into alleged Russian election interference and related matters, though involve incidents that predate Manaforts involvement with the Trump campaign. Manafort pleaded not guilty to those crimes in March. His trial is scheduled to begin July 10\nAndrew Weissmann, a prosecutor on Muellers team, filed an 18-page motion with a Washington court on Monday that alleged Manafort and an associate identified as Person A attempted to contact witnesses to influence their testimony after Manaforts indictment in February. The motion calls for an immediate hearing to determine if the men contacted two unnamed witnesses in an effort to secure materially false testimony. \nThe witnesses reportedly worked for the so-called Hapsburg Group  a group of former European officials whom Mueller alleged that Manafort hired to lobby on behalf of then Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovychs interests.\nAccording to a sworn affidavit by Brock Domin, a FBI agent on the case, Manafort phoned and messaged one of the witnesses on Feb. 24, the day after his former business partner Rick Gates pleaded guilty to two charges, and continued calling and messaging him several days after. The affidavit said Manafort told the witness he wanted to give a heads-up about Hapsburg, then the witness hung up the phone. He tried to phone the witness again on Feb. 25 and Feb 27, according to the phone records cited in the motion.\nThe motion alleges Manafort sent the witness a series of messages on an encrypted platform on Feb. 26, including one that said This is paul, another with a link to a news article about Manafort allegedly paying Europeans for Ukrainian lobbying work and another that said, We should talk. I have made clear that they worked in Europe. \nThe politicians in the so-called Hapsburg Group who reportedly lobbied for Yanukovych include former Austrian chancellor Alfred Gusenbauer and former Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi, Politico reported. According to disclosure filings filed after the time, they visited Washington and met with members of Congress in 2013. Both have said Manafort did not pay them. \nSpokespeople for both Manafort and Muellers office declined to comment to The Washington Post on Monday night. \nIn January, Manafort sued Mueller and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, alleging they exceed the scope of their authority in investigating any coordination between Manafort and Russia prior to his work on the Trump campaign.\nSources: AP, Politico, The Washington Post",

The jury could not reach a verdict on the remaining 10 charges, and U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis declared a mistrial on those counts.\nEllis has not yet set a sentencing date.\nManafort's defense lawyer Kevin Downing said in a statement outside the courtroom that Manafort was disappointed that he did not get a complete hung jury and was not acquitted of all the charges. Manafort was evaluating all his options, Downing said, adding that his client would like to thank Judge Ellis for granting him a fair trial. \nManafort, 69, was found guilty of five counts of falsifying income tax returns, one count of failing to report his foreign bank accounts and two counts of bank fraud. \nThe declaration of a mistrial on the 10 other charges, which include additional charges of bank fraud, bank fraud conspiracy and failure to report foreign accounts, allows the prosecution to retry them with another jury. The prosecution has not yet stated whether it would pursue another trial, and has up until Aug. 29 to decide. \nManafort is scheduled to begin a separate trial on Sept. 17 in a Washington D.C. court. Hes charged in that district with conspiracy against the United States, money laundering, being an unregistered agent of a foreign principal, making false and misleading statements relating to the Foreign Agent Registration Act (FARA), as well as other false statements. Manafort is also charged with conspiracy to obstruct justice and obstruction of justice relating to alleged witness tampering.\nResponding to a reporters question about Manaforts verdict, Trump said it has nothing to do with Russian collusion, and was a continuation of the witch hunt, a term hes repeatedly used to describe Special Counsel Robert Muellers investigation. Trump also called Manafort a good man and noted he worked for Ronald Reagan. \nSources: AP, C-SPAN, VOX, U.S. DOJ 32-count indictment, U.S. DOJ 7-count indictment",

      "Content": "The White House on Friday called a TIME magazine cover that depicted a crying immigrant girl superimposed next to President Donald Trump shameful and a separation from the facts, after the reported father of the girl said she had not been separated from her mother. TIMEs editor-in-chief said the girl had become the most visible symbol of the ongoing immigration debate in America and the cover captured the stakes of the issue. \nLast week, the cover of the July 2 issue of TIME magazine became available online. The cover featured a photograph of a crying two-year old Honduran immigrant girl looking up on one side, and a separate picture of President Donald Trump looking down, both against a red background. It appeared as if Trump and the girl were looking at each other. The cover said, Welcome to America. \nThe cover story is about the effects of the Trump administrations zero-tolerance policy to prosecute all adults who illegally crossed the border. The policy has resulted in more than 2,300 children being separated from their alleged parents, according to U.S. officials, before Trump ordered the separations to stop when appropriate last week. \nOn Thursday, a man in Honduras who said he is the girls father, Denis Hernandez, told The Washington Post that she had not been separated from her mother after crossing the U.S.-Mexico border. He said the mother and girl were detained by border patrol together. \nOn Friday, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders tweeted from her press secretary account, Its shameful that dems and the media exploited this photo of a little girl to push their agenda. She was not separated from her mom. The separation here is from the facts. Trump retweeted Sanders post. \nTIME editor-in-chief Edward Felsenthal responded to criticism of the magazine cover. The June 12 photograph of the 2-year-old Honduran girl became the most visible symbol of the ongoing immigration debate in America for a reason: Under the policy enforced by the administration, prior to its reversal this week, those who crossed the border illegally were criminally prosecuted, which in turn resulted in the separation of children and parents, Felsenthal said. Our cover and our reporting capture the stakes of this moment. \nImmigration policy \nIn April, the Trump administration announced a zero-tolerance policy that set a goal of charging all immigrant adults found illegally crossing the border with federal crimes for illegal entry or attempted entry. Under federal law, children cannot be held in adult jails. Trumps policy has resulted in over 2,300 separations of alien children from accompanying undocumented immigrant adults.\nOn Wednesday, Trump issued an executive order to detain alien families together where appropriate and consistent with law and available resources. The order called for the attorney general to prioritize adjudication of cases involving immigrant families, and to file a court motion challenging the 20-day limit on detainment of undocumented alien children, which had been imposed by judicial interpretations of the so-called Flores settlement.\nOn Thursday, Trump tweeted, \"We must maintain a Strong Southern Border. We cannot allow our Country to be overrun by illegal immigrants as the Democrats tell their phony stories of sadness and grief, hoping it will help them in the elections. Obama and others had the same pictures, and did nothing about it!\"\nThe photograph\nPulitzer Prize-winning Getty photographer John Moore took the original picture of the girl, Yanela, standing next to her mother, Sandra Sanchez, on June 12 in McAllen, Texas. Media outlets, including TIME, CNN and The New York Daily News, used the photo in stories about immigrant child-family separations at the border. \nMoores original caption on the photo said the mother and child were asylum seekers who had rafted across the Rio Grande from Mexico and were detained by U.S. Border Patrol agents before being sent to a processing center for possible separation. The Honduran government said U.S. authorities detained the two at a facility in Texas, and that they had not been separated from each other, according to Reuters.\nMoore said he prefers that his images be used in their original forms and that he was not involved in putting together the TIME cover, according to CNN. He said media outlets can purchase images from Getty and use them in art illustrations.\nThe TIME cover is an illustration that interprets a wider issue being reported on within the magazine, Moore said. The photograph I took is a straightforward and an honest image; it shows a brief moment in time of a distressed little girl, whose mother is being searched as they are both taken into custody. I believe this image has raised awareness of the zero tolerance policy of the current administration. Having covered immigration for Getty Images for 10 years, this photograph for me is part of a much larger story.\"\nTIME magazine published a story about the photo last Tuesday and issued a correction in a later version of the article: \"The original version of this story misstated what happened to the girl in the photo after she was taken from the scene. The girl was not carried away screaming by U.S. Border Patrol agents; her mother picked her up and the two were taken away together.\nDescriptions of what happened\nBorder patrol agent Carlos Ruiz, who was present when officials stopped Sandra and Yanela Sanchez, described to CBS News on Friday morning what he said happened.\nWe asked her to set the kid down in front of her, not away from her  and so we can properly search the mother. So, the kid immediately started crying as [Sanchez] set her down. I personally went up to the mother and asked her, are you doing OK, is the kid OK? and she said, Yes, shes tired and thirsty and its 11 oclock at night, Ruiz said. \nRuiz said border patrol agents care and treat these people as humanely and as best as we possibly can while they do their jobs. \nSanchez husband, Denis Hernandez, said she left Honduras for the U.S. via Mexico without telling him, adding that he had not directly been in contact with her. Hernandez said his wife was looking for a better future, and wanted to experience the American dream and find a job in the U.S., according to The Daily Mail. \nI didn't support it. I asked her, why? Why would she want to put our little girl through that? But it was her decision at the end of the day, Hernandez said. He added that his wife was seeking political asylum, without stating the grounds. He said he had heard from his friends that Sanchez paid $6,000 for a coyote, someone who smuggles people across the border, to help her cross into the U.S., the Daily Mail reported.\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) said Sanchez was deported from the U.S. in 2013. At that time, immigration officials encountered her in Hebbronville, Texas, and she was deported 15 days later under expedited removal.\nHernandez said he had three children with Sanchez who were still in Honduras, ages 14, 11 and six.\nSources: CBC News, CBS News, CNN, Daily Mail, Fox News, The Daily Caller, The Washington Post, TIME\n",

Trump reportedly did not inform McGahn before he made the announcement through his personal Twitter account, according to The New York Times. McGahn has not yet publicly commented on his departure.\nWhite House Counsel Don McGahn will be leaving his position in the fall, shortly after the confirmation (hopefully) of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the United States Supreme Court. I have worked with Don for a long time and truly appreciate his service! Trump tweeted. \nOn Aug. 18, the Times reported that McGahn had cooperated with Special Counsel Robert Muellers investigation into whether the Trump campaign conspired with Russia to influence the 2016 election. The Times noted that McGahns cooperation was part of a decision made by Trumps legal team last September. \nIn a press briefing at the White House on Wednesday, Trump called McGahn an excellent guy and speculated that McGahn may enter the private sector after his departure.\nEarlier Wednesday and prior to Trumps tweet, Axios reported that McGahn would leave after Kavanaughs confirmation or after the midterm election.\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell issued a statement after Trumps announcement, calling McGahn the most impressive White House counsel during his lifetime. His departure from the White House, whenever that may be, would be a big loss for the Trump Administration and the country. Dons significance to the judiciary, the White House and the nation cannot be overstated, and I look forward to his continued efforts on behalf of our country, McConnell added.\nPrior to serving as the White House legal counsel, McGahn represented the Trump campaign through the law firm Jones Day.\n\nSources: Axios, Jones Day, McConnell statement, The New York Times, Trumps tweet, White House press briefing",

Sharifs daughter Maryam Nawaz and her husband Muhammad Safdar were also convicted and sentenced to seven years and one year in prison, respectively. All three deny the charges.\nSharif, 68, and his daughter were tried in absentia, as the family is in London while Sharifs wife receives treatment for cancer, The New York Times and NBC News reported. \nThe National Accountability Bureau (NAB) court sentenced Sharif to 10 years for owning assets beyond his income level and one year for non-cooperation with the NAB, to be served concurrently. The court also fined Sharif $10.6 million, fined his daughter $2.65 million and ordered the seizure of the familys four apartments near Hyde Park, in London, where Sharif was reportedly staying. The judge concluded in a written statement that Sharif had failed to disclose the source of funds used to purchase of the London properties and to report the purchase to tax authorities. \nThe case resulted from disclosures about Sharifs property made in the Panama Papers leak of last year.\nSharif founded the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) party. He has served as Pakistans prime minister three times, from 199093, 199799, and 201317. He was removed from power during a military coup in 1999. Sharif was subsequently charged with terrorism, and later lived in self-imposed exile, before returning to Pakistani politics in 2013. Last year, the Supreme Court ordered him removed from office for failing to report income from a company his son owned. Sharif denies the charges. \nFive months ago, after Sharif was removed from office, the Supreme Court ruled that he was prohibited from holding office for the remainder of his life. Sharif has said the charges against him are politically motivated and that Pakistans military is involved. The military denies it has become involved in civilian politics. \nPakistan is scheduled to hold general elections on July 25. As part of her conviction, Nawaz was prohibited from running, as she had planned.\nSources: AP, Encyclopedia Britannica, NBC News, The New York Times",

Douma had reportedly been held by the militant group Jaish al-Islam, which opposes the Syrian government. \nThe alleged chemical attack occurred on Saturday, killing at least 60 people and wounding more than 1,000 others. According to AP, the opposition group has attributed the attack to Syrian President Bashar Assads forces. The Syrian and Russian governments have denied the allegations.\nSyrias Foreign Ministry said it will help the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) investigate the alleged attack. The OPCWs technical Secretariat has requested that the Syrian government make arrangements for the inspection.\nA Syrian Foreign Ministry spokesperson said, Syria is keen on cooperating with the OPCW to uncover the truth behind the allegations that some Western sides have been advertising to justify their aggressive intentions, according to state news agency SANA. \nThe U.S. has not determined what materials were used in the alleged attack or who may be responsible. President Trump has said the U.S. will respond forcefully once responsibility for the attack is established. The White House said Tuesday that Trump will not travel to the Summit of the Americas in Peru so that he can focus on Syria.\nReuters, citing Russia-based news agency RIA, reported that about 3,600 militants and their families have left Douma over the past 24 hours, surrendering the city to Syrian government forces.\nSources: Reuters, AP",

Thousands of demonstrators were protesting delays in reporting the official results of Mondays election. \nSupporters of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) party damaged signs, stoplights and benches in the city before police fired warning shots and used water cannons and tear gas on the crowds. Protesters also burned tires, threw rocks and blocked streets, The Washington Post reported. \nOn Wednesday morning, President Emmerson Mnangagwa of the ruling ZANU-PF party tweeted, At this crucial time, I call on everyone to desist from provocative declarations and statements. We must all demonstrate patience and maturity, and act in a way that puts our people and their safety first. Now is the time for responsibility and above all, peace.\nMDCs candidate for president, Nelson Chamisa, had declared victory on Tuesday before any announcement of official results.\nPreliminary results\nThe election commission has announced some parliamentary results, including saying that 122 out of 210 seats in the National Assemblys lower house would go to the ZANU-PF party, 53 to MDC, 2 to other parties with 33 not yet declared. The election commission has until Saturday to report the full election results. \nAn announcement on the results for president was not made on Wednesday due to some of the 23 candidates not being present to verify the results, according to BBC.\nVoter turnout on Monday was about 70 percent of the more than five million people registered to vote, BBC reported. If no presidential candidate receives a majority of the votes from Mondays election, there will be a runoff between the top two finishers on Sept. 8.\nElection observers\nElmar Brok, leader of the EUs election observer mission, was critical of the election commissions lack of transparency and some problems around polling stations on voting day. He also said, In some senses, up to this point, the conduct of the polls has had a number of positive features. He said delays in the election commission releasing official results could result in it losing credibility. \nThe EU mission also said there were issues with the vote, including mistrust of the electoral commission, media bias and voter intimidation. The mission added that there was an \"improved political climate, but un-level playing field and lack of trust.\nThe African Union mission said the elections took place in a very peaceful environment and were highly competitive. It said it could not confirm allegations by opposition parties that there was voter intimidation and vote-buying during the election. \nViolence has occurred after elections in Zimbabwe in the past. In 2008, at which point President Robert Mugabe had been in power as prime minister or president for 28 years, the opposition said it had won the presidency. There was then a runoff election, with some supporters of Mugabes government committing violence, and the opposition candidate withdrew.\nMondays election was the first since Robert Mugabe resigned from office last year after a military coup took over the government.\n\nSources: BBC, The Washington Post",

      "Content": "The U.S. Supreme Court ruled Thursday that states can charge sales taxes on online sales from companies that do not have a physical presence in those states. The court ruled 5-4 in the case of South Dakota vs. Wayfair that a 1992 Supreme Court ruling that effectively prohibited such sales tax collections was flawed.\nJustice Anthony Kennedy wrote the majority opinion, saying, \"the Internet's prevalence and power have changed the dynamics of the national economy. The expansion of e-commerce has also increased the revenue shortfall faced by States seeking to collect their sales and use taxes.\" The majority decision also included Justices Samuel Alito, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Neil Gorsuch and Clarence Thomas.\nIn the dissenting opinion, Chief Justice John Roberts wrote, \"E-commerce has grown into a significant and vibrant part of our national economy against the backdrop of established rules, including the physical-presence rule. Any alteration to those rules with the potential to disrupt the development of such a critical segment of the economy should be undertaken by Congress. The minority decision also included Justices Stephen Breyer, Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor.\nLast year e-commerce retail sales were estimated to be $453.5 billion, according to the ruling. Online retail comprises about 9.5 percent of total retail purchases by dollar value, CNN reported. Prohibitions against collecting all sales tax from online retailers in all states cost as much as $13.4 billion in lost tax revenue last year, according to estimates by the General Accountability Office. \nWayfair, which was sued by the state of South Dakota, is an online retailer of home goods that did not have a physical presence there. The South Dakota law applied to sellers that did not have a physical presence in the state and delivered more than $100,000 of goods or services into the state per year, as well as sellers with no physical presence who engaged in at least 200 separate sales transactions for goods and services there. Wayfair qualified for the states sales tax rules under these criteria.\nOnline retailer eBay said taxing internet sales would place \"crushing burdens on small online businesses, causing many to curtail operations and damaging the national economy.\" There are more than 10,000 local taxing jurisdictions across the country, according to NBC News, and sales tax rates can vary from locality to locality within a state. Internet companies have to keep track of all these rates to know which sales tax to charge on each purchase. In states that pass Internet sales tax laws with minimum sales limits, such as South Dakota, certain online sellers could be exempt from paying sales taxes.\nOnline retailer Amazon already collects sales taxes in the 45 states that collect such taxes due to having large enough physical presences there, CNN and NBC News reported.\nAfter the ruling, shares of Amazon (AMZN), Wayfair (W), Etsy (ETSY), Overstock (OSTBP) and eBay (EBAY) fell. \nSources: CNN, NBC News, U.S. Supreme Court",

      "Content": "The Virginia trial of Paul Manafort, a former campaign chairman to President Donald Trump, for alleged financial crimes began on Tuesday. The jury was selected, opening statements were heard and testimony began in a trial the judge said was expected to not last more than three weeks. \n\nThe trial is the first to result from Special Counsel Robert Muellers investigation of alleged Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and related matters, but the charges against Manafort are not related to the alleged interference. One of the prosecutors said, I dont anticipate that a government witness will utter the word Russia during the trial. \nThere are 18 counts against Manafort. The only allegations related to the Trump campaign involved a loan prosecutors say Manafort secured with a bank based on false documents in return for obtaining a position for the banks chairman in the Trump campaign.\nManafort is charged with multiple violations of tax and banking laws in the case in Alexandria, Virginia. Manafort is also scheduled to stand trial in Washington in September on related charges. Prosecutors allege, among other things, that he did not pay taxes on all of the nearly $60 million he reportedly earned from lobbying on behalf of Ukrainian politicians, that he hid foreign bank accounts from U.S. authorities and that he lied to banks to take out more than $20 million in loans, according to CNN. Manafort denies the charges and has pled not guilty to all counts.\nIf found guilty, Manafort could be sentenced to a maximum of 305 years in prison, CNN reported. Manaforts attorneys have filed motions, which were denied, to dismiss the charges against him on the grounds that Mueller did not have authority to investigate him for crimes unrelated to his work on Trumps campaign.\nIn June, a judge revoked Manaforts bail and house arrest privileges after he was charged with obstructing justice and conspiracy to obstruct justice for allegedly attempting to influence potential witnesses in his case between February and April. He pled not guilty to those charges and was taken into custody.\nFormer Trump campaign official Rick Gates, who worked with Manafort prior to joining Trumps campaign, pled guilty to two financial-related charges in February, after initially pleading not guilty to charges in an indictment last October. After Gates pled guilty to the charges in a Washington court, the Mueller team dropped the charges against him in the Virginia case. Gates was on a list of 35 witnesses prosecutors said they could call in the case. Five witnesses have been granted limited immunity to testify in the case, including Manafort accountants.\nLast July, the FBI raided Manaforts residence in Virginia, seizing documents and property. Some of the seized material may be presented as evidence in the case. \nManaforts lawyers wrote the court: \"Evidence or argument relating to Mr. Manafort's work for then-candidate Trump's campaign in 2016 or the Special Counsel's investigation of the campaign's alleged collusion with the Russian government is wholly irrelevant to whether Mr. Manafort's personal income tax returns were false, whether he willfully failed to file reports of foreign accounts, and whether he conspired to commit, or committed, bank fraud.\nThe jury in the case is comprised of six men and six women, the majority of them white, with four alternates, three of whom are women.\nSources: CNN, Fox News, NPR, The New York Times",

      "Content": "Russian President Vladimir Putin and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoan on Monday announced an agreement to establish a demilitarized zone in Idlib province that would be monitored by both Turkish and Russian forces. Russia supports the Syrian government while Turkey has supported militant groups that oppose the Syrian government.\nUnder the agreement, Russia and Turkey would establish a nine to 12.5 mile (15 to 20 km) wide demilitarized zone in Idlib province by Oct. 15. Putin said radical militants, such as the Al Nusra Front, would be withdrawn from the area. The Al Nusra Front is a Syrian division of al-Qaida.\nIn recent weeks, the Syrian government has reportedly sent tens of thousands of armed troops to the area and deployed more than 2,000 armored vehicles, according to the U.K.-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR). The U.N. has said a full-scale military operation on Idlib could risk a humanitarian catastrophe.\nUnder the demilitarized zone agreement, by Oct. 10, heavy military equipment, such as tanks, multiple rocket launchers, cannons and mortars, belonging to all opposition groups would also be withdrawn from the region, according to Putin. The agreement also calls for the reopening of roads connecting the Aleppo-Latakia and Aleppo-Hama routes before the end of 2018.\nRussia and Turkey have reaffirmed their commitment to fight terrorism in Syria in all its forms and guises, Putin said. It is our common opinion that practical efforts to fulfill the planned steps will give an added boost to the political settlement process in Syria, step up work on the Geneva platform and contribute to the return of peace to Syrian soil.\nPutin also said the agreement was generally supported by Syrian leadership, and that Russia would soon hold additional consultations with President Bashar Assads Syrian government.\nErdoan said the demilitarized zone was required to prevent a large humanitarian crisis. The U.N. has said a full-scale military operation on Idlib could risk a humanitarian catastrophe due to the areas estimated population of about 3 million people. \nAccording to the U.N., many Syrian civilians have traveled to Idlib seeking refuge from other conflict zones in the country during Syrias 7-1/2-year-old civil war. About 500,000 people have reportedly arrived in Idlib over the past six months.\nErdoan said that the opposition will continue to stay in the areas they are in, adding, in return, we will ensure that radical groups, which we will designate together with Russia, won't be active in the relevant area. Last month, the U.N. said Idlib Province had about 10,000 Al Nusra or al-Qaida members that it labeled as terrorists. \nErdoan said the goal for Syria was firstly to ensure a constitution is formed, then, democratic elections are held there and finally the Syrian people have their own actual democratic administration. \nWhile Erdoan and Putin did not provide a timeline for establishing a new Syrian constitution or holding democratic elections in the country, Erdoan said they had agreed the accelerate their efforts to finalize the formation of a constitutional committee as soon as possible.\n\n\nSources: Erdogan statement, Putin statement, U.N. statement",

      "Content": "In a press conference on Monday, the White House suggested a pipe bomb attack in New York City would have been prevented if the U.S. didnt have so-called chain migration, something President Trump says he wants to change. The White House suggested the suspect, who came to the U.S. legally in 2011, would not have been able to enter the country if Trumps immigration policies were in place at that time.\nThis isnt the first time Trump or his predecessors have oversimplified the cause of a violent attack while omitting other contributing factors. As youll see below, sometimes U.S. presidents attribute attackers actions to some undescribed evil or hate, a nonspecific mental illness or legislative shortcomings, such as gun or immigration laws. Ultimately, we cant know for sure what motivates someone to attack. At best, we can know the perpetrators stated motive, if provided. Beyond this, we form educated guesses based on criminal profiles and other data.\nNote: The attacks listed below were chosen based on the number of deaths, the media coverage of the event, and whether the president made an official statement or announcement. In cases where the president provided no reason for the attack, we instead included the medias implied reason.\nThe Trump Administration (2017 - present)\nNew York City pipe bomb explosion\nDec. 11, 2017: Akayed Ullah, 27, allegedly detonated a pipe bomb strapped to his body, injuring four people, including himself. According to the White House, Ullah arrived in the U.S. in 2011 on an F-43 family immigrant visa.\n\n\tAttack attributed to: Chain migration.\n\tOfficial response: White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said, The presidents policy has called for an end to chain migration, and if that had been in place that would have prevented this individual from coming to the United States. So the president is aggressively going to continue to push forth responsible immigration reform, and ending chain migration would certainly be a part of that process.\n\nTexas church shooting\nNov. 5, 2017: Devin P. Kelley, 26, shot and killed 26 people and injured 20 others at a Texas church.\n\n\tAttack attributed to: Mental health problems.\n\tOfficial response: Trump said the gunman was a very deranged individual, a lot of problems, adding, We have a lot of mental health problems in our country, as do other countries. But this isnt a gun situation. He said, This is a mental health problem at the highest level.\n\nNew York City truck attack\nOct. 31, 2017: Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov, 29, killed eight people in Lower Manhattan when he drove a truck through a bicycle path, striking cyclists and pedestrians.\n\n\tAttack attributed to: Diversity visa program.\n\tOfficial response: Trump tweeted, The terrorist came into our country through what is called the 'Diversity Visa Lottery Program,' a Chuck Schumer beauty. I want merit based. Trump later said he was going to ask Congress to get rid of the program. The Department of Homeland Security confirmed that Saipov entered the U.S. in 2010 via the diversity visa program.\n\nLas Vegas shooting\nOct. 1, 2017: Stephen Paddock, 64, killed at least 59 people and wounded at least 527 others at a concert in Las Vegas, Nevada.\n\n\tAttack attributed to: Evil.\n\tOfficial response: In a statement, Trump called the attack an act of pure evil and senseless. On Oct. 3, Trump said the U.S. will be talking about gun laws as time goes by, and did not elaborate.\n\nThe Obama Administration (2009  2017)\nFlorida nightclub shooting\nJune 12, 2016: Omar Mateen, 29, killed 49 people at an Orlando, Florida, nightclub.\n\n\tAttack attributed to: Gun access, hate, propaganda.\n\tOfficial response: In a June 16 statement, President Obama said, Here in Orlando, we are reminded not only of our obligations as a country to be resolute against terrorists, we are reminded not only of the need for us to implement smarter policies to prevent mass shootings, we're also reminded of what unites us as Americans, and that what unites us is far stronger than the hate and the terror of those who target us. He added, Whatever the motivations of the killer, whatever influences led him down the path of violence and terror, whatever propaganda he was consuming from ISIL and al Qaeda, this was an act of terrorism but it was also an act of hate.\n\nSan Bernardino shooting\nDec. 2, 2015: Syed Farook, 28, and his wife Tafsheen Malik, 27, shot and killed 14 people and wounded 21 more at a social services center in San Bernardino, California.\n\n\tAttack attributed to: Gun access, self-radicalization possibly inspired by the Islamic State (IS) group.\n\tOfficial response: On Dec. 3, 2015 Obama said the FBI and the DOJ were still determining whether the shooting was terrorist or workplace related. He also said as the investigation progresses, its going to be important for all of us, including our legislatures, to see what we can do to make sure that when individuals decide that they want to do somebody harm, were making it a little harder for them to do it. Because right now its just too easy. And were going to have to, I think, search ourselves as a society to make sure that we can take basic steps that would make it harder, not impossible, but harder, for individuals to get access to weapons. The Los Angeles Times reported that the FBI had concluded the couple were self-radicalized, and that officials said they were inspired by terrorist groups but did not receive financial support from any foreign or domestic organizations.\n\nSandy Hook Shooting\nDec. 14, 2012: Adam Lanza, 20, killed 20 children and six staff members at Sandy Hook Elementary School, after shooting his mother to death while she slept in their Connecticut home.\n\n\tAttack attributed to: Gun access and mental health problems (both implied).\n\tOfficial response: At a vigil for the families affected by the shooting, Obama said, These tragedies must end. And to end them, we must change. We will be told that the causes of such violence are complex, and that is true. No single law, no set of laws can eliminate evil from the world, or prevent every senseless act of violence in our society, adding, In the coming weeks, I will use whatever power this office holds to engage my fellow citizens  from law enforcement to mental health professionals to parents and educators  in an effort aimed at preventing more tragedies like this.\n\nThe Bush Administration (2001  2009)\nVirginia Tech shooting\nApr. 16, 2007: Seung-Hui Cho, 23, killed 32 people on the Virginia Tech campus in Blacksburg, VA.\n\n\tAttack attributed to: No reason stated or implied.\n\tMedias implied reason: Gun access.\n\tOfficial response: In a statement, Bush said, It's impossible to make sense of such violence and suffering. Those whose lives were taken did nothing to deserve their fate. They were simply in the wrong place at the wrong time.\n\n9/11 attack\nSept. 11, 2001: Nineteen people associated with al-Qaeda took control of four commercial airplanes: two of the planes were flown into the twin towers of the World Trade Center in New York City, a third plane hit the Pentagon outside Washington, D.C., and the fourth plane crashed in a field in Pennsylvania. Almost 3,000 people died.\n\n\tAttack attributed to: Terrorism, foreign jealousy of U.S. freedom and opportunity.\n\tOfficial response: In his address, Bush said, America was targeted for attack because we're the brightest beacon for freedom and opportunity in the world. And no one will keep that light from shining. The attack also facilitated military action in Afghanistan and led to legislation such as the Patriot Act, which let law enforcement use surveillance against a broader set of terror related crimes.\n\nThe Clinton Administration (1993  2001)\nColumbine shooting\nApr. 20, 1999: Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, both 18, shot and killed 12 classmates and a teacher, and wounded 24 others at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo.\n\n\tAttack attributed to: Violence, gun access, values, troubled kids.\n\tOfficial response: President Clinton spoke at the school about a month after the shooting, saying, These dark forces that take over people and make them murder are the extreme manifestation of fear and rage with which every human being has to do combat. Speaking to the students, Clinton said, You have provoked Hillary and me and the vice president and Mrs. Gore to reach out across America to launch a national grassroots campaign against violence directed against young people. You can be a part of that. You can give us a culture of values instead of a culture of violence. You can help us to keep guns out of the wrong hands. You can help us to make sure kids who are in trouble, and there will always be some, are identified early and reached and helped. You can help us do this.\n\nOklahoma City bombing\nApr. 19, 1995: Anti-government militant Timothy McVeigh, 27, detonated a truck containing explosives outside the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, leaving 168 people dead and hundreds more injured.\n\n\tAttack attributed to: Evil, paranoia, hate.\n\tOfficial response: On the day of the bombing, Clinton described the attack as an act of cowardice and evil. Five days later, Clinton made additional comments while speaking to the American Association of Community Colleges: We hear so many loud and angry voices in America today whose sole goal seems to be to try to keep some people as paranoid as possible and the rest of us all torn up and upset with each other. They spread hate. They leave the impression that, by their very words, that violence is acceptable. Clinton continued, I'm sure you are now seeing the reports of some things that are regularly said over the airwaves in America today. Well, people like that who want to share our freedoms must know that their bitter words can have consequences, and that freedom has endured in this country for more than two centuries because it was coupled with an enormous sense of responsibility.\n",

      "Content": "At a private fundraiser on Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump reportedly said that he had told Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau during a meeting that the prime ministers statements on the trade balance between the two countries were wrong. Trump added that, I didnt even know I had no idea. Trump said he then asked an aide to get information about the trade balance. \nTrump said the aide told him the U.S. did not have a trade deficit with Canada, when excluding energy and timber. Trump said he told Trudeau that the U.S. had a deficit of $17 billion per year when including those sectors. \nThe Washington Post first reported on Trumps comments, citing an audio recording it said it had obtained of the event. The outlet reported that Trump made the comments while talking for half an hour at a private fundraising event for Josh Hawley, a Republican Senate candidate from Missouri. Hawley is running against Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.).\nAccording to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, in 2016 the U.S. had a trade surplus with Canada of $12.5 billion, when taking goods and services together. In the same year, when evaluating trade of goods only, the U.S. had a trade deficit with Canada of $12.1 billion. \nWhite House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the U.S. Trade Representatives figures were incomplete and did not include timber and energy.\nOn Thursday, Trump tweeted, We do have a Trade Deficit with Canada, as we do with almost all countries (some of them massive). P.M. Justin Trudeau of Canada, a very good guy, doesnt like saying that Canada has a Surplus vs. the U.S.(negotiating), but they do...they almost all do...and thats how I know!\nAt the fundraiser, Trump also reportedly talked about trade with other countries including the EU, China, Japan, South Korea and Mexico. He also mentioned the House special election in Pennsylvania and his agreement to meet with Kim Jong Un, leader of North Korea.\nTrumps reported comments\nTrump also said at the fundraiser, according to the Post, Trudeau came to see me. Hes a good guy, Justin. He said, No, no, we have no trade deficit with you, we have none. Donald, please, Nice guy, good-looking guy, comes in  Donald, we have no trade deficit. Hes very proud because everybody else, you know, were getting killed.\n... So, hes proud. I said, Wrong, Justin, you do. I didnt even know. ... I had no idea. I just said, Youre wrong. You know why? Because were so stupid.  And I thought they were smart. I said, Youre wrong, Justin. He said, Nope, we have no trade deficit. I said, Well, in that case, I feel differently, I said, but I dont believe it. I sent one of our guys out, his guy, my guy, they went out, I said, Check, because I cant believe it. Well, sir, youre actually right. We have no deficit, but that doesnt include energy and timber.  And when you do, we lose $17 billion a year. Its incredible.\nSources: CNN, The Washington Post",

      "Content": "On Tuesday, the U.S. released a finalized list of approximately $200 billion worth of Chinese imports that would be subject to additional tariffs, scheduled to go into effect on Sept. 24. The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) said the initial tariffs would start at 10 percent and increase to 25 percent on Jan. 1, 2019. \nThe tariff proposal was previously announced by President Donald Trump at a White House briefing on Monday.\nThe goods subject to the tariffs include pork products, seafood, produce, audio equipment, bicycle products and various types of furniture, according to the USTR list. Certain products are exempted from the tariffs, including: consumer electronics products, such as smart watches and Bluetooth devices; some chemical products for manufactured goods; and some health and safety products, such as bicycle helmets and child car seats.\nThe tariffs were in response to an investigation by the USTR published earlier this year that said, the acts, policies, and practices of the Government of China related to technology transfer, intellectual property, and innovation covered in the investigation are unreasonable or discriminatory and burden or restrict U.S. commerce.\nThe USTR said China has been unwilling to change its policies involving the unfair acquisition of U.S. technology and intellectual property. According to the USTR, rather than change its policies, China responded to U.S. tariffs by taking further steps to harm U.S. workers and businesses. In July and August of this year, China imposed retaliatory tariffs on U.S. imports.\nOn Tuesday, China responded to the U.S. tariffs by imposing tariffs on $60 billion worth of U.S. imports, which would also take effect on Sept. 24. The tariffs would range from five to 10 percent. Chinas announcement did not include a list of goods that would receive tariffs. A previous list of tariffed goods from China had included products such as coffee, honey and industrial chemicals, Deutsche Welle reported. \nTo protect its legitimate rights and interests and order in international free trade, China is left with no choice but to retaliate simultaneously, China's Commerce Ministry said on Tuesday.\nDuring Mondays tariff announcement, and prior to Chinas response, Trump had said that if China took retaliatory action against our farmers or other industries, the U.S. would impose a new round of tariffs on approximately $267 billion of additional imports. He did not provide a date for their implementation.\nTrump tweeted Monday, Tariffs have put the U.S. in a very strong bargaining position, with billions of dollars, and jobs, flowing into our country - and yet cost increases have thus far been almost unnoticeable. If countries will not make fair deals with us, they will be Tariffed!\nThe Associated Press reported in a fact check on Trumps tweet that the impact of the tariffs on employment is unknown given that the U.S. economy had been adding jobs prior to the tariff increases. The Treasury Department reported that it had a $5.4 billion increase in customs and duties collection so far this fiscal year, AP reported. AP attributed some of the increase to more goods being imported to the U.S.. Customs and duties account for about 1.2 percent of overall federal revenues, according to AP. \nThe Institute of Supply Management (ISM), a not-for-profit association, recently issued a survey of manufacturing companies. ISM chair Timothy Fiore said survey respondents were overwhelmingly concerned about tariff-related activity, including how reciprocal tariffs will impact company revenue and current manufacturing locations. Panelists are actively evaluating how to respond to these business changes, given the uncertainty.\n\nSources: AP, DW, ISM, Tariff list, USTR announcement, White House statement",

Mattarella also approved a list of cabinet ministers from Conte. Conte withdrew his bid for prime minister last week after Mattarella had appointed him and rejected Contes nominee for finance minister.\nMattarella had appointed Carlo Cottarelli, a former official at the International Monetary Fund, to form an interim government earlier this week until a coalition government could be formed. Cottarelli resigned as interim prime minister for Conte to become prime minister. Conte has no political experience and is a law professor who lives in Florence. \nThe new government will be comprised of a coalition between the League and the Five Star Movement parties, which formed after March 4 parliamentary elections. It is the longest amount of time it has taken to form a government after elections in the post-World War II-era, according to CNN.\nThe new government could be sworn in on Friday and could hold a confidence vote in parliament, possibly next week.\nConte had originally chosen Paolo Savona as finance minister. Savona, 81, has called Italys decision to adopt the euro as its currency a historic error. Mattarella rejected Savonas nomination, saying there would be too much variation in economic markets if he were finance minister. \nContes new cabinet is to be composed of economics professor Giovanni Tria as finance minister. Luigi Di Maio, leader of the Five Star Movement, would become industry and labor minister, and Matteo Salvini, leader of the League, would become interior minister. Di Maio and Salvini would also be deputy prime ministers. Savona would become minister of European affairs. \nOther new ministers include: Enzo Moavero Milanesi as foreign minister, Elisabetta Trenta as defense minister, Alfonso Bonafede as justice minister, and Giulia Grillo as health minister.\nSources: BBC, CNN, The Telegraph",

      "Content": "President Donald Trump held an immigration roundtable discussion on Tuesday about the gang known as MS-13, in which he mentioned the need for more border control legislation. Media articles describe the gang as violent, yet many omit specific information about the gang, its origins, what it does and the degree to which the gang is a potential threat to U.S. residents.\nThis context will look at what MS-13 is, its creation, what it does and how the U.S. has responded to it. (The potential reasons for why gangs like MS-13 exist and what social structures may contribute to their development is beyond the scope of this piece.) \nWhat is MS-13?\nMS-13 is a criminal organization with members in various countries, including the U.S. The FBI defines a gang as an association of three or more individuals with a collective identity that the groups use to create an atmosphere of fear or intimidation.\nMS-13 is short for La Mara Salvatrucha. Mara is the term used for gang, and Salvatrucha is a combination of the words Salva and trucha. Salva is an abbreviation for Salvadoran, and trucha (literally meaning trout) is a slang term for alert, look out, or cunning. The 13 refers to the thirteenth letter of the alphabet, or M, which denotes the gangs alleged ties to a prison gang called the Mexican Mafia.\nIoan Grillo, author of Gangster Warlords, said the term Mara comes from a movie title. A 1950s-era Charlton Heston movie called The Naked Jungle, which was popular in El Salvador, was translated as Cuando Ruge la Marabunta\" or When the Ants Roar. Grillo said Salvadorans took the name Mara to refer to a group of friends, who protect each other like ants. The group started in Los Angeles as heavy metal music enthusiasts who called themselves the Mara Stoners. By 1984, the Mara Stoners rebranded as Mara Salvatrucha to incorporate their Salvadoran origins. After several members went to jail in Los Angeles, they aligned themselves with the Mexican Mafia and became MS-13.\nWhen was MS-13 created?\nThe gang was established in L.A. in the 1980s by El Salvadoran immigrants who fled civil war in their home country. The migrants settled in California in neighborhoods that already had gang activity. Some Salvadoran immigrants eventually joined gangs such as the Barrio 18, started by Mexican immigrants, before establishing MS-13.\nWhats the scope of its U.S. operation?\nAlthough official numbers may vary, the DOJ estimates MS-13s worldwide membership to be about 30,000, with about 10,000 members in the U.S. In addition to Los Angeles, law enforcement officials have noted the gangs presence in Alaska, Connecticut, Florida, New York, Virginia and the Washington D.C. metropolitan area, among other areas. MS-13 includes members from Honduras, El Salvador, Mexico, Guatemala and the U.S. They reportedly recruit minors and other immigrants.\nThe FBI estimated that the U.S has a total of about 33,000 street, motorcycle and prison gangs with approximately 1.4 million members considered criminally active. \nWhat crimes has MS-13 been associated with?\nThe crime the FBI attributes to MS-13 members include murder, assault, racketeering, robbery, human trafficking, drug trafficking, prostitution, property damage and weapons smuggling. Below are some of the recent documented examples of MS-13-linked crimes:\n\n\tJan. 2018: A teenaged female MS-13 member is convicted of fatally stabbing another girl in Virginia. \n\tNov. 2017: A MS-13 leader in Massachusetts was convicted of racketeering.\n\tAug. 2017: Five suspects allegedly connected to MS-13 were arrested for a 2015 murder of man in Washington. \n\tMar. 2017: At least a dozen members of the MS-13 gang were indicted on seven killings on Long Island spanning three years.\n\tFeb. 2015: Three MS-13 members or associates were arrested for human trafficking in Fairfax County, Virginia.\n\tDec. 2014: MS-13 members allegedly wrote a cop will be killed New Years on the wall of a gas station in Rogers, Arkansas.\n\tFeb. 2011: Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials indicted 11 MS-13 members for murders, stabbings, assaults, robberies and drug distribution.\n\nWhat actions has law enforcement taken against gangs in general?\nIn the late 1980s, the Los Angeles police department began Operation Hammer to increase law enforcement of suspected gang members. The operation included mass arrests and raids. \nAccording to The Atlantic, the U.S. began increasing deportations of convicted immigrants in the 1990s, during the Clinton administration. Insight Crime estimated that about 20,000 people were sent back to Central America between 2000 and 2004 as part of the deportation initiative.\nWhat actions has law enforcement taken against MS-13?\nIn 2012, the U.S. Treasury Department designated MS-13 as a transnational criminal organization (TCO). The Treasury said MS-13 had been involved in serious transnational criminal activities, including drug trafficking, kidnapping, human smuggling, sex trafficking, murder, assassinations, racketeering, blackmail, extortion and immigration offenses. The TCO designation allowed the U.S. to target the gangs international associates and financial networks. \nIn 2016, the Treasury sanctioned two alleged MS-13 leaders: Salvadoran nationals Jos Roberto Orellana and Dany Balmore Romero Garca. The sanctions froze all U.S.-based assets controlled by the two men.\nA 2017 DOJ memo concluded: Through the combined efforts of federal, state, and local law enforcement, great progress was made diminishing or severely disrupt[ing] the gang within certain targeted areas of the US by 2009 and 2010. It didnt provide specifics about what the efforts were. \nThe Trump administration has continued to make arrests of alleged MS-13 members. For example, in 2017, the Department of Homeland Security arrested 796 MS-13 members and associates, and U.S. Border Patrol agents arrested 228 people affiliated with MS-13.\n",

Heres a breakdown of its various measures. \nThe bill....\n\n\tChanges the seven income tax bracket rates and income limits through 2025, at which point theyd revert back to current values if no legislation were passed in the interim.

According to theBrookings Institute, Pass-throughs include S-corporations (those that have shareholders), partnerships, and sole proprietorships. In 2014, there were 26 million registered businesses in total, and about 95 percent of them were pass-throughs.\nBrookings makes the distinction that small businesses are those with less than $10 million in yearly receipts. In 2014, 81 percent of profits in pass-through businesses were made by businesses with more than $10 million of total receipts, which represented one percent of all firms. Pass-through businesses represent a larger fraction of business income now than they have in the past. In 2013, C-corporations, i.e., non-pass-through businesses, earned 44 percent of business income.",

      "Content": "On Sunday, the Fox network aired a new episode of The Simpsons television show titled, No Good Read Goes Unpunished. During the episode, the show addressed recent criticism regarding a character named Apu Nahasapeemapetilon.\nApu is an Indian character who owns a convenience store. In a 2017 documentary titled The Problem with Apu, Indian-American comedian Hari Kondabolu criticized the characters portrayal of South Asians and referred to Apus portrayal on the show as racist. \nSundays episode\nAt one point in Sundays episode of The Simpsons, Marge Simpson reads her daughter, Lisa, a book from Marges childhood called, The Princess in the Garden. Marge revises the book to modernize it  for example, she replaces the main character who has many native servants with a cisgender girl who fights for wild horse rescue and net neutrality. After doing so, Marge says the story is as inoffensive as a Sunday in Cincinnati.\nIn response, Lisa says it sounds like [the revised main character] starts out pretty perfect, adding, since shes already evolved, she doesnt really have an emotional journey to complete. Marge replies, Nope. Lisa continues, Kinda means theres no point to the book. Marge responds by saying, Well, what am I supposed to do? Lisa says, Its hard to say. Something that started decades ago and was applauded and inoffensive is now politically incorrect. What can you do? The cartoon then shows a photo next to Lisas bed of Apu, signed with the words Dont have a cow, Apu.\nMarge then says, Some things will be dealt with at a later date, to which Lisa replies, if at all. The two then look at the audience.\nThe documentary\nIn the documentary, Kondabolu said he didnt hate the show and that he actually always loved it. He told USA Today before his documentarys premiere that Apus character is funny. It has nothing to do with the character being funny, (but at the same time) its insulting, its inaccurate and it represents a larger problem where people dont get to speak for themselves. On the TruTV website for the documentary, it calls Apu a stereotypical character.\nApu is voiced by white actor Hank Azaria, who said after Kondabolus documentary last year that he thought it made some really interesting points and gave us a lot at The Simpsons to think about and we really are thinking about it. He added, definitely anybody that was hurt or offended by it, by any character or vocal ... performance, is (sic) really upsetting that that was offensive or hurtful to anybody. Azaria declined to be interviewed in the documentary.\nResponse to Sundays episode \nAfter the show, Kondabolu tweeted, Wow. Politically Incorrect? Thats the takeaway from my movie  why this is important. The Simpsons response tonight is not a jab at me, but at what many of us consider progress.\nOthers also tweeted criticism of the show. After Sundays episode, stand-up comedian W. Kamau Bell tweeted, The Simpsons, 1989 - 2018 #RIP, and, I think the fact that they put this argument in the mouth of Lisa's character, the character who usually champions the underdogs and is supposed to be the most thoughtful and liberal, is what makes this the most ridiculous (as in worthy of ridicule) and toothless response. Kondabolu had appeared on FXs Totally Biased With W. Kamau Bell in 2012, and did a routine about Apu on the show. \nOne of The Simpsons writers, Al Jean, tweeted before the show, New Simpsons in five minutes. Twitter explosion in act three. \nSome tweeted support for the show. A self-described Indian Twitter user tweeted, Loved how you guys handled this non-issue. People just want to cry about everything nowadays b/c it makes them feel like theyre doing something. Dont ever change! Jean retweeted the post. \nOne twitter user named Henry wrote, Every character is a stereotype. Homer is an overweight, beer-drinking, dumb American, Marge is a housewife, Bart is a stereotypical boy, Lisa is a stereotypical girl, Mr. Burns is a white, old, money obsessed CEO, Cheif Wiggium (sic) is an overweight, donut-eating lazy cop etc.\nSources: BBC, The New York Times, TIME, USA Today",

      "Content": "On Monday, a U.S. federal judge ordered the government to temporarily pause any deportations of migrant families reunited after being separated as a result of the Trump administrations previous zero-tolerance policy on immigration. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), representing migrants in a class-action suit, had requested the delays citing rumors of mass deportations. \nDistrict Court Judge Dana Sabraw ordered a one week temporary delay on deportations until the Department of Justice (DOJ) could file a response. DOJ attorneys oppose stopping deportations, The Associated Press reported. \nThe ACLU said in a court filing that there are persistent and increasing rumors that mass deportations may be carried out imminently and immediately upon reunification, and requested a one week stay between reunification and deportation. The organization said parents who would be deported need time to decide whether to leave their children in the U.S. to seek asylum. \nThis decision cannot be made until parents not only have had time to fully discuss the ramifications with their children, but also to hear from the childs advocate or counsel, the ACLU said. The advocate can explain to the parent the likelihood of the child ultimately prevailing in his or her own asylum case if left behind in the U.S. (as well as where the child is likely to end up living). \nIn June, Sabraw ordered families to be reunited by July 5 and July 24, for minors under five years of age and those over five years, respectively. The DOJ and Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) said they would not be able to make the deadline due to logistical issues and requested an extension, which the court denied on July 6.\nThe Trump administrations zero-tolerance policy announced in April resulted in adults and minors being separated because the policy called for all adults found illegally crossing the border to be charged with federal crimes for illegal entry or attempted entry. Under federal law, minors cannot be held in adult criminal detention centers, so children were separated from the adults accompanying them. During the zero-tolerance policy, under 3,000 children were separated from their parents who illegally entered the U.S., according to the HHS. \nOn June 20, Trump signed an executive order to end the practice of separating children and to, instead, detain families together when deemed appropriate. The order directed the DOJ to file a request with a federal court to modify the Flores settlement, which in accordance with a 2016 court ruling prohibited immigrant accompanied and unaccompanied children from being detained for more than 20 days. The executive order directed the DOJ to request this time be extended, so that immigrant families could be detained together while waiting for immigration proceedings. On July 10, a federal court ruled against increasing the time limit. \nSources: AP, CNN",

      "Content": "Last Wednesday, Recode published an interview in which Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg discussed Facebooks policies for removing content from its site. He said, The principles that we have on what we remove from the service are: If its going to result in real harm, real physical harm, or if youre attacking individuals, then that content shouldnt be on the platform. He also said content that fact checkers identified as false would be given decreased priority in the sites News Feed to limit its distribution.\nA week before the interview, Facebook confirmed it would allow Infowars to keep its page on the site, saying its page did not violate the platforms community standards. Infowars is a media outlet run by Alex Jones that promotes conspiracy theories, such as reporting that the 2012 Sandy Hook school shooting was possibly a hoax. Infowars had about 914,000 Facebook followers as of Sunday night. \nThe interview\nIn the interview, journalist Kara Swisher asked Zuckerberg to make a case for and against keeping Infowars on Facebook. \nZuckerberg responded, There are really two core principles at play here. Theres giving people a voice, so that people can express their opinions. Then, theres keeping the community safe, which I think is really important. Were not gonna let people plan violence or attack each other or do bad things. Within this, those principles have real trade-offs and real tug on each other. In this case, we feel like our responsibility is to prevent hoaxes from going viral and being widely distributed.\nHe continued, The approach that weve taken to false news is not to say, you cant say something wrong on the internet. I think that that would be too extreme. Everyone gets things wrong, and if we were taking down peoples accounts when they got a few things wrong, then that would be a hard world for giving people a voice and saying that you care about that. But at the same time, I think that we have a responsibility to, when you look at if you look at the top hundred things that are going viral or getting distribution on Facebook within any given day, I do think we have a responsibility to make sure that those arent hoaxes and blatant misinformation.\nZuckerberg also said, We look at the things that are getting the most distribution. If people have flag[ged] them as potential hoaxes, we send those to fact-checkers who are all well reputable (sic) and have followed standard principles for fact checking, and if those fact checkers say that it is provably false, then we will significantly reduce the distribution of that content.\nZuckerberg went on to say, Im not defending any specific content here. I think a lot of the content thats at play is terrible. I think when you get into discussions around free speech, youre often talking at the margins of content that is terrible and what should ... but defending peoples right to say things even if they can be bad.\nSwisher then said stories that say Sandy Hook did not happen are false, and asked, You cant just take that down?\nZuckerberg agreed they were false and said, I also think that going to someone who is a victim of Sandy Hook and telling them, Hey, no, youre a liar  that is harassment, and we actually will take that down. \nHe then said, Im Jewish, and theres a set of people who deny that the Holocaust happened. He added, I find that deeply offensive. But at the end of the day, I dont believe that our platform should take that down because I think there are things that different people get wrong. I dont think that theyre intentionally getting it wrong.\nSwisher said, In the case of the Holocaust deniers, they might be, but go ahead.\nZuckerberg continued, Its hard to impugn intent and to understand the intent. I just think, as abhorrent as some of those examples are, I think the reality is also that I get things wrong when I speak publicly. Im sure you do. Im sure a lot of leaders and public figures we respect do too, and I just dont think that it is the right thing to say, Were going to take someone off the platform if they get things wrong, even multiple times.\nHe said, What we will do is well say, Okay, you have your page, and if youre not trying to organize harm against someone, or attacking someone, then you can put up that content on your page, even if people might disagree with it or find it offensive. But that doesnt mean that we have a responsibility to make it widely distributed in News Feed.\nOther Facebook statements on its content policies\nIn 2009, some people criticized Facebook for allowing anti-Semitic pages. Facebook said at the time, We want to be a place where people can discuss all kinds of ideas, including controversial ones.\nLast Tuesday, Facebooks global head of policy management Monika Bickert testified before Congress on the companys content filtering policies. Bickert said there is a certain threshold of violations that must be met before Facebook would remove pages from its site. She said, That threshold varies, depending on the severity of different types of violations. Some lawmakers at the hearing requested that Facebook ban more accounts from its site, including Infowars.\nLast Wednesday, Facebook also said in a statement, Reducing the distribution of misinformationrather than removing it outrightstrikes the right balance between free expression and a safe and authentic community. There are certain forms of misinformation that have contributed to physical harm, and we are making a policy change which will enable us to take that type of content down.\nThe company said it would work with unnamed local groups in Sri Lanka and Myanmar to determine which posts could possibly contribute to violence there. In March, Sri Lanka blocked Facebook for three days following violence against Muslims. The Guardian reported that Facebook posts had spread misinformation about the Muslim community there. In Myanmar, there has been violence against Rohingya Muslims.\nFacebook provided an example of some posts in Sri Lanka that alleged that Muslims were poisoning Buddhists food. A local group informed Facebook that it believed the posts could lead to violence, and the company removed them. Facebook said it will consider the possibility of implementing such a policy in the U.S. and elsewhere in the future.\nWhen asked in Wednesdays interview about his feelings about the possible role Facebook has played in killings in Myanmar, Zuckerberg said, People use tools for good and bad, but I think that we have a clear responsibility to make sure that the good is amplified and to do everything we can to mitigate the bad.\nResponse to Zuckerbergs comments\nChief Executive of the Anti-Defamation League Jonathan Greenblatt said Holocaust denial is a willful, deliberate and longstanding deception tactic by anti-Semites. He added, Facebook has a moral and ethical obligation not to allow its dissemination.\nBenjy Sarlin of NBC News tweeted, So apparently Mark Zuckerberg is under the impression there's some good faith debate going on over whether the Holocaust happened?\nZuckerbergs post-interview clarification\nZuckerberg wrote in a follow up email, theres one thing I want to clear up. I personally find Holocaust denial deeply offensive, and I absolutely didnt intend to defend the intent of people who deny that.\nHe said, Our goal with fake news is not to prevent anyone from saying something untrue  but to stop fake news and misinformation spreading across our services. If something is spreading and is rated false by fact checkers, it would lose the vast majority of its distribution in News Feed. And of course if a post crossed [the] line into advocating for violence or hate against a particular group, it would be removed. These issues are very challenging but I believe that often the best way to fight offensive bad speech is with good speech.\nSources: CNN, Engadget, Recode, The Guardian, The New York Times, The Verge",

      "Content": "On Friday, a U.S. federal judge denied the Department of Justices (DOJ) request for an extension to a court-ordered deadline to reunite migrant parents with their children after officials separated them after they crossed the U.S.-Mexico border. Last week, Federal Judge Dana Sabraw ordered that children under five years old must be reunited with their parents by July 10, and older children must be reunited by July 26. The injunction applies to families separated both before and after the Trump administrations zero-tolerance policy that was implemented in May. \nBy Friday, all of the parents had spoken to their children by phone, in accordance with the court order, The Washington Post reported.\nThe court documents filed by the government said the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), which oversees the housing of the separated children, may not be able to complete the additional processes within the timelines the Court prescribed, particularly with regard to class members who are already not in Government custody, (e.g., because they have previously been paroled or released). \nThe DOJ documents describe the governments work, which consists of collecting information from the Departments of Homeland Security and HHS, verifying each childs parentage (including with DNA testing), and determining the parents \"fitness\" to receive custody of their children. \nOfficials were working nights and weekends to review files and conduct DNA tests, the court filing said. The document said that some tests for parentage were inconclusive, slowing the process of matching parents with their children.\nThe Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency has run approximately 300 background checks, which include criminal and immigration histories, and has 1,400 more to complete.\nThe court filings said officials have identified 101 children under five years old who were separated from their parents, and that they have located 40 of their parents in federal immigration custody and nine parents with U.S. marshals.\nRobert Guadian, acting deputy assistant director of ICEs enforcement and removal operations, said the reunification process was difficult and time consuming. He said ICE does not track whether the adults it detains for deportation have been separated from any children they may have, and the agency has to check with two other agencies to reunite families. Guadian also said the parents of the children under the age of five housed in HHS facilities are being detained in 23 immigration detention facilities across 13 states.\nAccording to HHS Secretary Alex Azar, fewer than 3,000 children were separated from their parents and the government knows the location and identities of all minors under HHS care.\nSources: NPR, The Washington Post",

The Interior Ministry said 153 people were safely evacuated from the hotel.\nAfghanistans Interior Ministry spokesperson Najib Danish said the attackers entered the hotel through the kitchen at 9 p.m. local time Saturday night. He said initial investigations indicated someone inside had helped them gain access, adding that the investigations were still ongoing. \nThe Interior Ministry also stated that the Haqqani network was responsible for the attack. According to CNN, this group seeks to re-establish Taliban rule in Afghanistan.\nBoth foreigners and Afghani officials reportedly stay at the Intercontinental hotel. The hotel has been attacked before; a 2011 incident killed 18 people, including all seven assailants. That attack was also claimed by the Taliban.\nSources: AP, CNN",

      "Content": "South Korean President Moon Jae-in met North Korean leader Kim Jong-un on Friday, starting at 9:30 a.m. local time at the Panmunjom Military Demarcation Line in the demilitarized zone between the two countries. The leaders plan to meet at the Souths Peace House for talks, which are to include the topics of peace and denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, according to South Korean Chief of Staff Im Jong-seok, who heads the summit preparation committee.\nFormer South Korean Presidents Kim Dae-jung and Roh Moo-hyun visited North Korea while in office. According to The Korea Times, no North Korean leader has visited South Korea since fighting in the Korean War ended in 1953. The countries signed an armistice at the time; they have not signed an official peace treaty. \nThe agenda\nA welcoming ceremony is planned that would include an inspection of South Koreas honor guard. The two delegations will have lunch separately before Moon and Kim plant a pine tree together. A monument with Moon and Kims signatures on it and the words planting peace and prosperity will be placed next to the tree. The two leaders will meet for dinner on the third floor of the Peace House after talks.\nThe two leaders are then to sign an agreement and announce it. Im said, where and how the announcement will be made will depend on the content of the agreement. Im also said, I think the summit will be considered successful if we can clearly put into words North Koreas clear intention to denuclearize.\nThe delegations\nKims delegation is to include his sister, Kim Yo-jong; the North Korean ceremonial head of state, Kim Yong-nam; Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho; Minister of the Peoples Armed Forces Pak Yong-sik; Chief of the General Staff of the Korean Peoples Army Ri Myong-su; and Chairman of North Koreas Committee for Peaceful Reunification Ri Son-gwon. Kims wife, Ri Sol-ju, has not been confirmed as attending, according to Im.\nMoons delegation is to include Im; South Korean National Security Office Chief Chung Eui-yong; National Intelligence Service Director Suh Hoon; Unification Minister Cho Myoung-gyon; Defense Minister Song Yong-moo; Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha; and Chief of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Jeong Kyeong-doo.\nEvents leading to the meeting\nOn Saturday, North Korea said it would suspend its nuclear weapons tests, and its intermediate-range and intercontinental ballistic missile tests. The country is under U.N. sanctions for past tests, including a nuclear test in September and an intercontinental ballistic missile test in November of last year.\nSome countries have held talks with North Korea in the past to negotiate an end to its nuclear weapons program. In 2009, North Korea withdrew from Six-Party Talks that included South Korea, China, the United States, Japan and Russia. In February 2012, Kim agreed to suspend the Norths long-range missile and nuclear tests, as well as uranium enrichment, according to the U.S. State Department. In January 2013, North Korea said it planned to conduct long-range missile and nuclear tests again.\nAfter the meeting\nPresident Donald Trump is scheduled to meet with Kim in late May or early June, according to the White House. Mike Pompeo, confirmed Thursday as secretary of state, met with Kim over Easter weekend.\n\nSources: AP, The Korea Herald, The Korea Times, The Washington Post, U.S. State Department",

      "Content": "In a court filing on Monday, the government said 463 parents of migrant children were no longer present in the U.S., and their cases were under review. The filing also said the government had reunited 879 children with their parents so far, and another 538 parents had been cleared for reunions. The filing said 917 parents, including the 463 that may have been deported without their children, were either not eligible or not yet determined to be eligible to be reunited with their children.\nOn June 26, U.S. District Judge Dana Sabraw in San Diego issued a preliminary injunction ordering the government to reunite all separated migrant children with their parents by this Thursday. Then last week Sabraw ordered the government to temporarily suspend deportations of reunited families and requested it update the court as to how many of the parents of the more than 2,500 separated children in the U.S. were no longer in the country. \nSome of the separations resulted from the Trump administrations zero-tolerance policy, announced in April, which called for all adults who illegally crossed the border to be prosecuted. President Donald Trump later signed an executive order to end the separations on June 20, ordering authorities to detain alien families together where appropriate and consistent with law and available resources. \nThe American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) requested that the government provide the court, by the end of the day Tuesday, with a list of migrant parents who had signed a form giving their consent for the government to deport them without their children. The ACLU said in its court filing that migrant parents urgently need consultations with lawyers, so that they do not mistakenly strand their children in the U.S. ACLU lawyer Stephen Kang said, We have concerns about misinformation given to these parents about their rights to fight deportation without their children. \nThe government said all of the migrant parents who it deported had given written consent that they were informed of their rights in their native language.\nSome parents with criminal records or who are deemed to be unfit may not be eligible to be reunited with their children. Before reuniting families, the government: confirms familial relationships through DNA testing, performs background checks for criminal records, assesses the parents fitness to care for their children, and asks parents if they want to be reunited with their children. About 130 parents have opted not to be reunited, The Washington Post reported. \nSources: Reuters, The Washington Post",

      "Content": "Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said Thursday the U.S. would let its temporary steel and aluminum tariff waivers for the EU, Canada and Mexico expire at midnight. The expiration would result in the U.S. imposing a tariff of 25 percent on steel and of 10 percent on aluminum starting Friday. The EU said it would react in a proportionate  manner. Mexico said it would impose equivalent measures. Canada announced tariffs on U.S. imports to begin July 1. \nThe EU said it would bring legal proceedings against the U.S. to the World Trade Organization (WTO). It also said, The level of tariffs to be applied [on U.S. imports] will reflect the damage caused by the new U.S. trade restrictions on E.U. products. The EU had previously said it would respond to U.S. metal tariffs with 25 percent tariffs on U.S. products such as cigarettes, cranberry juice, denim, motorcycles and peanut butter.\nCanada announced it would impose dollar-for-dollar tariffs on steel, aluminum and other goods imported from the U.S. at rates of 25 and 10 percent, beginning July 1. It said the tariffs would apply to imports worth 16.6 billion Canadian dollars ($12.8 billion), which is the value of Canadian steel and aluminum exports to the U.S. last year. Canadian Minister of Foreign Affairs Chrystia Freeland said the tariffs would remain in place until the U.S. removed its tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum. She said Canada would legally challenge the U.S. tariffs at the WTO and under NAFTA.\nMexicos Ministry of Economy said, Faced with tariffs imposed by the U.S., Mexico will impose equivalent measures on various products such as flat steel (hot and cold laminate, including coated and various tubes), lamps, pork legs and shoulders, sausages and food preparations, apples, grapes, blueberries, various cheeses, among others, up to an amount comparable to the level of affectation.\nThe U.S. imposed the metal tariffs under a 1962 law that allows it to do so when it is in the interest of national security. The U.S. exempted Canada, Mexico and the EU until April 30, while it imposed the tariffs on other countries on March 23. It later renewed those exemptions until June 1.\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said, Canada is a secure supplier of aluminum and steel to the U.S. defense industry, putting aluminum in American planes and steel in American tanks. That Canada could be considered a national security threat to the United States is inconceivable.\nRoss said, We take the view that without a strong economy, you cant have strong national security. Ross also said the tariffs proposed by its trade partners in response to the U.S.s aluminum and steel tariffs would amount to a fraction of one percent of the U.S.s $18 trillion economy.\nTariffs between the U.S., Canada and Mexico had been under discussion as part of NAFTA renegotiations. Ross said those negotiations are taking longer than we hoped. He also said the U.S. look[s] forward to continued trade negotiations, both with Canada and Mexico on the one hand and with the European Commission on the other hand, because there are other issues that we also need to get resolved.\nThe U.S. had previously granted metal tariff exemptions to Argentina, Australia and Brazil. The U.S. has reached deals with those countries to impose quotas on metal imports from them, The New York Times reported.\nSources: AP, CNBC, CNN, Department of Finance Canada, Global News, NBC News, Reuters, The Guardian, The New York Times",

Former Minister of Transport Hadi al-Amiris coalition is in second place and current Prime Minister Haider al-Abadis coalition is in third place. More than 91 percent of Saturdays vote has been counted and the remaining votes are not expected to affect al-Sadrs lead, Reuters reported. \nVoter turnout was 44 percent, the lowest since 2003 after Saddam Hussein was removed from power as part of a U.S.-led invasion. Saturdays election was the first since Iraq announced it had retaken territories from the Islamic State (IS) and declared victory against the group in December of last year. (IS has since claimed responsibility for individual attacks.) It was the fourth election since Husseins removal. \nTop three coalitions\n1. Al-Sadr leads the al-Sairoon Coalition (The Marchers), a combination of the Sadrist Movement and the Iraqi Communist Party. Al-Sadr does not support the influence of Iran or the United States in Iraqi politics, according to the Associated Press. \n2. Al-Amiri, a Shiite militia chief, leads the Fatah Coalition, which is in second place in the preliminary vote results. The Fatah Coalition is a combination of the Islamic Supreme Coalition of Iraq (ISCI) and the Popular Mobilization Units (PMUs) Shiite militia groups. Iran supports al-Amiri, according to Reuters.\n3. Prime Minister al-Abadi leads the Nasr Coalition (Victory of Iraq). Al-Abadi is an ally of both Iran and the U.S., according to Reuters.\nAl-Sadr is the son of the late Ayatollah Mohammad Sadq al-Sadr; ayatollahs are Shiite religious leaders. The younger Al-Sadr campaigned on a platform of anti-corruption, AP reported. He was a commander in the fight against IS, and prior to 2011, led a militia that fought U.S. forces. \nIraqs parliament has 329 seats and a party needs to win 165 seats to have a majority. Seats are allocated based on the final vote count. If no single party wins enough seats, a majority coalition may be formed. \nSources: AP, Al Jazeera, History.com, Reuters",

The parliament passed the motion 241 to 83 on Tuesday, and instructed a committee to review the constitution and report back by August 30. \nThe Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) party brought the motion to parliament, and the ruling African National Congress (ANC) supported an amended version of the measure. EFF leader Julius Malema said, we must ensure that we restore the dignity of our people without compensating the criminals who stole our land. Two weeks ago, after Ramaphosa was sworn in as the new president, he said he would prioritize land reform.\nThe official opposition party, the Democratic Alliance, opposed the motion, arguing that it would damage property rights and could deter international investment. An unrelated group that represents mostly white South Africans, called AfriForum, said it planned to begin an international campaign against the measure, arguing its position to international governments.\nA law from 1913 had granted the majority of fertile farming land to whites and, according to the Associated Press, the possibility of land reform has been discussed since the end of apartheid and the election of the ANC led government in 1994. \nSources: AP, Reuters",

Reuters said the decision came after Islamic leaders said learning English early opened the way to a Western cultural invasion. The ban does not include secondary schools or private institutions that teach English outside the state-run education system.\nBBC noted English language lessons are taught at the secondary school level in Iran, which begins at age 12, and that their popularity has led to English lessons being offered to younger students as well.\nIn a 2016 speech given to teachers, Irans Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei criticized the teaching of English spreading to nursery schools, and said such developments were part of a Western idea of instilling \"thought and culture to the younger generation of countries. In the same speech, Khamenei reportedly said, That does not mean opposition to learning a foreign language, but (this is the) promotion of a foreign culture in the country and among children, young adults and youths.\nSources: BBC, Reuters",

      "Content": "On Monday, the Supreme Court ruled in two cases related to partisan gerrymandering, one from Wisconsin and one from Maryland. Partisan gerrymandering refers to the division of voting districts in such a way that it favors a particular party, disproportionately for the partys overall support in a state. The court found that Democrat plaintiffs in the Wisconsin case had not proved they had standing to sue. In the Maryland case, the court determined that the Republican plaintiffs had waited too long to bring their suit forward. Both decisions were unanimous. The court did not rule on the constitutionality of partisan gerrymandering.\nCongressional voting districts are based on population, which determines the number of seats each state holds in the U.S. House of Representatives. After a census, voting districts can be redrawn to account for changes in population to maintain a consistent number of voters in each district. (After the 2010 census, congressional districts have an average of about 711,000 people in them.) In the majority of states, the state legislature passes redistricting legislation, meaning the majority party in a state determines the district boundaries. \nPartisan gerrymandering can involve cracking and packing, two processes that result in so-called wasted votes. Cracking means dividing a partys supporters among multiple districts so that they fall short of a majority in each one, according to a complaint filed in the Wisconsin case. Packing means concentrating one partys backers in a few districts that they win by overwhelming margins. \nSuch a practice can result in the number of seats each party receives in a state being disproportionate to the popular vote each party received. \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has previously ruled that redistricting that disadvantages minority voters is unconstitutional. It has not ruled on the legality of gerrymandering on partisan lines. \nWisconsin case\nIn the Wisconsin case, Gill v. Whitford, the plaintiffs alleged the states redistricting plan known as Act 43 harmed the Democratic Partys ability to convert Democratic votes into Democratic seats in the legislature. Act 43 was passed after the 2010 census. \nIn the 2012 elections, Republicans received 48.6 percent of the statewide vote for Assembly candidates and won 60 of the Assemblys 99 seats (about 61 percent of the seats). In 2014, Republicans received 52 percent of the vote and won 63 seats (about 64 percent of the seats).\nThe plaintiffs said Act 43 packed some districts, putting many Democratic voters in a single district, which allegedly wastes all Democratic votes beyond the 50 percent needed for election. Other districts, the plaintiffs alleged, were cracked under Act 43, with Democratic voters spread across districts with small Republican majorities, and thereby wasting all Democratic votes in a district where the Republican candidate wins.\nIn 2016, a three-judge Federal District Court concluded that Act 43 was an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander. On Monday, the Supreme Court vacated the judgment and remanded the case for further proceedings.\nChief Justice John Roberts wrote in his opinion, On this record, it appears that not a single plaintiff sought to prove that he or she lives in a cracked or packed district.\" \nThe plaintiffs instead rested their case at trial  and their arguments before this Court  on their theory of statewide injury to Wisconsin Democrats, Roberts wrote. The Court has not found that this presents an individual and personal injury of the kind required to prove they have standing. \nJustice Elena Kagan wrote a concurring opinion, saying, Given the charges of statewide packing and cracking, affecting a slew of districts and residents, the challengers could make use of statewide evidence and seek a statewide remedy in the future.\nPaul Smith, the lead lawyer for the plaintiffs said after the ruling, the basic bottom line is there will be plaintiffs with clear standing and when we get back to the district court we should be in a position to win very substantial relief.\nMaryland case\nIn Benisek v. Lamone, the Maryland case, the Republican plaintiffs alleged Marylands 2011 congressional map for the 6th District constituted gerrymandering. Republican Roscoe Bartlett had held the U.S. congressional seat for 20 years and had been elected again in 2010, winning by 28 percentage points. After the 2011 map changed the districting, he lost the 2012 election to Democrat John Delaney by a 21-point margin. \nIn May 2017, the plaintiffs asked the District Court to enter a preliminary injunction to prevent Maryland from holding congressional elections using the 2011 map. The court denied the motion and stayed the proceedings, pending the outcome of the Gill v. Whitford case. The plaintiffs appealed the District Courts denial and the Supreme Court ruled on whether the lower courts decision was an abuse of discretion.\nIn an unsigned opinion, the Supreme Court said, a party requesting a preliminary injunction must generally show reasonable diligence, and in this case, appellants did not move for a preliminary injunction in the District Court until six years, and three general elections, after the 2011 map was adopted, and over three years after the plaintiffs first complaint was filed. The Supreme Court ruled the District Courts decision denying a preliminary injunction cannot be regarded as an abuse of discretion and affirmed the lower courts decision. \nThe case will continue in lower courts.\nSources: Benisek v.

Strzok was at the bureau for 21 years, including working on investigations into former Secretary of State Hillary Clintons use of a private email server, donations to the Clinton Foundation, and Special Counsel Robert Muellers investigation into alleged Russian interference and whether any members of Trumps campaign coordinated with Russia. Strzok was removed from the Russia investigation last year when Mueller was informed of the text messages.\nStrzok had sent a series of text messages in 2016 that were critical of Trump to then-FBI lawyer Lisa Page, with whom he had a relationship at the time and who has since left the FBI. One message from Page to Strzok in August 2016 said then-candidate Trump was not ever going to become president, right? Right?! Strzok replied, No. No he wont. Well stop it. Strzok said his message was intended to reassure Page that Trump would not be elected, not to suggest that he would do something to impact the investigation, according to a report the Department of Justices Office of the Inspector General (OIG) released in June of this year.\nStrzok, who was a deputy assistant director for counterintelligence, addressed the issue at a public joint hearing of two House committees last month. Let me be clear, unequivocally and under oath: Not once in my 26 years of defending our nation did my personal opinions impact any official action I took, Strzok said. This is true for the Clinton email investigation, for the investigation into Russian interference and for every other investigation Ive worked on. He has apologized for sending the messages. \nA lengthy investigation and multiple rounds of Congressional testimony failed to produce a shred of evidence that Special Agent Strzoks personal views ever affected his work, said Goelman, Strzoks lawyer.\nGoelman said in a statement that the firing departed from established precedent, alleging it was politically motivated and adding that the decision should be deeply troubling to all Americans. He said Deputy Director David Bowdich overruled the FBI's Office of Professional Responsibility, which, after investigation, had advised Strzok should be demoted and suspended for 60 days. \nThe FBI has not publicly commented on the dismissal. \nTrumps response\nTrump said in a tweet that Strzok was finally fired, and questioned whether the Mueller investigation would be dismissed. Agent Peter Strzok was just fired from the FBI - finally. The list of bad players in the FBI  longer. Based on the fact that Strzok was in charge of the Witch Hunt, will it be dropped? It is a total Hoax. No Collusion, No Obstruction - I just fight back! Trumps full tweet said. \nSources: DHS, DOJ, Fox News, Fox News, GoFundMe, OIG, Reuters, The Washington Post, The Washington Post, The Washington Post, USA Today",

The incidents began almost two years earlier, and resulted in nausea, headaches, fatigue, dizziness, sleep problems and hearing loss for some diplomats. Here is a timeline of what happened:\nNovember 2016: Diplomatic staff in Cuba start to experience neurological symptoms associated with exposure to auditory and sensory phenomena, according to a report issued by the University of Pennsylvanias Center for Brain Injury and Repair.\nFebruary - April 2017: Doctors at the University of Miami evaluate 80 embassy community members and identify 16 individuals with neurological signs and symptoms similar to those following mild traumatic brain injuries such as a concussion.\nMay 23, 2017: In response to the alleged attacks, the U.S. State Department asks two officials with the Cuban embassy in the U.S. to leave the country.\nJuly 2017: The State Departments Bureau of Medical Services concludes that the symptoms were most likely related to neurotrauma from a nonnatural source and recommends continuing the investigation.\nSept. 29, 2017: The State Department announces diplomatic staff reductions in Havana in response to the alleged attacks, citing the need to protect the health, safety, and well-being of embassy staff.\n\nOct. 3, 2017: Then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson announces the expulsion of 15 Cuban diplomats from the U.S. embassy in Cuba, citing the countrys failure to protect U.S. diplomats.\nMarch 20, 2018: Douglas Smith and his associates publish a report on the alleged attack on U.S. diplomats in Cuba. The report does not determine a cause for the diplomats neurological symptoms.\nMay 16, 2018: A U.S. government employee serving in China is medically-confirmed to have similar neurological symptoms as the U.S. diplomats who were stationed in Cuba.\nMay 23, 2018: The State Department establishes a multi-agency task force to investigate the alleged attacks in both Cuba and China.\nJune 5, 2018: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announces that 24 U.S. government personnel and family members who served in Cuba have been medically-confirmed as having symptoms similar to those noted following concussion or minor traumatic brain injury.\nSept. 1, 2018: In an interview with The New York Times, Smith discusses the possibility that a microwave weapon is responsible for the alleged attacks on U.S. diplomatic staff and family members.\n",

      "Content": "At about 1:30 a.m. local time on Tuesday, a white female graduate student at Yale University called the police to report a black female sleeping in the common room of her dormitory. Sarah Braasch, 43, a graduate student in philosophy, called the police on Lolade Siyonbola, 34, a graduate student in African studies. Siyonbola said she was working on a paper and fell asleep. She said Braasch came in and said, Youre not supposed to be sleeping here. Im going to call the police.\nSiyonbola posted two videos to Facebook: the first was 54 seconds long and showed an interaction with Braasch; the second video was about 17 minutes long and showed Siyonbolas interaction with campus police. In the first video, Braasch tells Siyonbola, I have every right to call the police. You cannot sleep in that room. Siyonbola posted the second video at 1:56 a.m. local time on Tuesday, and it had 1.1 million views as of 7:30 p.m. local time on Thursday. \nThe second video shows police asking Siyonbola for her student ID, which she did not provide at first. She used a key to show police she could open her dorm room, and the officers asked her again for her ID. One of the officers said, You're in a Yale building and we need to make sure that you belong here. Siyonbola handed her ID to one of the officers, who then called dispatch to check the ID. It took about 14 minutes to verify that Siyonbola was a student at Yale since the name on her ID did not exactly match her name in university records. Yale said it allows students to put their preferred names on ID cards. After verifying that Siyonbola was a student, police let her go.\nIn her video, Siyonbola referred to a friend of hers on whom Braasch had previously called the police. Reneson Jean-Louis, a black graduate student, said Braasch called the police on him about a month ago. He said Braasch said during the incident, Youre making me uncomfortable. I don't feel safe around you. You're an intruder. You need to leave, you need to get out.\nYale Police Chief Ronnell Higgins said police told Braasch that Siyonbola was an authorized resident who had every right to be there after they spoke with her. He said police also told Braasch that this was not a police matter and they would report the incident to the dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.\nYales response\nOn Wednesday, Yale spokesman Tom Conroy said the university believes campus police followed procedures. He said the university would, as it does with every incident, review the police response to ensure the proper protocol was followed, and to determine if there was anything we could have done better. \nYale said campus police \"are trained on unconscious bias, de-escalation techniques, and problem solving, and seek to treat each individual with respect.\nOn Tuesday, Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Dean Lynn Cooley said the university had continued work to do to make Yale a truly inclusive place. She said she was committed with the university to redoubling our efforts to build a supportive community in which all graduate students are empowered in their intellectual pursuits and professional goals within a welcoming environment. She said an essential part of those efforts was a commitment to mutual respect and an open dialog.\nYales Vice President for Student Life Kimberly Goff-Crews said she was deeply troubled by the incident, and that she and Dr. Cooley would hold listening sessions in which students could voice their views and concerns regarding the incident in the coming days. Goff-Crews said, This incident and others recently reported to me underscore that we have work to do to make Yale not only excellent but also inclusive.\nSiyonbolas response\nRegarding Goff-Crews statement, Siyonbola reportedly said, It wasnt compassionate. It was very high-level  like we have to do better someday, somehow.\nOn Tuesday, Siyonbola posted a message on Facebook, saying, \"Grateful for all the love, kind words and prayers, your support has been overwhelming. Black Yale community is beyond incredible and is taking good care of me. I know this incident is a drop in the bucket of trauma Black folk have endured since Day 1 America, and you all have stories. Share below if you feel led.\"\nSiyonbola founded the Yoruba Cultural Institute in Brooklyn, New York. She has written a book on African history and diaspora migration.\nSources: ABC News, CNN, Heavy.com, HuffPost, The New York Times",

Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said at least 90 died in the landslides, and 13 died later of cardiac arrest. Rains began late last week as the remnants of a typhoon combined with a seasonal front. \n\nThe Japanese government set up an emergency management center at the prime ministers office, and 54,000 people were involved in rescue operations. Evacuation orders or advisories were issued for up to 5.9 million people over 19 prefectures at one point, according to Kyodo News. By Monday, emergency rain warnings were lifted, as the rescue operations continued.\nRescue missions were carried out using boats and 40 helicopters, The Associated Press reported on Sunday. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said, \"Rescue efforts are a battle with time. The rescue teams are doing their utmost.\"\nMore than 30,000 people were staying in evacuation centers as of 3 p.m. local time on Sunday, according to the Fire and Disaster Management Agency.\nThe Japan Meteorological Agency said 10.4 inches (26.3 cm) of rain fell over a three-hour period in one area in Kochi prefecture.

He also agreed to permanently dismantle North Koreas Yongbyon nuclear facility contingent upon corresponding measures by the United States, South Korean President Moon Jae-in said in a statement. \nMoon made the announcement after the two leaders met in North Koreas capital, Pyongyang, to discuss implementation of the Panmunjom declaration that both countries agreed to in April of this year. The declaration included a commitment to denuclearize the Korean peninsula and strengthen inter-Korean diplomacy. \nWhile the leaders didnt specify the measures they want the U.S. to take in order for North Korea to dismantle the nuclear facility, Moon said the Koreas would closely consult and cooperate with the United States and the international community as they denuclearize the peninsula.\nWhen asked about the corresponding measures, President Donald Trump said, Well see what hes looking at. Well see. But in the meantime, were talking. Its very calm. Hes calm; Im calm. So well see what happens.\nKim promised to allow international inspectors to monitor the closing of the Dongchang-ri missile test site and launch pad, The Associated Press reported. Wednesdays announcement did not include a timetable for the dismantlement of the countrys missile facilities, and didnt say how many facilities and launch sites North Korea has or plans to dismantle.\nMoon said the two leaders also agreed to establish an inter-Korean military committee to enable constant consultations on implementing military-related agreements. \nMoon also noted that the two countries would work to reconnect railroads and roads on their eastern and western coastal regions within the year, increase tourism at North Koreas Geumgang Mountain, and restore the Geumgang reunion center to facilitate video conference reunions among inter-Korean families.\nThe Koreas also plan to bid to jointly host the 2032 Summer Olympics.\n\nSources: AP, North Korea statement, South Korea statement, White House statement",

      "Content": "Volcanic lava on Hawaiis Big Island reached the Pacific Ocean over the weekend, creating a hazardous white plume containing hydrochloric acid and fine particles of glass. The lava flow entered the ocean on the islands southern coast on Saturday night, according to the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory (HVO), after the Kilauea volcano began erupting two and a half weeks ago. The flow crossed Highway 137 and created a 20-foot wall across the highway around 10:30 p.m. local time on Saturday, CBS News reported. \nThe plume of particles and acidic gas known as laze, a combination of lava and haze, can cause eye and skin irritation, difficulty breathing and, the HVO said, in past cases has caused death. The laze had traveled 15 miles (24 km) west of the entry point as on Monday morning. A U.S. Geological Survey scientist said it was running parallel to the coast. \nThe U.S. Coast Guard implemented a Lava Entry Safety Zone 984 feet (300 meters) around the lava ocean entry point, indicating where navigable waters began. Getting too close to the lava can result in serious injury or death, U.S. Coast Guard representative Lt. Cmdr. John Bannon said. \nSince Kilauea began erupting on May 3, it has burned approximately 40 buildings, including homes, and about 2,000 people have been evacuated. Roughly 300 people are staying in shelters, CBS News reported. \nThere have been about 2,250 earthquakes on or around the Big Island since May 3, including a 5.0 and a 4.9 magnitude tremor each at the summit of the volcano, according to meteorologist Haley Brink. Kilauea Volcano erupted at least twice over the weekend, including one incident that created a 10,000 foot (3 km) tall ash cloud. Hawaii County has issued warnings about the air quality. \nAt least 23 fissures have opened up since May 3, and the rate of sulfur dioxide gas escaping from the fissures has tripled, according to the HVO. \n \nLast week, President Donald Trump declared a major disaster on the Big Island. Hawaiian Gov. David Ige said the state was monitoring the situation, and as with typical eruptions and lava flows, would allow the eruption to run its course.\nHawaiian tourism officials said the majority of the Big Island is unaffected and available for access. \nSources: CBS/AP, CNN, Hawaii News Now, White House",

      "Content": "A Texas jury sentenced former police officer Roy Oliver on Wednesday to 15 years in prison and fined him $10,000 for fatally shooting 15-year-old Jordan Edwards last year. Edwards was unarmed during the altercation.\nThe jury had found Oliver, who is white, guilty of murder for shooting Edwards, who is black, on Tuesday. Oliver's legal team said they would appeal the verdict.\nCharmaine Edwards, Jordans stepmother, told the Associated Press she felt the sentence was too lenient. He can actually see life again after 15 years and thats not enough because Jordan cant see life again. Olivers legal team said he could be eligible for parole after 7  years, AP reported. The prosecution had requested a sentence of 60 years.\n\nThe Dallas-based advocacy group Mothers Against Police Brutality issued a statement saying the sentence Oliver received was not commensurate with his crime, noting that half of Texas inmates imprisoned for murder are serving sentences greater than 40 years, according to National Crime Information Center data submitted by the Texas Department of Criminal Justice.\nThe American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Texas said of the verdict: There is a long history in this country of failing to hold law enforcement responsible for even the gravest abuses of power. The prosecution of Roy Oliver and todays guilty verdict send a powerful message: Roy Olivers actions were murder, and he will be held accountable.\nPolice officers are not frequently convicted for on-duty shootings, AP reported. Since 2005, six non-federal police officers have been convicted of murder in such cases, according to data compiled by criminologist and Bowling Green State University professor Phil Stinson. Four of those convictions were overturned.\nBackground\nOn April 29, 2017, police responded to a call about underage drinking at a house in the suburb of Balch Springs, Texas. When officers entered the home, they reportedly heard what they described as gunshots coming from outside the house. The people inside the house then began to flee. \nOutside the house, Olivers partner Tyler Gross attempted to stop a car containing teenagers from leaving the scene. Gross allegedly broke a passenger window on the car during the altercation. Oliver then fired several shots into the car, shooting Edwards in the back of the head. Edwards was in the front passenger seat of the car at the time of the shooting. \nOliver initially claimed that he shot at the car because he thought it was going to back up into Gross. Body camera footage showed the car driving away from his partner, not at him, and Gross later testified that he did not feel that his life was in danger and had not felt the need to use his gun.\nOliver was fired by the Balch Springs Police Department shortly after the shooting.\n\nSources: ACLU TX, AP, BBC, Mothers Against Police Brutality, Oliver trial verdict, Oliver sentencing",

The company stated that posts to the three pages had \"repeatedly broken\" its \"Community Standards.\" Britain Firsts website says the organization rejects racial hatred in all its forms.\nFacebook said it gave the pages administrators a \"written final warning,\" and that the administrators \"continued to post content that violates our Community Standards.\" Some of the posts on the three pages included a photograph of Golding and Fransen with a caption of \"Islamophobic and Proud,\" and another caption that compared Muslim immigrants to animals, BBC reported.\nRegarding its decision, Facebook said, \"We are an open platform for all ideas and political speech goes to the heart of free expression.\" It added that \"political views can and should be expressed without hate. People can express robust and controversial opinions without needing to denigrate others on the basis of who they are.\"\nBefore its removal from Facebook, more than two million people had liked the Britain First page.

      "Content": "On Monday, the Registrar General of India published the final draft of the National Register of Citizens (NRC) citizenship list for the state of Assam, which borders Bangladesh in northeast India. The draft excludes approximately four million people who applied for the list and claim to be in the state legally, whom the Assam government claims are illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. Officials said there would not be immediate deportations of people not on the list, and that excluded people may enter an appeal process, BBC reported. \nThe NRC list includes people who can prove they or their ancestors entered Assam state by March 24, 1971, the day before Bangladesh declared independence from Pakistan and an armed conflict followed. During that time, about 10 million Bengalis relocated to India, according to Encyclopedia Britannica. \nBengalis are an ethnic group, who speak a language of the same name. Assam government claims that illegal Bangladeshi immigrants have been living among the legal Bengali population in the state, sometimes using forged papers. \nThe updated NRC was compiled as part of the implementation of the 1985 Assam Accord, an agreement between the Indian government, the Assam government and Assam groups to remove illegal immigrants from the state. The accord, signed by then-Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, said those who did not arrive in Assam before March 25, 1971, would not be considered legitimate citizens, and would be deleted from electoral rolls and expelled from the country. \nCriteria for inclusion on the updated citizen list, compiled in accordance the Assam Accord, was that the individual, or his or her ancestors, was on a voter list prior to that date, or was on the NRC when it was last updated in 1951, according to The Hindustan Times. \nApproximately 33 million people (the population of Assam) applied for inclusion on the list, and 29 million have been found eligible, according to the Registrar General of India, Sailesh, who goes by a single name. \nExclusions from the list\nThe four million excluded from the list will be able to appeal the decision from Aug. 30 to Sept. 28, according to Sailesh. An initial draft version of the list was released in December, under the supervision of Indias Supreme Court, according to the government. The final list will not be published until all appeals have been processed, according to officials cited by NPR. \nThose not included on the citizenship list could be taken to detention centers, be deported or obtain long-term work permits without land ownership and political rights, according to The Hindustan Times.\nEveryone will be given a right to prove their citizenship, Assams law minister, Siddhartha Bhattacharya, told the BBC. But if they fail to do so, well, the legal system will take its own course. When the reported asked if he meant the people would be expelled, the minister said, yes. \nBangladesh, which received hundred of thousands of Rohingya refugees from Myanmar last year, has not publicly said it would accept new refugees from Assam, BBC reported.\nAllegations of bias\nSome activists have alleged that the NCR is intentionally designed to remove Bengalis, a majority of whom are Muslim, from the Hindu-majority state. Bengali campaigner Nazrul Ali Ahmed alleged, They are openly threatening to get rid of Muslims, and what happened to the Rohingya in Myanmar could happen to us here.\nIndian Home Minister Rajnath Singh said the list was completely impartial adding, some people are unnecessarily trying to create an atmosphere of fear.\nPrateek Hajela, who is in charge of the NCR, said in a statement the list makes no differentiation on the basis of religion or language in determining citizenship, in accordance with the law.\nSources: Assam Government, Encyclopedia Britannica, BBC, Bloomberg, The Hindustan Times, NPR",

Trump made the comments after The Guardian published excerpts from the book Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House, by journalist Michael Wolff. In the book, Bannon is quoted as saying he thought a meeting during the campaign between Trumps son-in-law Jared Kushner, Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and a Russian lawyer, which lawyers did not attend, was treasonous and unpatriotic. \nWhite House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders, who read Trumps statement in a press briefing Wednesday, said Bannons statements about the president, his administration and family were outrageous and completely false. Bannon has not issued a response to Trumps or Sanders' statements.\nAccording to The Washington Post, Wolff said Trump knew about the book and the authors discussions with others about it. Sanders confirmed that Wolff had made about a dozen visits to the White House that had nothing to do originally with the book, and that close to 95 percent of the visits were requested by Bannon. \nIn the statement, Trump said Bannon spent his time at the White House leaking false information to the media, that he had little to do with our historic victory, and that he doesnt represent my basehes only in it for himself. Responding to a question on what this feud would do to the Presidents base, Sanders said, The Presidents base is very solid. It hasnt changed because the President hasnt and his agenda hasnt changed.\nOn Jan. 4, TIME wrote that Trumps lawyers reportedly served Bannon with a cease-and-desist letter the previous day threatening legal damages and demanding that Bannon avoid making defamatory comments about the president and first family as details from an upcoming book begin to be released.\nBannon became chief executive of Trumps presidential campaign in August 2016 and was appointed chief strategist after Trump won the election. In August 2017, after Bannon resigned and returned to Breitbart News as executive chairman, Trump thanked him for his service during the presidential campaign.\nWhen Bannon left the White House, he said, If theres any confusion out there, let me clear it up: Im leaving the White House and going to war for Trump against his opponents -- on Capitol Hill, in the media and in corporate America.\nSources: CNN, Fox News, The New York Times, The Washington Post",

      "Content": "Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Calif.) and his wife Margaret Hunter were indicted by a federal grand jury on Tuesday for allegedly misusing more than $250,000 in campaign funds for personal use, such as for family vacations and tuition, and filing false records with the Federal Election Commission (FEC). \nA 47-page indictment lists 60 counts against the Hunters for conspiracy to commit offenses against the United States, wire fraud, falsification of records and prohibited use of campaign contributions. The indictment cites instances from 2009 to 2016. \nThe U.S. Attorneys Office for the Southern District of California said the Hunters used campaign funds to pay for expenses such as family vacations to Hawaii and Italy, travel expenses for relatives, tuition for their childrens private school, dental work, theater tickets, groceries and more. These expenses were mischaracterized under vague or misleading descriptors in FEC filings, the office said. For example, dental work was filed as a charitable contribution to Smiles for Life, according to the office. \nThe Hunters spent substantially more than they earned, the indictment alleged. They overdrew their bank account more than 1,100 times in a seven-year period resulting in approximately $37,761 in overdraft and insufficient funds bank fees.\nTodays indictment is a reminder that no one is above the law, said U.S. Attorney Adam Braverman, who signed the indictment.\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan said the allegations against Hunter were deeply serious, and that the representative would be removed from committee work while under indictment. \nHunter, a five-term Republican congressman, is currently up for reelection in the November midterms. Prior to the indictment, Republicans held a 14 point lead in his southern California district, Fox News reported. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi said on Tuesday that Ryan should call on Hunter to resign. The San Diego Union-Tribune, the local newspaper in Hunters hometown, also called on Hunter to resign in an editorial.\nThe investigation against Hunter began in June 2016, and the FBIs San Diego Division raided the Hunters home in 2017. \nEarlier this month, Hunter's attorney, Gregory A. Vega, sent a letter to U.S. Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein asking him to postpone the indictment, which followed a more than two-year investigation. The letter said that the Hunters had reimbursed about $60,000 to the campaign in 2017. \nVegas letter alleged that the charges were politically motivated because Hunter had supported Trumps candidacy and two prosecutors in the California district supported candidate Hillary Clinton. \nDuncan Hunter, 41, and Margaret Hunter, 43, are scheduled to be arraigned on Thursday morning. \n\nSources: CBS News, DOJ California, Fox News, Hunter Indictment",

      "Content": "On Friday, the International Criminal Court (ICC) overturned the 2016 conviction of Jean-Pierre Bemba, the former vice president of the Democratic Republic of Congo, for war crimes and crimes against humanity. In a 3-2 decision on the five-judge panel, the court ruled that Bemba could not be held responsible for crimes, including rapes and murders, carried out by a militia under his command while they were in the neighboring Central African Republic (CAR). \nBemba cannot be held criminally responsible for the crimes committed by [Movement for the Liberation of Congo] troops during the Central African Republic operation, the presiding judge Christine Van den Wyngaert read from the ruling. \nVan den Wyngaert also said the initial trial judges had ignored significant testimonial evidence that Bemba's ability to investigate and punish crimes in CAR was limited, and failed to account for his attempts to stop the crimes once he learned of them.\nThe case\nBemba commanded the Movement for the Liberation of Congo (MLC) militia, which he helped form as a rebel group in 1998. In 2002, at the request of then-CAR President Ange Felix Patasse, Bemba sent about 1,000 MLC troops to the neighboring country to stop an attempted coup. While in CAR, MLC troops engaged in an alleged campaign of rape, sexual violence and murder of civilians between 2002 and 2003. \nAlthough Bemba had not ordered this campaign, prosecutors argued he was aware of it and did not stop it. \nBemba was arrested by the ICC in 2008 and his trial began in 2010. After a trial of over five years with more than 5,000 witnesses, the ICC panel of judges unanimously found him guilty of two counts of crimes against humanity and three counts of war crimes. He was sentenced to 18 years in prison. His sentence was later increased by a year and he was fined for attempting to interfere with witnesses testimony. \nBemba will not be immediately released from detention at The Hague, as a separate panel of judges will determine what sentence he should be given for witness interference, Van den Wyngaert said. The court is scheduled to meet Tuesday on the matter. \nResponses to the ruling\nIts not some acquittal on a technicality, Bembas attorney Peter Haynes said. They went to the very heart of a commanders culpability, namely his responsibility to ensure that when put in the knowledge of crimes he takes steps to investigate them and punish them. He added that it was immoral and it may even be illegal to not immediately release Bemba from custody. \nICC prosecutor Fatou Bensouda said Fridays decision was regrettable and troubling.\nThe two dissenting judges wrote in an opinion that Bembas acquittal was based on an incorrect standard of appellate review.\nThe head of Amnesty Internationals international justice team, Solomon Sacco, called the decision a blow for CAR victims. \n5,229 survivors of Bembas atrocities participated in the ICC proceedings  for these brave individuals, as well as thousands of other victims in CAR, the pursuit of truth, justice and reparations will continue, Sacco said.\nKarine Bonneau of the International Federation for Human Rights said the ruling seemed to tell other leaders that as long as you are not on the scene, you will not be condemned for the crimes of your troops. \nThe ICC\nThe ICC permanent war crimes court was established in 2002 at The Hague in the Netherlands, under the Rome Statute treaty of 1998 signed by 120 countries at a U.N. conference. The court is an independent judicial body designed to prosecute people for genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity and aggression. The ICC can investigate and prosecute these crimes in a country when local authorities do not.\nThe ICC has issued 32 arrest warrants in 26 cases, some of which were dropped after suspects died. Judges have issued verdicts in nine cases; prior to Fridays decision, nine people have been convicted and one acquitted. \nTwo African countries, Burundi and The Gambia, have withdrawn from the ICC, alleging the court is biased against African nations and has not prosecuted people in other parts of the world. South Africa had formally written to the U.N. to indicate its intention to withdraw, then later revoked its decision. The Philippines has also said it would withdraw from the ICC, alleging the court did not follow due process after it opened an investigation into thousands of Filipino deaths since Rodrigo Duterte became president two years ago. \nSources: Al Jazeera, Al Jazeera, AP, BBC, ICC, UN",

It was the first reported use of barrel bombs, which are unguided and also known as improvised explosive devices, in the area in more than a year. The observatory reported it did not have information about casualties from bombs. \n\nThe area is controlled by opposition forces and is part of a de-escalation zone, agreed to last July by Russia, the U.S. and Israel.

Schneiderman issued a statement saying, In the last several hours, serious allegations, which I strongly contest, have been made against me. While these allegations are unrelated to my professional conduct or the operations of the office, they will effectively prevent me from leading the offices work at this critical time. I therefore resign my office.\nNew York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has called for an investigation into the allegations. No one is above the law, including New Yorks top legal officer. I will be asking an appropriate New York District Attorney(s) to commence an immediate investigation, and proceed as the facts merits (sic), Cuomo said in a statement. On Tuesday, New York Solicitor General Barbara Underwood was named the state's acting attorney general.\nAccording to The New Yorker, the four women accused Schneiderman of subjecting them to non-consensual physical violence. Two of the women  Michelle Manning Barish and Tanya Selvaratnam  went on-record, alleging Schneiderman slapped and choked them, sometimes after drinking. Manning Barish and Selvaratnam had not filed police reports but had sought medical attention for their alleged injuries. \nBoth women also said Schneiderman threatened to kill them if they left him. According to the New Yorker, a spokesperson for Schneiderman denied he made such threats. The two other women who requested not to be identified also made claims of non-consensual physical abuse.\nManning Barish dated Schneiderman from the summer of 2013 until the end of 2015. Selvaratnam dated him from the summer of 2016 until the fall of 2017.\nSchneiderman, 63, won a state Senate seat representing a Manhattan district in 1998, and became attorney general in 2010. He was running for re-election this year. \nSources: AP, CNN, The New Yorker",

      "Content": "Federal judges ruled on Monday that North Carolinas congressional districts were unconstitutional, saying they had a partisan bias. A 2016 plan to redraw congressional districts in the state was ruled as partisan gerrymander that diluted the voting strength of Democratic voters, according to a three-judge panel for the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina.\nThe case was brought against Robert Rucho, the chairman of the North Carolina\nSenate Redistricting Committee, by the League of Women Voters of\nNorth Carolina and the non-partisan advocacy group Common Cause.\nThe 2016 plan redrew the boundaries of 13 congressional districts within North Carolina. According to court documents, the states Republican-controlled General Assembly directed those responsible for drawing the 2016 plan to rely on political data to draw districts that would ensure Republican candidates would prevail in the vast majority of the states congressional districts, and would continue to do so in future elections.\nThe district court concluded that the 2016 plan violated the U.S. Constitutions Equal Protection Clause, the First Amendment, and Article I of the Constitution. The court said several congressional districts in the state had been drawn using the cracking method of redistricting. Cracking is when an opposing partys supporters are spread across multiple districts to dilute their voting power and to make it more difficult to win the most votes in a single district.\nThe district court had originally ruled against the redistricting plan on Jan. 9, 2018. OnJuly 25, the U.S. Supreme Court vacated the district courts earlier judgment and ordered the court to reexamine its verdict. In Gill v. Whitford, the Supreme Court had outlined the evidence a plaintiff must present to prove that redistricting may dilute an opposition partys vote, so it directed the district court to reconsider its case using the benchmarks outlined in the Gill v. Whitford ruling.\nIt is unknown whether the November election would be affected by the courts ruling. U.S. Circuit Judge Jim Wynn, who wrote the majority opinion, said, In such circumstances, we decline to rule out the possibility that the state should be enjoined from conducting any further congressional elections using the 2016 plan. \nIt may be viable for the State to conduct a primary election on Nov. 6, 2018, using a constitutionally compliant congressional districting plan, and then conduct a general election sometime before the new Congress is seated in January 2019. The judge left that decision to the litigants in the case. Wynn said the litigants had until Aug. 31 to file briefs on how they would like to proceed. \nWhat is gerrymandering?\nGerrymandering is the act of dividing an area into election districts to give special advantages to one group, as defined by Merriam Webster. This can be done through processes known as packing or cracking when a states congressional districts are redrawn.\n \nPacking is when a district is drawn so that the electorate includes as many members of the opposing party as possible to limit the number of representatives won by that party in other districts. For example, a district could be packed with people registered with one party so they win that district by far more than the required 50 percent. This would remove those supporters from other districts in the state so those districts are not as competitive, and can be more easily won by the other party. \n\nCracking is when the opposing partys supporters are spread across multiple districts to dilute their voting power and to make it more difficult to win the most votes in a single district. \nWhat is a congressional district?\nCongressional districts are the 435 areas across the U.S. from which members are elected to the House of Representatives. The number, size and shape of congressional districts in each state varies and can change based on population, as determined by U.S. census data gathered every 10 years. Because of this, states need to adjust their districts to ensure that constituents are adequately represented. Each state is responsible for creating and maintaining its congressional districts.\nEach congressional district is to be as equal in population to all other congressional districts in a state as practicable, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. The boundaries and numbers shown for the congressional districts are those specified in the state laws or court orders establishing the districts within each state.\nUPDATE: On Sept. 4, 2018, a federal court ruled that there was insufficient time for the court to approve a new districting plan before for the November election and that the state would have to use the current map.\n\nSources: Court ruling, U.S. Census Bureau",

      "Content": "President Donald Trump confirmed on Wednesday that CIA Director Mike Pompeo met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in preparation for a planned meeting between Trump and Kim. Trumps confirmation followed news reports about the meeting on Tuesday. The president nominated Pompeo to replace Rex Tillerson as secretary of state, after Tillersons resignation was announced last month. Pompeo is currently participating in confirmation hearings with a senate committee.\nMike Pompeo met with Kim Jong Un in North Korea last week, Trump tweeted Wednesday. On Tuesday, The Washington Post first reported the meeting took place, saying it occurred over Easter weekend, March 31 to April 1. White House officials confirmed on Wednesday that Pompeo met with Kim over the Easter weekend, AP reported.\nIn Trumps tweet about Pompeo in North Korea, he said, Meeting went very smoothly and a good relationship was formed. Details of Summit are being worked out now. Denuclearization will be a great thing for World, but also for North Korea! Trump tweeted while in Florida meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.\nThe White House said Trumps meeting with Kim Jong Un would likely happen in the second half of May or first half of June, somewhere in Europe or Asia. On Tuesday, Trump said, its possible things wont go well and we wont have the meetings. Trump would be the first sitting U.S. president to meet with a leader of North Korea since the Korean War. \nPompeos meeting with Kim was the highest level meeting between a North Korean leader and an American official since 2000, when then-Secretary of State Madeleine Albright met with Kim Jong-Il, who was Kim Jong Uns father.\nChinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said Wednesday that China hopes the U.S. and North Korea will work towards a political resolution to the situation between North and South Korea, who are technically still at war after a cease-fire marked the end of fighting in the Korean War of 1950 to 1953. North Korea is also currently under U.N. sanctions for its nuclear and ballistic missile test programs.\nKim is scheduled to meet with South Korean President Moon Jae-in in the demilitarized zone between the two countries on April 27.\nPompeos secretary of state confirmation hearings\nDuring a confirmation hearing with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee last week, Pompeo said meetings with North Korea could lead to a possible comprehensive agreement on denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. \nIm optimistic that the United States government can set the conditions for that appropriately so that the president and the North Korean leader can have that conversation and will set us down the course of achieving a diplomatic outcome that America and the world so desperately need, Pompeo said. \nThe Senate Foreign Relations Committee will be the first to vote on Pompeos nomination for secretary of state. Republicans have an 11-10 majority on the committee. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) has said he will vote against Pompeos confirmation. If the committee does not vote in Pompeos favor, his nomination could be sent to the full Senate with a recommendation from the committee against confirmation.\nRepublicans hold a 51-49 majority in the full Senate, though Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) is away from the senate for health reasons, leaving Republicans with 50 to 49 seats. If Paul votes against Pompeo, at least one Democrat would have to vote yes to confirm him in a vote of the full Senate. \nWhen Pompeo was confirmed as director of the CIA in January of last year, 14 Democrats voted in his favor. At least three of those Democrats, Sens. Dianne Feinstein (Calif.), Jeanne Shaheen (N.H.) and Tim Kaine (Va.), said they would not vote for him for the position of secretary of state. \nOn Wednesday, Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) said he expects a full Senate vote on Pompeo could happen next week.\nSources: AP, CNN, Politico, The Hill, The Washington Post",

      "Content": "On Friday, The New York Times reported on comments made by Barney Harford, Chief Operating Officer (COO) of the ride-hailing company Uber, that were allegedly insensitive to race and gender. Harford said, I have been embarrassed to learn that at times I made comments that made people feel uncomfortable, isolated, or unwelcome. Certainly that was not my intent, but I make no excuses for my behavior. To those of you who I hurt with careless words, Im sorry.\nFive anonymous people familiar with the conversation alleged that in a meeting, Harford spoke about a potential video advertisement for the company, commenting aloud how common the pairing was among the audiences that would see it, the Times reported. He also allegedly said he could not tell the difference between two black women who had the same hairstyles in one version of the ad. Harford later told coworkers he regretted the phrasing he used.\nAlso, two Uber employees said Harford, 46, made comments at a Women of Uber internal group meeting, where he was the groups sponsor. Some thought the comments were insensitive toward women. Harford also allegedly made comments at a meeting with a team that oversees Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Some felt those comments were insensitive and some became upset, according to the two Uber employees who spoke to the Times.\nSince the alleged video advertisement incident, multiple Uber employees have filed complaints about Harfords behavior with Ubers human resources department, the head of diversity and with other executives, the Times reported. Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi was informed of some complaints and addressed them directly with Harford. Khosrowshahi, a former Expedia CEO, hired Harford last December. The two had previously worked together at Expedia. \nIn a memo to staff on Friday, Harford mentioned the forthcoming painful story from the Times and said, \"You have my commitment that I will do everything necessary to create a truly inclusive environment. I will be working directly with Khosrowshahi and others to ensure that I have a plan that will enable me to become a better leader to all of our colleagues. I am committed to working with a coach who will challenge me to confront my blind spots. And, most importantly, I will seek out opportunities to build the best, highest performing, and most diverse business leadership team.\nKhosrowshahi, who was named Ubers CEO in August after the companys former CEO Travis Kalanick resigned last June, said, Cultures are not built or rebuilt overnight. People learn, companies learn, CEOs learn. Its a process of constant self-reflection and improvement, and it takes work to make real change. He added, I am committed to doing more and doing better as we build a culture where everyone feels they belong, are (sic) challenged but respected, and can grow and succeed. Well make mistakes along the way, but one thing is certain: We will improve, substantially.\nOther recent Uber news\nOn July 9, Ubers Chief Legal Officer Tony West tweeted that the company had hired what CNN reported was the companys first-ever chief compliance and ethics officer.\nOn July 10, Uber's HR head, Liane Hornsey, resigned without stating a reason, according to related emails Reuters reported from her to her employees, and from Khosrowshahi to employees. Reuters noted she had not responded to a request for comment the previous day related to an investigation into her handling of racial discrimination allegations at the company. Uber said it was confident that the investigation had been conducted in an unbiased, thorough and credible manner, and that the conclusions of the investigation were addressed appropriately. Hornsey had been HR head for about 18 months, according to Reuters.\nOn Friday, Uber said it was in the process of implementing a system to notify the company in real time when one of its drivers was charged with a crime. It said it had dismissed 25 drivers since it started using the system this month. The system was a result of Uber working with Appriss, a company that obtains local government data on arrests, and Checkr, the company that Uber uses for background checks. \nSafety is essential to Uber and we want to ensure drivers continue to meet our standards on an ongoing basis,\" said Gus Fuldner, vice president of safety and insurance at Uber. He added, \"This new continuous checking technology will strengthen our screening process and improve safety.\"\nSources: Business Insider, CNN 1, CNN 2, Gizmodo, Reuters, The New York Times",

The debris was from two Yemeni Houthi rebel missiles fired in November. Irans spokesman at the U.N. said Iran categorically rejects the evidence as unfounded and fabricated. \nHaley, speaking at Bolling Air Force Base in Washington, D.C., said nine valves and a lack of fins on one piece of debris indicated it was from an Iranian Qiam missile. She said the U.S. was disclosing this evidence for Congress and U.N. members to see. International peace and security depends on us working together against the Iranian regimes hostile actions, she said. \nHaley said the Iranian origin of the missiles was evidence that Iran violated U.N. Resolution 2231, adding that the U.S. was not currently planning to use the evidence to end the 2015 nuclear agreement with Iran. The 2015 agreement restricts Irans nuclear activities and ballistic-missile related activities in exchange for a lifting of sanctions against the country.\nThe missiles that Haley spoke about were fired at Saudi Arabia by Yemeni Houthi rebels, one allegedly aimed at Riyadh airport and the other intercepted near Mecca. The Iranian spokesman at the U.N., Alireza Miryousefi, said the accusations that Iran supplied the missiles seek also to cover up for the Saudi war crimes in Yemen, with US complicity. \nU.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres submitted a report to the U.N. Security Council concluding that the two missiles found in Saudi Arabia were of common origin. The report said they could not be conclusively stated to have originated in Iran.\nAccording to Saudi state news agency SPA, Saudi Arabia welcomes the UN report and said the international community should hold the Iranian regime accountable for hostile actions.\nSources: BBC, The Guardian",

The Russian government denies involvement. \nDeputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein announced at a news conference on Friday that eleven of the defendants were charged with conspiring to hack into computers, steal documents, and release those documents with the intent to interfere in the election. One of those dependents along with a twelfth military officer were charged with conspiring to infiltrate computers of organizations that administer the election, such as state election boards. \nThe defendants are members of Russias Main Intelligence Directorate of the General Staff (GRU), according to the indictment, which alleges they were acting within their official capacities. The GRU is a federal intelligence agency and reports directly to the Russian militarys General Staff. \nThere is no allegation in this indictment that any American citizen committed a crime, Rosenstein said. There is no allegation that the conspiracy altered the vote count or changed any election result.\nThe indictment alleges that starting in March 2016, the GRU officials hacked into the DNC, Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and members of the Clinton campaign, including then-campaign manager John Podesta. They are accused of gaining access to and monitoring the computers of dozens of Democratic officials and volunteers by for example, using phishing emails to gain access to accounts and implanting malware. (Phishing scam emails are often fraudulent emails masked to look as if they are from legitimate companies or organizations, and ask recipients to enter login or account information.)\nTens of thousands of emails that were obtained, the indictment alleges, were distributed through accounts of false personas, such as DCLeaks and Guccifer 2.0, in June 2016.\nThe Russian government has denied interfering with the election, and did so again on Friday. The Russian state has never interfered and has no intention of interfering in the U.S. elections, said Yuri Ushakov, President Vladimir Putins foreign affairs adviser.\nPresident Donald Trump is scheduled to meet with Putin at a one-on-one summit on Monday in Helsinki, Finland. The White House said Friday that there was no plan to alter the scheduled meeting. \nFridays charges results from Special Counsel Robert Muellers investigation into alleged Russian election interference and whether there was coordination with any members of the Trump campaign, and related matters. Prior to Friday, the investigation had led to 20 people and three companies being charged, including four former Trump campaign officials or White House officials on charges unrelated to the alleged election interference. \nSources: AP, CNN, C-SPAN",

      "Content": "On Wednesday, U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis met with Chinese President Xi Jinping during a three-day visit to China that began Tuesday. Mattis said he was visiting because of the importance that \"we in the U.S. military place on the military-to-military relationship with the Chinese. Xi said relations between the two countries militaries is a \"model component of our overall bilateral relations.\" Prior to meeting Xi, Mattis met with Chinese Defense Minister Wei Fenghe, with whom he said he had a \"very open and honest dialogue.\"\nI'm here to keep our relationship on a great trajectory, going in the right direction, Mattis said.\nOn Sunday, before leaving for his Asia trip, Mattis said he hoped to establish a \"transparent strategic dialogue\" with his Chinese counterparts. \"Going forward, we obviously look at the actions of China, but I am going there to do a lot of listening and identification of common ground and uncommon ground on the strategic level at this time,\" he said.\n\"I did not want to immediately go in with a certain preset expectation of what they are going to say, Mattis said before the meeting. I want to go in and do a lot of listening. I will be very clear about what we see developing, but that's the whole reason I am making the trip instead of just sitting in Washington reading news reports, intelligence reports or analyst reports.\"\nChinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said Wednesday it was \"natural that China and the U.S. have differences in different times and aspects as two big countries.\" He said, The key part is solving the issues between the U.S. and China with mutual respect. We have always believed that the bilateral relationship can benefit both countries and both peoples.\" \nXi said China will remain on a path of peaceful development and not pursue expansionism and colonialism, Chinese state media outlet Xinhua reported, adding that common ground between the two countries far outweighs differences. Xi said he hoped the two militaries would strengthen communication, increase mutual trust, deepen cooperation, and promote military ties to be a stabilizer of bilateral relations, according to Xinhua. \nThe Chinese president said, according to Xinhua, that Chinas stance is steadfast and clear-cut when it comes to China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and that \"any inch of territory passed down from ancestors can not be lost while we want nothing from others. China claims historical sovereignty over the South China Sea, including man-made islands, as well as sovereignty over Taiwan and Tibet. The claims are internationally disputed.\nMattis, a retired Marine general, is the first secretary of defense to visit China since 2014. After his Beijing visit, Mattis is scheduled to meet with South Korean Defense Minister Song Young-moo in Seoul, and later with Japanese Defense Minister Itsunori Onodera in Tokyo.\nRecent developments in U.S.-China relations\nIn April, Chinas aviation authority informed 36 international airlines, including U.S.-based ones, that if they did not show Taiwan, and Hong Kong and Macau as Chinese territories on their websites, there could be disruptions to their operations in China. White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders called this part of a growing trend by the Chinese Communist Party to impose its political views on American citizens and private companies.\nTaiwan has been self-governed since 1949, with a minority of countries recognizing its sovereignty as a nation independent of China.\nThe U.S. continues to sell weapons to Taiwan under the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979, according to CNN. This year, the Trump administration authorized U.S. companies to sell submarine technology to Taiwan. In March, the U.S. passed the Taiwan Travel Act that permits and encourages official visits between the U.S. and Taiwan.\nLast month, the U.S. disinvited China from RimPac military exercises which started on Wednesday with more than two dozen countries. The Pentagon said the decision was a response to Chinas military presence in the South China Sea, and its placing of missile systems on man-made islands there. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said Chinas military presence on South China Sea islands was out of necessary defense purposes and has nothing to do with militarization. \nThe U.S. has also performed freedom of navigation exercises in the South China Sea in order to preserve the rights, freedoms, and uses of the sea and airspace guaranteed to all nations by international law.\nOn June 15, the U.S. announced 25 percent tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese imports, with tariffs on about $34 billion of them scheduled to go into effect on July 6. The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative said, the acts, policies, and practices of the Government of China related to technology transfer, intellectual property, and innovation covered in the investigation are unreasonable or discriminatory and burden or restrict U.S. commerce. China also announced retaliatory tariffs on imports of $34 billion worth of U.S. goods to come into effect on July 6. \nMore on trade relations available here.\nSources: CFR China-NK, CFR South China Sea, CNBC, CNN, Financial Times, Fox News, Reuters, Xinhua",

      "Content": "During the course of wars and conflicts, parties can draft and enforce a variety of agreements aimed at reducing or ending the fighting. The terms can be confusing, so heres an overview.\nCeasefire\nA ceasefire agreement, sometimes called a truce or an armistice, is an agreement to do just that  cease firing, or end fighting. Ceasefires can be part of formal treaties or less formal spoken agreements between various sides of a conflict.\nSome ceasefire agreements are designed to be temporary respite in fighting with an expiration date already established. (For example, earlier this year, the Afghanistan government announced a two-week ceasefire on fighting with the Taliban for the Islamic holiday Eid al-Fitr.) Other ceasefires are designed to be longer-term and maintain peace until a formal peace treaty can be established.\nCeasefire agreements can be complex and pose many challenges in implementation and enforcement. A report published by the United Nations Peacemaker department outlines considerations and challenges to drafting lasting ceasefire agreements, including the need to:\n\n\tSpecify when hostilities must stop and for what duration.\n\tClearly identify who is involved in the agreement, and whether fighting with any groups not party to the agreement is permissible.\n\tPrecisely establish areas of ceasefire, whether troops need to disengage or withdraw, and where troops must be relocated if withdrawing.\n\tDecide what happens after disengagement (whether troops must be disarmed, decommissioned or downsized) as well as any transitional periods to peace are established.\n\tIdentify who will be the monitors (such as U.N. peacekeepers), where they will be located and whether they are to be armed.\n\tEstablish methods to verify parties adhering to the agreement, what happens if the agreement is violated, and possibly a complaint process.\n\tOutline how casualties and former combatants will be treated, including the release of prisoners of war. (For example, some ceasefires offer immunity to soldiers, or in other cases child soldiers need to be rehabilitated).\n\tDetermine how humanitarian aid can be delivered.\n\tEstimate the costs of implementing the ceasefire and establish how it will be funded.\n\nDemilitarized zone\nA demilitarized zone is an area established by a ceasefire or other agreement where parties have agreed to eliminate either all military presence or certain military installations and equipment, such as heavy weaponry. Heavy weapons can include tanks, mortars and rockets, flamethrowers, grenade launchers, anti-tank or anti-aircraft weapons, or other weapons that could not typically be carried and operated by a single person.\nDMZs are generally considered neutral territory that neither side of a conflict controls.\nOne of the longest held demilitarized zones (or DMZ) is on the Korean peninsula separating North and South Korea. The DMZ runs just over 1.2 miles (2 km) on each side of the ceasefire line established by the armistice agreement that ended fighting in the Korean War (1950-1953). The 2.5 mile-wide area runs about 160 miles (257 km) across the peninsula. The truce village, the site of various negotiations between the sides and with the United Nations, is located within the DMZ.\nWhile historically heavy weapons were prohibited within the DMZ itself (and only individual firearms were permitted), both the North and South maintain fortified areas just above and below the DMZ. (Occasional fighting has occurred in the area through the decades.)\nDe-escalation area\nA de-escalation area is essentially another name for an area established by a ceasefire agreement. It refers to an area where sides of a conflict agree to cease hostilities. \nIn the Syrian war, for instance, Syrian President Bashar Assads government and rebel groups agreed last year to establish four de-escalation zones where the sides agreed to stop fighting and airstrikes for six months. Some military sources also refer to the zones as de-confliction areas. (The agreement did not apply to fighting the Islamic State group.) \nPeace treaty\nPeace treaties formally mark the end of a war, and establish the terms of peace, territorial control and sometimes reparations. War reparations are payments one side requires the other to compensate the costs of war or aggression.\nFor example, the Treaty of Versailles, which formally ended World War I, required Germany to pay $33 billion (the equivalent of roughly $450 billion in todays currency) in reparations. Many historians argue that Germans resentment over the amount of reparations contributed to support for the Nazi party, which stopped payments while in power. Germany did not make its final WWI reparation payment until 2010. (The treaty also demilitarized the Rhineland, required Germany to limit the size of its military, established territorial borders, and required the Germans to accept full responsibility for the war.)\n\nSources: Al Jazeera, Britannica  DMZ, Korea Times, Reuters, Treaty of Versailles, TIME, UN Peacemaker Database, UN Peacemaker Report, USHMM - Versailles",

He said, \"We have been successful and got a mandate, adding, \"I think this has been the clearest, fairest election Pakistan has ever had. The Electoral Commissions preliminary results had the PTI party winning 107 of the 272 national assembly seats contested. The ruling PML-N party said earlier it wholly rejects the results due to manifest and massive irregularities. \nOther parties have also rejected the election results, alleging vote rigging and manipulation, BBC reported. On Thursday, Pakistan's Dawn Newspaper said the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan received complaints that in many areas women were not allowed to vote. Khan said he would investigate any claims that there was vote rigging.\nAt least 203 people were killed in violence leading up to the election, Al Jazeera reported. While polling stations were open Wednesday, a suicide bomber killed at least 31 people and injured more than 40 others in Quetta.\nWednesdays election is only the second time in Pakistans history that a new civilian government has been elected after the previous one served a full term, according to BBC. The country has been periodically ruled by the military over its 71-year history.\nAFP reported that voter turnout was estimated at 50 to 55 percent of 106 million registered voters. The Electoral Commissions preliminary results had PML-N winning 57 seats and the PPP party 29. A total of 137 seats is required for a majority. The PTI party would have to form a coalition to rule and select a prime minister.\nIn his speech, Khan spoke of a mutually beneficial relation with the U.S. and said he would hold talks with India over the disputed Kashmir region. He said Pakistan should have a kind of humanitarian state, where we take responsibility for our weaker classes. \nKhan called for all of Pakistan to unite and said, The biggest challenge we are facing is the economic crisis ... we have never had such a huge fiscal deficit. He added, We need to make an atmosphere for doing business. He also discussed unemployment and helping small businesses, and said his party would strengthen [its] anti-corruption institutions. He said the country would work to maintain and improve relations with Pakistans neighbors, including China, Afghanistan, Iran and India.\nSources: Al Jazeera, BBC",

      "Content": "Democrats from the House Intelligence Committee publicly released a partially redacted memorandum on Saturday that aimed to correct the record after committee Republicans released a memorandum earlier this month. The Democratic document concluded the Department of Justice (DOJ) did not abuse the process to obtain a surveillance warrant on a former adviser to the Trump campaign, Carter Page, and that it did not omit material information. On the same day, committee Republicans released a refutation of the Democrats memo. \nDemocrats on the committee drafted the memo as a response to one released on Feb. 2 by Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.). The Nunes memo said there were concerns with legitimacy and legality in DOJ and FBI efforts to obtain a warrant to surveil Page in October 2016. The application for that warrant was made through the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) and there were three subsequent renewals every 90 days. Page has not been indicted or charged as part of the investigation.\nThe Democratic memo concluded that the DOJ met the rigor, transparency, and evidentiary basis needed to meet FISAs probable cause requirement. It also called the GOP memo a move to undermine the FBI and DOJ that risked public exposure of sensitive sources and methods for no legitimate purpose. (More details below.)\nTimeline\n\n\tJan. 29, 2017: The House committeevotes to declassify and release the Nunes memo, giving the president five days to determine whether the release would be a threat to the national interest. The committee votes to release a Democrat counter-memo to the full House, but not to the public.\n\tFeb. 2: The Nunes memo is released (read that Raw Data here), with the approval of President Trump. On the same day, the FBI releases a statement that it had grave concerns about material omissions of fact that fundamentally impact the memo's accuracy. House committee Democrats release a response that calls the GOP memo an effort to discredit the DOJ and FBI, and undermine the ongoing investigation.\n\tFeb. 5: The House committee votes to release the Democrats counter-memo, sending it to Trump for review.\n\tFeb. 9: Trump blocks the release of the Democratic memo in its current form. A letter from his lawyer says that given numerous classified and especially sensitive passages, Trump cannot release the memo. It says given the public interest in transparency, Trump directed DOJ personnel to be available if the committee wanted to revise the memo to mitigate the risks identified by the DOJ.\n\tFeb. 24: The Democratic memo is released. The ranking Democrat on the committee, Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), says its the product of a good faith negotiation between the Minority and the FBI and DOJ. On the same day, Nunes releases a statement calling the memo an unpersuasive attempt to distract from the Committees key findings on FISA abuse. The committee Republicans also release a point by point refutation of the Democrats memo.\n\nThe Democratic memo and Republican response\nRole of the dossier\nThe Democratic memo said the DOJ met the evidentiary basis for the FISA warrant against Page due to: contemporaneous evidence of Russias election interference, Russian links and outreach to Trump campaign officials, Pages history with Russian intelligence, and another redacted claim. It also said FISA was not used to spy on Trump or his campaign, given Page had left the campaign months before the warrant application.\nThe memo alleged that a report, or dossier, compiled by former-British intelligence agent Christopher Steele did not inform and played no role in the FBIs decision to investigate Russian interference and links to the Trump campaign. Steele had worked as an FBI source on other previous cases. \nThat Steele report had been funded by the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and Hillary Clintons presidential campaign as opposition research on then-presidential candidate Trump. The Democratic memo said the dossier didnt inform the decision to investigate; the FBI did not receive it until mid-September 2016, and the investigation began in July of that year. The Democratic memo says the FBI would have continued the investigation even if it did not receive the Steele report or if the FISA warrant for Page had been rejected.\nThe Republican rebuttal alleges that once underway, the investigation was fueled by Christopher Steeles dossier. It further states that the DOJ and FBIs reliance on the DNC- and Clinton-campaign funded dossier in court filings, not the overall investigation, is the focus of the GOP memo.\nIndependent probable cause\nThe Democratic memo says the DOJ had an independent basis for looking into Page, including work he did with Russian state-owned companies while living in Moscow for three years, and that Russian spies allegedly tried to recruit Page. The memo says that only a specific sub-section of the FISA warrant mentions the Steele report, regarding his alleged visit to Russia in March 2016 while a member of the Trump campaign. The document also says it was consistent with the FBIs assessment of Russian intelligence efforts to recruit Page.\nThe Republican response said the Steele dossier was the FBIs only source for the allegations in the initial application that Page met with particular Russians in July 2016. It also stated that the Democratic memo fails to explain why if there was enough evidence on Page, the Steele dossier was cited in the warrant application, and why the DOJ did not apply for the warrant until after getting the dossier. Republicans also said that senators confirmed the Steele dossier was a significant portion of the FISA application.\nDisclosure of Steeles political motivations\nThe original Republican memo had alleged that the FBI did not disclose in the FISA warrant or renewal applications that Steeles report was financed by the DNC with a political agenda. The Democratic memo says the FBI did disclose to the judges approving the FISA warrants the assessed political motivation of those who hired Steele, while still appropriately upholding the practice of protecting a U.S. citizens information. It says the DOJ revealed to the court that the FBI speculates the identified U.S. person was likely looking for information that could be used to discredit Candidate #1s campaign. The candidate refers to Trump, and the identified U.S. person refers to the person who hired Steele.\nThe Republican rebuttal alleges that none of the Page FISA applications disclose or reference the role of the DNC and Clinton campaign, and instead, the FISA application relies on a convoluted statement buried in a footnote. \nNotification of Steeles dismissal\nThe Democratic memo says the FBI properly notified the court after terminating Steele, adding that the Republican memo cited no evidence that the FBI actually knew or should have known about Steeles disclosures to the media before the bureau made the initial warrant application. \nThe Republican response alleges the DOJ told the court four times (at the initial application and three renewals) an incorrect assessment that Steele had not been a source for an earlier, September 2016 Yahoo News article, adding that the reporter publicly confirmed that Steele was a source. It says the FBIs reliance on Steeles credibility was badly misplaced given his disclosures to the media. \nStrzok and Page\nThe Democratic memo alleged the GOP memo gratuitously mentioned intelligence agents Peter Strzok and Lisa Page (no relation to Carter Page) to imply that political bias infected the FBIs investigation and DOJs FISA applications. Strzok and Page bothleft Special Counsel Robert Muellers investigation after texts they sent each other had included pro-Clinton and anti-Trump messages. The Democratic memo says neither served as affiants on the applications, which were the product of extensive and senior DOJ and FBI review.\nThe Republican response asserted that given the small size of the team, the apparent bias of the investigators displayed in Strzok-Page text messages is highly relevant to an analysis of the investigation.\nThe Democratic memo and Republican response address other claims of what the Democratic memo calls omissions, errors and distortions, including the citing of a 2016 Yahoo News article in a FISA application and more. \nSources: Democratic Memo, Nunes Statement, Republican Charge and Response;Fox News, The New York Times, The Washington Post",

The investigation will determine whether the companys tax structure is in breach of EU rules on state aid.\nUnder EU state aid rules, member states are prohibited from granting corporations tax benefits that are not available to all companies within the bloc.\nThe Commissions press release said it had concerns that two Dutch tax rulings may have allowed Inter IKEA to pay less tax and given them an unfair advantage over other companies, in breach of EU State aid rules.\nEU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said, All companies, big or small, multinational or not, should pay their fair share of tax.

After his meeting with North Korean officials last week, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the two sides scheduled a meeting in Panmunjom on July 12 that could move by one day or two, in which officials would discuss the repatriation of remains. \nNorth Korean officials did not call or provide an explanation for their absence, according to CNN. American military officials were present at Panmunjom Thursday, the Times reported. When a reporter asked Pompeo in Brussels on Thursday about the planned meeting, he did not answer. He said Gen. Kim Yong Chol, an official he met with in Pyongyang, made a commitment that North Korea intends to denuclearize.\nAt President Donald Trumps June 12 meeting in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, the two agreed to the repatriation of U.S. soldiers remains from North Korea. Trump said last month at a rally in Minnesota that 200 U.S. service members remains had been sent back. U.S. military officials later said they had not received any remains.\nThere are about 5,300 sets of remains in the North from U.S. service members who died during the Korean War, according to U.S. Defense Department estimates. Between 1996 and 2005, U.S. and North Korean workers recovered the remains of what were believed to be more than 220 American soldiers. The two sides suspended those efforts in 2005 as the North was developing nuclear weapons. \nAlso on Thursday, Trump tweeted a letter he had received from Kim, calling it a very nice note and saying, Great progress [is] being made! In the letter, dated July 6, Kim thanked Trump for his energetic and extraordinary efforts made for the improvement of relations between the two countries and the faithful implementation of the joint statement they had signed in Singapore. Kim wrote, I firmly believe that the strong will, sincere efforts and unique approach of the two men aimed at opening up a new future between North Korea and the U.S. will surely come to fruition.\nSources: CNN, Fox News, The New York Times\n",

      "Content": "Turkey said on Friday that it would take retaliatory trade measures against the U.S. after President Donald Trump said he was doubling tariffs on Turkish aluminum and steel to 20 and 50 percent, respectively. The Turkish Foreign Ministry alleged that the U.S. measures were against World Trade Organization (WTO) rules, and that it would determine a WTO-compliant response. \nTurkey, as it determines and implements its own trade policy in compliance with the World Trade Organization, expects other member countries to comply with international rules, Turkeys Foreign Ministry announced on Friday, state-run news outlet Anadolu Agency reported. The ministry specified that it would continue to trade with the U.S.\nEarlier on Friday morning, Trump tweeted: I have just authorized a doubling of Tariffs on Steel and Aluminum with respect to Turkey as their currency, the Turkish Lira, slides rapidly downward against our very strong Dollar! Aluminum will now be 20% and Steel 50%. Our relations with Turkey are not good at this time! The president did not specify a reason for the increase. \nAs of Friday, the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) had not publicly released information about the tariff increase. \nThe lira, Turkeys currency, declined as much as 18 percent after Trumps announcement on Friday, Reuters reported, in the largest single day decline since 2001. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoan told supporters at a rally on Friday to exchange any foreign currencies or gold that they had into lira to support the local currency. \nThis will be my people's answer to those who declare economic war against us, Anadolu Agency quoted Erdoan saying.\nErdoan also claimed that the economy would continue to experience growth throughout 2018 regardless of the tariffs applied to Turkish goods. We won't let anybody deter us from our targets, he said.\nRecent US-Turkish relations\n\nThe USTR reported that goods and services trade between the U.S. and Turkey totaled $22.4 billion in 2016, with $17.4 billion of that representing trade in goods. The U.S. had a goods and services trade surplus of $2.5 billion with Turkey that year, according to the USTRs latest figures. \nIn March of this year, Trump announced the U.S. would impose a 25 percent tariff on steel and a 10 percent tariff on aluminum imported into the U.S. from most countries, including Turkey. \nLast week, the U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned Turkeys ministers of justice and interior over Turkeys 2016 arrest of American pastor Andrew Brunson after a failed coup in the country that year. White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said that due to the sanctions, any property or interest in property of both ministers within U.S. jurisdiction is blocked and U.S. persons are generally prohibited from engaging in transactions with them.\nBrunson was accused of aiding armed terrorist organizations and obtaining confidential government information for political and military espionage, according to the U.S. Treasury Department. Sanders said Brunson, who denies the charges, was victim of unfair and unjust detention. \nAuthorities have arrested more than 50,000 people in Turkey since a failed coup attempt against Erdoans government in July 2016. Twenty Americans are among those charged with crimes in relation to the failed coup. \nErdoan has said Pennsylvania-based Turkish Muslim cleric Fethullah Glen was responsible for the coup, which Glen denies. Erdoan said he would exchange Glen for Brunson. Negotiations held in between the two countries over Brunsons release did not result in a deal, Reuters reported. ",

      "Content": "The U.S. trade deficit on goods and services was $46.2 billion in April, $1 billion less than than the revised March figures, the U.S. Census Bureau and the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) reported on Wednesday. The seasonally adjusted numbers, released by the BEA, showed Marchs revised trade deficit was $47.2 billion, adjusted down from the $49 billion reported last month. April goods and services exports were $211.2 billion, $600 million more than in March, and imports were $257.4 billion, $400 million less than in March.\nThe U.S. has a trade deficit in goods and a trade surplus in services, which combines to an overall goods and services deficit. The April goods and services deficit was the lowest it has been in seven months. \nFor January through April 2018, the goods and services trade deficit increased by $20.8 billion, or 11.5 percent, compared to the same four-month period the year before. \nFrom March to April of this year, the goods deficit decreased by $1.0 billion to $68.3 billion, and the services surplus decreased by less than $100 million to $22.1 billion.\nExports of goods increased by $300 million to $141.2 billion in April, with fuel oil exports increasing by $500 million and soybeans and corn by $300 million each. Exports of services increased by $300 million to $70.0 billion in April.\nDeficits and surpluses in goods with specific countries and regions for April included the following:\n\n\tChina: $30.8 billion deficit (down $3.4 billion from March) \n\tEU: $13.2 billion deficit\n\tMexico: $6.0 billion deficit\n\tCanada: $1.7 billion deficit\n\tSouth and Central America: $4.1 billion surplus\n\tHong Kong: $2.2 billion surplus\n\tU.K.: $0.9 billion surplus\n\nRecent trade tariffs\nThe administration of President Donald Trump has implemented a number of trade tariffs this year. For a timeline of some of these actions, see our context here. The U.S. implemented 25 percent tariffs on steel imports and 10 percent tariffs on aluminum imports from some countries on March 23. After the U.S. let exemptions from those tariffs for Canada, Mexico and the EU expire on June 1, those regions have said they would implement tariffs on imports from the U.S.\nOn Tuesday, Mexico imposed tariffs ranging from 10 to 25 percent on about $3 billion of U.S. imports, including on pork, apples, potatoes, bourbon, steel and cheese. Mexico announced the tariffs last week as a response to the U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs. According to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, total goods exported to Mexico in 2017 were $243.0 billion and total goods imported were $314.0 billion; the trade deficit in goods was $71.1 billion that year. \nAlso in response to the U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs, Canada announced it would impose tariffs on $12.8 billion worth of U.S. imports in July. The EU also said it would impose tariffs on about $2.8 billion worth of U.S. imports in July. \nSources: Bureau of Economic Analysis, Bureau of Economic Analysis (March), CBS News, CNN, Office of the US Trade Representative, Reuters",

      "Content": "A fire in a detention center at a police headquarters in Valencia, Venezuela, killed at least 68 on Wednesday. Families of detainees were waiting outside for visiting hours to begin when a fire broke out. After the fire started, family members reportedly threw rocks at police. Police used tear gas and rubber bullets on the crowd, according to local woman Peguiliana Ruiz, whose son died in the fire. Venezuelas head prosecutor, Tarek William Saab, said there would be an investigation to clarify these dramatic events.\nCarlos Nieto Palma, director of Windows for Freedom, a non-profit group that monitors prison conditions, said inmates had set fire to their mattresses in an attempted escape from the facility. Rescuers made holes in the walls for some detainees to escape the fire. Palma said inmates and two women visitors died of smoke inhalation. At least 180 people were held in the facility before the fire, exceeding its capacity of 60, according to lawmaker Juan Miguel Matheus. He said he counted 78 dead. \nThe U.N. Human Rights Office of the High Commissioner (OHCHR) called for an investigation, to bring those responsible to justice and provide reparations to the families of victims. The office said there was widespread overcrowding and dire conditions in Venezuelan detention centers, and that these conditions, which often give rise to violence and riots, are exacerbated by judicial delays and the excessive use of pretrial detention.\nIn 2016, 54,758 people were held in Venezuelan prisons with a total designed capacity of 35,562 people, and 33,000 detainees were held in temporary cells with capacity for 8,000, according to the non-governmental organization Venezuelan Observatory of Prisons. The observatory said 173 inmates died in custody in 2016. In the first two months of 2018, 26 died, and 1,016 were on hunger strikes for better conditions, the observatory reported.\nOHCHR reported that in Venezuela millions of people are suffering a lack of food and essential medicines, a shortage of goods including those for personal hygiene, power cuts, and dire housing and living conditions. It added, 2016 estimates pointed to over 50 percent of the population facing extreme poverty, and inflation was reported at 2,400 percent in 2017.\nSources: The New York Times, The Washington Post",

      "Content": "Israeli forces killed 60 Palestinians and injured 2,700 during protests along the Gaza border with Israel on Monday, according to Israeli and Palestinian officials. The protests, which were a continuation of ongoing demonstrations over the past six weeks, coincided with the U.S. opening its embassy in Jerusalem on Monday.\nIsraeli forces fired live ammunition as well as tear gas and firebombs at Gaza protesters. The Gaza Health Ministry said at least 800 of the injuries were from tear gas. There were no reports of Israeli soldiers killed. At least one Israeli was wounded by shrapnel, according to Colonel Conricus, a spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). Israel said that 24 of the 60 who were killed on Monday were militants.\nAbout 40,000 Palestinians participated in what Israel described as violent riots at 13 locations along the security fence in Gaza. Palestinians threw stones, and flew kites that were on fire into Israel, according to the Israeli military. Other protesters demonstrated peacefully.\nPalestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas announced three days of mourning after the protesters' deaths.\nThe Palestinians in Gaza were continuing protests that started on March 30 and called for the right to return to Israel for Palestinians whose ancestors lived in Israel before the May 1948 war between Israel and neighboring countries. Israel has not granted the right to return.\nInternational responses\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said, The Hamas terrorist organization declares its intention to destroy Israel and sends thousands to breach the border fence in order to achieve this goal. We will continue to act with determination to protect our sovereignty and our citizens. Hamas is a political organization with an armed division that rules the Gaza territories. Israel and the U.S. have described it as a terrorist organization. \nWhite House spokesman Raj Shah said, The responsibility for these tragic deaths rests squarely with Hamas. Hamas is intentionally and cynically provoking this response. He added, Israel has the right to defend itself.\nThe EUs foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini called for Israeli forces to restrain from violence, as did the U.K. French President Emmanuel Macron said, France is condemning the violence. \nA German foreign ministry spokeswoman said, Israel has the right to defend itself and secure its (border) fence against violent intrusions, but the principle of proportionality applies. The spokeswoman said that meant only using live ammunition when other forms of deterrence had been unsuccessful against specific threats. \nTurkey and South Africa recalled their ambassadors to Israel, with Turkey recalling its ambassador to the U.S. as well.\nThe U.N. said, those responsible for outrageous human rights violations must be held to account.\nMore demonstrations are planned in Gaza for Tuesday.\nWest Bank protests\nThere were also protests in the West Bank over the opening of the U.S. embassy in Jerusalem on Monday. Part of Jerusalem is located in the West Bank; Israel occupied East Jerusalem in 1967 and annexed it in 1980. The annex is not recognized under international law and Palestinians want East Jerusalem to be the capital of a Palestinian state. Israel wants all of Jerusalem to be its capital.\nU.S. President Donald Trump announced last December that the U.S. would move its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Palestinians held protests after his announcement.\nAbbas said of the U.S. embassy opening, It is a settlement, not an embassy. A U.S. settlement in East Jerusalem.\nTrump said in a recorded message at the embassy opening ceremony that the U.S. remains fully committed to facilitating a lasting peace agreement.\nSources: Al Jazeera, BBC, BBC, Haaretz, Reuters, Reuters, The New York Times, The Washington Post, The White House",

Republican and Democratic leaders said they would continue to negotiate over the weekend. Congress plans to work on Saturday, with the House scheduled to reconvene at 9:00 am and the Senate at noon.\nPrior to the shutdown, Office of Management and budget director Mick Mulvaney said he thought there was a good chance of resolving the issue before Monday.\nThe last government shutdown was four years ago and lasted 16 days.\nWhat happens in a government shutdown?\nDuring a government shutdown, some nonessential governmental departments are closed and employees are placed on furlough, which means they do not go to work or receive a paycheck. Visa and passport processing can be delayed.\nServices deemed essential continue. These include food inspections, air traffic control, national security, disaster assistance, prison operations, taxation, electricity production and Social Security. The U.S. Postal Service still continues to deliver mail, according to CNN.\nMilitary services still operate, The Washington Post reported, though service members are not be paid unless Congress passed a special measure for them.\nDuring past shutdowns, national parks and monuments have closed at least partially. Prior to Fridays shutdown, U.S. Department of the Interior spokeswoman Heather Swift said that if one occurs, the department would allow limited access wherever possible to national parks, adding that war memorials and open-air parks in Washington, D.C., would remain open to the public.\nAbout 800,000 government workers were furloughed during the last shutdown in 2013, which occurred as Republicans unsuccessfully lobbied for changes to the Affordable Care Act.\nAdditional source: The Washington Post",

      "Content": "The Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced charges of fraud against health technology company Theranos and its CEO Elizabeth Holmes on Wednesday. According to the SECs indictment, the company raised $700 million from investors between 2013 and 2015 while deceiving investors by making it appear as if Theranos had developed a commercially-ready portable blood analyzer that could perform a full range of laboratory tests from a small sample of blood. Holmes settled with the SEC, agreeing to step down as CEO, neither admitting nor denying wrongdoing.\nHolmes did not respond to a request for comment by the time of publishing.\nIn a separate indictment, the SEC charged former Theranos president Ramesh Sunny Balwani with fraud. He is contesting the charges, according to The Economist. \nThe allegations\nThe SEC alleges that Theranos performed about 12 of the 200 tests it said it performed using its proprietary analyzer technology. For other tests, Theranos used third-party commercially-available analyzers, some of which Theranos had modified to analyze samples from finger pricking, the indictment alleges. \nThe SEC further alleges that Holmes, Balwani and Theranos made false or misleading statements to investors. The alleged false statements include telling investors that the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) had field-tested the units, which it had not, and that the company had revenues of $100 million in 2014 when it had revenues of about $100,000.\nThe settlement\nHolmes agreed, as part of the settlement, to: pay a $500,000 fine; return 18.9 million of her company shares that she obtained during the period when she allegedly committed fraud; give up majority voting control of the company; and not serve as an officer of any public company for 10 years. The settlement is subject to court approval, according to USA Today.\nThe indictment also stated that, Due to the companys liquidation preference, if Theranos is acquired or is otherwise liquidated, Holmes would not profit from her ownership until  assuming redemption of certain warrants  over $750 million is returned to defrauded investors and other preferred shareholders.\nInvestigations into Theranos\nIn 2015, Medicare examiners found deficiencies at one of Theranos facilities in Newark, California, in the testing of the clotting ability of blood. The test is used to determine the correct dose of blood thinners. Incorrect dosages can lead to internal bleeding or strokes.\nAlso in 2015, the Wall Street Journal published an article that cited complaints from unnamed employees about the companys portable blood analyzer. These included concerns about the accuracy of the tests, failures to report test results that could show inaccuracies to regulators, and disclosures that only about 15 tests were performed on the companys proprietary machines. After the article was published, the SEC began an investigation into Theranos.\nHolmes responded to the Journals allegations in an interview with the outlet, and a statement from Theranos said the publications story was factually and scientifically erroneous and grounded in baseless assertions. The company released a number of other follow up statements in response to the Journal.\nIn the spring of last year, Theranos said it had settled a case with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, agreeing to a two-year ban from blood-testing and agreeing to pay a $30,000 fine, USA Today reported.\nThe following day, it settled a consumer fraud case, agreeing to pay more than 175,000 Arizona consumers a total of $4.65 million. The consumers had purchased tests in Arizona from 2013 onwards. \nTheranos responseto the SEC\nTheranos neither admitted nor denied the charges.\"The company is pleased to be bringing this matter to a close and looks forward to advancing its technology,\" Theranos independent directors said in a statement after the SEC settlement was announced. \nThe company is currently developing a so-called miniLab, combining the capabilities of multiple diagnostic instruments.\nHolmes dropped out of Stanford University and started Theranos in 2003, when she was 19. In 2014, Forbes estimated the company was valued at $9 billion, and Holmes worth was $4.5 billion at the time.\n\nSources: BBC, Fox News, The Economist, USA Today, SEC",

      "Content": "A storm warning versus a storm watch\nWhen a storm warning is issued, hurricane or storm conditions are expected somewhere within the warning area, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). When a storm watch is issued, hurricane conditions are possible within the watch area. A watch is typically issued 48 hours before the anticipated first occurrence of tropical storm force winds.\nStorm categories\nThe following terms are used by the National Hurricane Center to categorize storms:\n\nHurricane: Also called a tropical cyclone, a hurricane occurs when the maximum sustained surface wind is 74 mph (119 km/hr) or more. There are five categories of hurricane: \n\n\t wind speeds of 74 - 95 mph; \n\t wind speeds of 96 - 110 mph; \n\t wind speeds of 110 - 129 mph; \n\t wind speeds of 130 - 156 mph; and \n\t wind speeds greater than 156 mph.\n\nTropical Depression: A tropical cyclone in which the maximum sustained surface wind speed is 38 mph (or 62 km/hr) or less.\n\nTropical Storm: A tropical cyclone in which the maximum sustained surface wind speed ranges from 39 mph (or 63 km/hr) to 73 mph (or 118 km/hr).\n\nMaximum Sustained Surface Wind: The standard measure of a tropical cyclone's intensity. When referring to a weather system, its the highest one-minute average wind (at an elevation of 10 meters with an unobstructed exposure) associated with that weather system at a particular point in time.\n\nHurricane categories\nThe Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale defines the category of hurricane (1 through 5), and outlines the potential for property damage based on wind speed. Anything above a Category 2 is considered a major storm.\n \nCategory 1 (74-95 mph): Winds are considered very dangerous and may produce some damage. NOAA further details the possible damage, saying well-constructed frame homes could have damage to roof, shingles, vinyl siding and gutters. The agency also notes the potential for broken tree branches and power outages.\n \nCategory 2 (96-110 mph): NOAA considers these winds extremely dangerous with the potential for extensive damage, in which well-constructed frame homes could sustain major roof and siding damage. Shallow-rooted trees may snap or be uprooted, and power losses may occur.\n \nCategory 3 (111-129 mph): These winds may cause devastating damage, in which well-built framed homes may incur major damage or removal of roof decking and gable ends. NOAA also notes that many trees may be snapped or uprooted, and both electricity and water may be unavailable for several days or weeks.\n \nCategory 4 (130-156 mph): At this level, NOAA predicts catastrophic damage in which well-built framed homes can sustain severe damage with loss of most of the roof structure and/or some exterior walls. Due to the increase in the number of downed trees and power lines, the agency says most affected areas will be uninhabitable for weeks or months.\n \nCategory 5 (157 mph or above): Also considered catastrophic, NOAA says a high percentage of framed homes will be destroyed, with total roof failure and wall collapse. As with Category 4, it says the areas may be uninhabitable for weeks or months due to the degree of possible damage.\n\nSources: Hawaii Gov. statement, Hawaii DOT twitter, NOAA, National Hurricane Center, National Weather Service bulletin, National Weather Service statement, Saffir-Simpson scale, White House statement",

      "Content": "On Sunday, Pakistan called in the Punjab Rangers to assist civilian law enforcement agencies in dispersing ongoing protests in Islamabad. Protests in the city, which blocked a major highway, began more than two weeks ago, on Nov. 8, as religious groups call for Law Minister Zahid Hamid to be fired. On Saturday, around 8,500 police and paramilitary troops implemented a day-long clearance operation that included the use of tear gas, rubber bullets and batons. Protesters resisted, news outlet Dawn reported, and at least six people were killed and hundreds injured, including law enforcement officials.\nThe clearance operation was launched after failed negotiations with the protest leaders. At least 150 protesters were arrested before law enforcement officials withdrew, according to Dawn. Dawn reported that five motorcycles and a car had been set on fire, and that protesters had taken two police officials. Negotiations are underway for their return, according to unnamed officials cited by Dawn.\nTwo weeks ago, the Islamabad High Court declared the protest illegal, and the Supreme Court ordered the government to clear the area to restore peoples right to freedom of movement. The court said that the government should continue to try to avoid the loss of life, concluding, it does not follow that protesters can only be removed by firing upon them.\nPublic and private schools in the area are scheduled to be closed on Monday and Tuesday due to the situation.\nPrivate television channels have been offline for at least 28 hours, and social media websites such as Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube have been blocked. After a meeting at Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasis house about the failed clearance operation, the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority announced that private TV channels would be restored immediately if they agree to certain guidelines about coverage of the protest. \nSources: BBC, DAWN",

The new regulation is part of the 2010 Air Cargo Advance Screening program, and may affect an estimated 250 flights per week, NBC News reported.\nIn its statement, the U.S. agency said it included these countries because of demonstrated intent by terrorist groups to attack aviation from them. A TSA spokesperson added that there is no current specific threat to U.S.-bound cargo.\nUnder the order, airlines must now provide U.S.-bound shipment information to U.S. Customs and Border Protection prior to loading and departure, including cargo, sender and recipient information. The TSA is then to compare shipment information against government data on terror threats. \nThe TSAs statement also noted that most of the orders requirements are already being carried out voluntarily by airlines in some countries. The statement did not elaborate on which countries are in compliance.\nSources: AP, NBC News",

      "Content": "White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said President Donald Trump was looking to revoke the security clearances of former U.S. intelligence officials, including former CIA director John Brennan. Sanders alleged that the former officials had politicized their security clearances and made inappropriate and baseless accusations that Trump is improperly working with Russia. \nSanders was responding to a question at a press briefing about Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) alleging that Brennan is monetizing his security clearance and asking Trump to remove it. Brennan tweeted that Trumps press conference with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki last week was treasonous, and alleged that Trump was in the pocket of Putin. \nSanders said, Making baseless accusations of improper contact with Russia or being influenced by Russia against the President is extremely inappropriate. And the fact that people with security clearances are making these baseless charges provides inappropriate legitimacy to accusations with zero evidence.\nSanders named five other former officials whose security clearances Trump would consider revoking: former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, former FBI director James Comey, former CIA and NSA director Gen. Michael Hayden, former deputy director of the FBI Andrew McCabe, and former National Security Advisor Susan Rice. Of the six total former officials Sanders mentioned by name, five served under the Obama administration, and one in the George W. Bush administration. \nMcCabe was fired in March of this year, 26 hours before his scheduled retirement, by Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who cited a report that said the deputy director made an unauthorized disclosure to the media and lacked candor with investigators about an FBI case involving Hillary Clinton. A spokeswoman for McCabe, Melissa Schwartz, tweeted that his clearance had been deactivated when he was fired, according to what we were told was FBI policy. \nComey, whom Trump dismissed in May of last year, reportedly also had his security clearance removed, according to unnamed sources cited by The New York Times. Hayden tweeted after Sanders announcement that he does not attend the White House classified briefings and the removal of his security clearance would not affect what he says publicly. \nSanders said Trump is exploring the mechanisms to remove security clearance of the individuals because theyve politicized and, in some cases, monetized their public service and security clearances. Brennan and Hayden are national security analysts and contributors for news sites MSNBC and CNN, respectively. Comey published a book this year and did interviews about it on news networks. Sanders did not provide information or evidence showing that the former officials used classified information obtained through their security clearances in political ways. \n\nThe president doesn't like the fact that people are politicizing agencies and departments that are specifically meant to not be political and not meant to be monetized off of security clearance, Sanders said in response to a follow-up question about whether Trump wanted to punish speech he didnt agree with. \nSources: C-SPAN, White House, AP, Fox News, The New York Times",

      "Content": "Democrat Conor Lamb declared victory against Republican Rick Saccone in Pennsylvanias special election for a U.S. House seat, with some absentee votes left to be counted. As of Friday, Lamb was in the lead by 627 votes, with 49.8 percent of the vote compared to 49.6 percent for Saccone, according to the Pennsylvania Department of State. Lamb declared victory in a speech to supporters late Tuesday night, saying It took a little longer than we thought, but we did it. Saccone has not conceded. A recount can be called if the margin of victory is 0.5 percentage points or less, according to The Washington Post.\nThe election was to fill the U.S. House of Representatives seat for Pennsylvanias 18th Congressional District until the November 2018 general election. The seat has been vacant since Republican Rep. Tim Murphy resigned last October after admitting to an extramarital affair. \nPolls closed at 8 p.m. local time on Tuesday. Approximately 230,000 total votes were cast. About 500 provisional, military and absentee ballots remained to be counted, according to county election officials. The Washington Post said the final ballots would be counted by Tuesday of next week. The earliest the state could make results official is March 26, the director of the Office of Communications and Press at the Pennsylvania Department of State, Wanda Murren, confirmed. Murren added that the official result may not be available until after April 2.\nLamb, 33, is a Marine veteran and former federal prosecutor. Saccone, 60, is an Air Force veteran, former college instructor, and currently holds a seat in Pennsylvanias House of Representatives.\nDuring the campaign, Lamb said he did not support House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). He also said he does not support the tax reform bill passed last December, and that he supports steel tariffs, gun rights, abortion rights and unions. Saccone endorsed Trump's agenda \"from top to bottom,\" according to The New York Times.\nSaccone told supporters Tuesday night, \"We are still fighting the fight. It's not over yet.\" The National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) said it was \"waiting for provisional ballots to be counted\" and was \"not ruling out a recount.\" The NRCC asked voters to report any irregularities they may have observed at polling places. \nPresident Donald Trump endorsed Saccone in the race, and held a campaign rally for him over the weekend. Trump won the district by about 20 points in the 2016 presidential election.\nLamb raised $3.9 million for the campaign, and groups outside the state spent about $2 million supporting his candidacy. Saccone raised about $0.9 million and outside groups, including the NRCC, spent at least $10.7 million to support his campaign.\nPennsylvanias 18th Congressional District has an estimated population of 707,100, including about 17,000 steelworkers, according to Fox News, and about 87,000 voters from union households, according to The Associated Press.\nIn February, Pennsylvanias Supreme Court ruled to draw new congressional districts in the state, which includes redrawing the 18th district after Tuesdays special election. These district changes would be implemented in the 2018 general election if the Pennsylvania courts ruling is upheld against a legal challenge submitted by the speaker of the states house of representatives to the U.S. Supreme Court.\nRepublicans currently hold a majority in the U.S. House of Representatives, occupying 238 of 435 seats. Democrats hold 193 seats, and there are no independents. There are four vacancies, including Pennsylvanias 18th district seat.\n(This post has been updated since its original publication to reflect the current status of the election.)\nSources: AP, BBC, CNN1, CNN2, Fox News, The Hill, The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post",

      "Content": "President Donald Trump nominated Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S. Supreme Court to fill Justice Anthony Kennedys position, which will become vacant at his planned July 31 retirement. Speaking from the White House on Monday evening, Trump said it was his honor and privilege to nominate Kavanaugh, a current judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. Kavanaugh, who was joined at the podium by his wife and two daughters, thanked the president. \nKavanaugh, 53, was nominated to the Court of Appeals by then-President George W. Bush in 2003 and confirmed in 2006, and has served on the bench for 12 years. He has a conservative judicial record, according to The New York Times and The Washington Post. Trump said in his speech that Kavanaugh has authored more than 300 opinions on the bench with a clear and effective writing style, eleven of which have been adopted by the U.S. Supreme Court, according to the White House. \nEarlier Monday, the White House said former Senator Jon Kyl (R) of Arizona would serve as a guide to the nominee, now known to be Kavanaugh, as he meets with the Senate Judiciary Committee and other senators during the confirmation process. \nKavanaugh requires a majority vote from the Senate to be confirmed for the Supreme Court seat. The GOP technically has 51 of the 100 seats in the Senate, but with Senator John McCain of Arizona absent while he receives treatment for brain cancer, Republicans hold 50 seats, while Democrats and independents hold 49. In the case of a tie, Vice President Mike Pence holds the deciding vote. \nDuring the announcement, Trump thanked lawmakers on both sides of the aisle for consultations during the nomination process, and asked the Senate to quickly confirm Kavanaugh to the court. \nPrior to his position on the U.S. Court of Appeals, Kavanaugh served as an aide to President George W. Bush and in the 1990s was a clerk to Kennedy. He graduated from Yale as an undergraduate and Yale Law School. He also teaches law at Harvard, Yale and Georgetown, Trump said in his announcement. \nKavanaugh said he learned from his mother the importance of equality for all Americans. Both of his parents practiced law, he said. Kavanaugh described his judicial philosophy by saying a judge must be independent and must interpret the law, not make the law. He said a judge must interpret statutes and the constitution as written, informed by history, and tradition, and precedent. He also said he believes and teaches that the constitutions separation of powers protects individual liberty.\nKavanaugh said that if confirmed by the Senate, he would keep an open mind in every case, and always strive to preserve the constitution of the United States and the rule of law. \nSources: NBC News, The New York Times, The Washington Post, White House",

      "Content": "Stephanie Clifford tells 60 Minutes about alleged 2006 affair with Trump\nCBSs 60 Minutes aired an interview on Sunday night with Stephanie Clifford, a former adult film star whose stage name is Stormy Daniels. Clifford, 39, told interviewer Anderson Cooper that she had sexual intercourse one time with Trump in 2006, adding that by speaking in the interview she was risking a million dollar fine for violating a non-disclosure agreement. Trump has denied the affair.\nClifford alleged that the affair occurred in Trumps hotel room in Lake Tahoe in July 2006, after the two met during a celebrity golf tournament. She said Trump had told her he could get her a role on his television show Celebrity Apprentice.\nWhite House Deputy Press Secretary Raj Shah said on Monday that Trump has repeatedly denied the affair, saying there was nothing to corroborate Cliffords account. The president doesnt believe any of the claims Ms. Daniels made in the interview last night were accurate, Shah said. He also said Cliffords account was inconsistent, given that in January she signed a statement denying that she ever had a physical or romantic affair with Trump, which Trumps personal lawyer Michael Cohen publicly released.\nWhen Cooper asked why Clifford signed the statement, she said she did so because they made it sound like I had no choice. He asked if she meant legal repercussions, and she said yes. She declined to discuss whether she had evidence, such as text messages or photos, of the alleged affair.\nThe Wall Street Journal first published an account of the alleged affair in January 2018, when it reported that Clifford had been paid $130,000 to sign a non-disclosure agreement prohibiting her from discussing her alleged relationship with Trump in October 2016, a month before the presidential election. Cohen, Trumps lawyer, had reportedly arranged the payment through a Delaware-based limited liability corporation he had established. Clifford said she was not the source of the Journal story. \nCohen said in February that he did make the payment out of pocket. Neither the Trump Organization nor the Trump campaign was a party to the transaction with Ms. Clifford, and neither reimbursed me for the payment, either directly or indirectly, Cohen said. His statement followed an allegation that the payment violated campaign finance laws, if it was made by the campaign. Cohen denied Cliffords claims about the affair.\nIn the 60 Minutes interview, Clifford alleged that she was threatened in 2011 in Las Vegas after she attempted to sell her story to an affiliate of In Touch magazine for $15,000; the story did not run at the time. Two former In Touch employees told CBS that when the magazine attempted to contact Trump for comment, Cohen had said it would be sued if it ran the story. In Touch published the interview transcript with Clifford this year.\nClifford said that a man approached her as she was putting her then infant daughter in the car telling her to forget the story. She alleged the man said, That's a beautiful little girl. It'd be a shame if something happened to her mom. When asked if she went to the police, Clifford said did not because she was scared.\nThe law firm representing Cohen sent a letter to Cliffords attorney alleging that she defamed him during her 60 Minutes interview. Regarding Cliffords claim of being threatened in 2011, the letter said, Cohen had absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with any such person or incident, and does not even believe that any such person exists, or that such incident ever occurred. The letter called on Clifford to cease and desist from making any further false and defamatory statements and to retract previous statements.\nOn Monday, Clifford filed a lawsuit against Cohen for defamation. Her attorney, Michael Avenatti, filed the suit in California, alleging that Cohen released Cliffords signed denial while knowing it was false or had serious doubts about the truth of the statements.\n\n Sources: CBS News, CNN, CNN, Fox News, The New York Times, The Washington Post",

      "Content": "Bombings and sporadic gunfire continued in Yemens capital city of Sanaa for the fifth day on Sunday, as Houthi rebels fought forces who support former president Ali Abdullah Saleh. Both groups, which were previously allies, have set up checkpoints, deployed snipers on rooftops and blocked entrances leading into Sanaa, the Associated Press reported. \nMedical officials anonymously told the Associated Press that almost 75 people from both sides of the conflict have died over the past five days in the capital. \nThe two groups formed an alliance in 2014 to overtake the capital and overthrow the internationally recognized government of President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi. Hadi went to Saudi Arabia in self-imposed exile, his government moved to the southern Yemeni city of Aden, and the Houthis set up a non-internationally recognized government in Sanaa. Three years prior to that, Hadi had ousted Saleh from the presidency during the countrys Arab Spring uprising in 2011, also referred to as the Yemeni Revolution or Yemen Uprising. \nThe Houthis and Salehs forces had been fighting the Saudi Arabian-led coalition that supports Hadis government since 2014, until the the groups started fighting each other five days ago. The groups began fighting each other when Saleh accused Houthis of attacking Salehs mosque and his nephew Tarek Saleh, a commander of the special forces, AP reported. \nThe Houthis reportedly control the northern area of Sanaa and Salehs fighters control the southern part of the city, according to AP. Houthis have reportedly taken over the Yemen Today TV station, which is associated with Saleh, and are holding 40 journalists and crew members captive, according to Yemens Press Syndicate.\nOver the weekend, multiple sides of the conflict issued statements about changing alliances. Former president Saleh said in a televised statement on Saturday that he and his party were willing to open dialogue with the Saudi-led coalition and turn a new page.

      "Content": "Michael Avenatti, attorney for Stephanie Clifford, said on Wednesday that Donald Trumps lawyer Michael Cohen appears to be selling access to the president. Avenatti released a seven-page report on Tuesday that alleged more than $4.4 million had been paid by various entities to Cohens company, Essential Consultants, since its creation in October 2016. Cohen said on Wednesday that Avenattis report was inaccurate. \nCohen, Trumps personal attorney, used the company to pay adult film actress Clifford, also known as Stormy Daniels, $130,000 to sign a non-disclosure agreement regarding an alleged affair she had with Donald Trump in 2006. Trump has denied the affair. Avenatti is representing Clifford in two lawsuits against Cohen and Trump for defamation.\nCohen, who is under investigation by the FBI, has not been charged with a crime. Cohens lawyer said Cohen has not done anything improper, ABC News reported.\nThe report from Avenatti and Associates alleged that Novartis AG, a global healthcare company, paid a total of about $400,000 to Essential Consultants. Eric Althoff, a spokesman for Novartis AG, said his company paid Essential Consultants a total of $1.2 million over a year under a contract from February 2017 to February 2018. \nAlthoff said Cohen promised access to the new administration. Novartis said it determined after a meeting with Cohen in March 2017 that he would be unable to provide the services that Novartis had anticipated related to U.S. healthcare policy matters. Novartis said the contract unfortunately could only be terminated for cause, such as for a default or a material breach on the terms of the agreement, so the company made payments until the contract expired. \nNovartis said Special Counsel Robert Muellers team contacted the company in November of last year and it cooperated fully and provided all the information requested. Mueller is investigating alleged Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and related matters.\nAvenattis document also alleges that Columbus Nova LLC, an investment firm, paid a total of about $500,000 to Essential Consultants from January to August 2017. Columbus Nova is a U.S. affiliate of Renova Group, founded by Viktor Vekselberg, a Russian that Avenatti alleges has an estimated worth of $13 billion. Vekselbergs cousin, Andrew Intrater, is CEO of Columbus Nova. \nColumbus Nova said it is solely owned and operated by Americans and that it paid Cohens company for consulting on potential real estate investments and sources of capital. An attorney for Columbus Nova said the claim that Viktor Vekselberg was involved in or provided any funding for Columbus Novas engagement of Michael Cohen is patently untrue. Avenatti said, We have significant evidence to the contrary. We havent released all the evidence that we have. Muellers team has questioned Vekselberg, according to The New York Times.\nAlso in Avenattis report are allegations that Korea Aerospace Industries, Ltd. (KAI) paid $150,000 to Essential Consultants last November. KAI said Wednesday it had paid Essential Consultants $150,000 for advice on local accounting standards.\nAvenattis document alleges there were $200,000 worth of payments from telecommunications company AT Assoc, CNBC, FFIEC, Novartis, Reuters, The Daily Caller, The Washington Post",

      "Content": "On Friday, the House Intelligence Committee released a partially redacted version of a final report on its investigation into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. The 253-page report was authored by the Republican majority members of the House Intelligence Committee. The committee Democrats released a separate 98-page unclassified Minority Views report on Friday, saying the Majoritys investigation ended prematurely and that the minority would continue its investigation.\nThe Committees report lists 44 findings and 26 recommendations in five chapters: Russian campaigns in Europe, Russia attacks the United States, America reacts, Campaign links with Russia and Intelligence community assessment leaks. The public release of the document follows the draft report released in March.\nFindings\nAmong other things, the final majority report found:\n\n\tThere was no evidence that the Trump campaign colluded, coordinated, or conspired with the Russian government. \n\tThere were failings in intelligence procedures and technique used in the Intelligence Community Assessment (ICA) produced in January 2017, specifically in judgments regarding Russian President Vladimir Putins strategic objectives for disrupting the U.S. election.\n\tThe governments response to the Russian active measures campaign during the 2016 election was slow. \n\tSeveral of the contacts between Trump associates and Russians  or their proxies, including WikiLeaks  were ill-advised. \n\tLeaks of classified information alleging Russian intentions to help elect candidate Trump increased after the election and leaks have damaged national security and potentially endangered lives.\n\nThe Minority Views document addressed two of the reports claims, saying:\n\n\tThere was unprecedented effort by the Russian government ... to gain entree to and influence with individuals associated with the Trump campaign and willingness by Trump campaign officials to accept those overtures.\n\tThe Minority found no evidence that calls into question the quality and reliability of the ICAs underlying reporting and key judgments.\n\nRecommendations\nThe Committees report includes recommendations in the following areas:\n\n\timproving election security to protect from cyber threats\n\tincreasing campaign finance transparency\n\tcounterintelligence practices regarding media disclosure\n\nResponse to final report\nPresident Donald Trump tweeted on Friday, Just Out: House Intelligence Committee Report released. No evidence that the Trump Campaign colluded, coordinated or conspired with Russia. Clinton Campaign paid for Opposition Research obtained from Russia- Wow! A total Witch Hunt! MUST END NOW!\nRep. Mike Conaway (R-Texas) said the intelligence community redacted too much of the document before its public release. I am extremely disappointed with the overzealous redactions made by the [intelligence community]. Many of the redactions include information that is publicly available, such as witness names and information previously declassified  I will continue to challenge the [intelligence community]s many unnecessary redactions with the hopes of releasing more of the report in the coming months, Conaway said.\nRep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), the top ranking minority member of the committee, said, Throughout the investigation, Committee Republicans chose not to seriously investigate  or even see, when in plain sight  evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, instead adopting the role of defense counsel for key investigation witnesses.\nSources: House Intelligence Committee Report, Minority Views Report, Fox News, The New York Times, The Washington Post",

      "Content": "A woman named Danielle in Portland, Oregon, said one of her Amazon Echo Dot devices had, without her knowledge, recorded a conversation she had in her home with her husband and sent it to the phone of one of her husbands employees. She said the employee called her and her husband about the recording, saying he heard them discussing hardwood floors. Amazon issued a statement describing an unlikely  string of events to explain the incident.\nAccording to Amazons website, the Echo Dot smart speaker is a hands-free, voice-controlled device with a built-in speaker that uses Alexa [voice assistant] to play music, control smart home devices, make calls, send and receive messages, provide information  and more. When the device hears its wake word, set to Alexa by default, it begins sending incoming audio to a cloud-based computing system that records and processes it to recognize what is being said. A light ring at the top of the cylindrical device indicates when it is recording. The company said a unit does not record audio until it hears the wake word.\nAfter Danielle was informed of the recorded conversation, the family disconnected its Echo devices and notified Amazon of what had happened.\nIn a statement on Thursday, Amazon offered the following points regarding the incident: Echo woke up due to a word in background conversation sounding like Alexa. Then, the subsequent conversation was heard as a send message request. At which point, Alexa said out loud To whom? At which point, the background conversation was interpreted as a name in the customers contact list. Alexa then asked out loud, [contact name], right? Alexa then interpreted background conversation as right. \nAmazon added, As unlikely as this string of events is, we are evaluating options to make this case even less likely.\nDanielle later told KIRO7, a Seattle-based television news station, that one of the Echo units was next to her with the volume set to seven out of 10 at the time of the conversation. She said she did not hear the device ask permission to send the audio.\nAmazon offered to refund Danielle for her five Echo Dots after she requested it, KIRO7 reported.\nLast month, Amazon said it fixed a separate issue with Echo devices after researchers found that developers could make an Echo continue to listen to conversations after users woke Alexa; if people did not see the devices light ring light up, they would not know it continued recording. The Checkmarx researchers said the issue was resolved by Amazon as of April 10, CNET reported.\nAmazon provides instructions on its website for reviewing and deleting audio recorded by Echo devices. The company said, When you use an Alexa device, we keep the voice recordings associated with your account to improve the accuracy of the results provided to you and to improve our services. If you delete these recordings, it may degrade your experience using voice features. \nSources: CNET, KIRO7, The Guardian, The New York Times, The Washington Post, USA Today",

      "Content": "Members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) committed to better share defense costs on Wednesday, the first of a two-day meeting at NATOs Brussels headquarters. The member countries said they were committed to improving the balance of sharing the costs and responsibilities of alliance membership, according to a declaration they signed.\n\nNATO countries agreed in 2014 to increase their defense spending to 2 percent of their gross domestic products (GDP) by 2024. Last year, five of the 29 NATO member countries spent at least 2 percent of their GDP on defense: Britain, Estonia, Greece, Poland, and the U.S. \nEight members are expected to spend the 2 percent GDP amount in 2018, and NATO estimated that 15 members were on track to meet the 2024 goal, Fox News reported. The eight countries expected to reach the goal this year are Britain, Estonia, Greece, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania and the US., Deutsche Welle reported. \nAt the NATO meeting, U.S. President Donald Trump suggested that countries not only meet their commitment of 2 percent of their GDP on defense spending, but that they increase it to 4 percent, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said. Trump wants to see our allies share more of the burden and at a very minimum meet their already stated obligations.\" \nNATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said countries agreed to pledge to 2 percent. Lets start with that, he said, adding we have a way to go.\nThe U.S. spent about 3.1 percent of its GDP on its military in 2017, according to The World Bank. Trump said the U.S is spending 4.2 percent of its GDP on defense in actual numbers, without elaborating on what he meant by that term. The day before the NATO summit, the U.S. Senate voted on Tuesday 97-2 to pass a non-binding resolution that reaffirmed the commitment of the U.S. to NATO.\nOn Wednesday, Trump tweeted, Why are there only 5 out of 29 countries that have met their commitment? The U.S. is paying for Europes protection, then loses billions on Trade. Must pay 2% of GDP IMMEDIATELY, not by 2025. \nTrump mentioned Germany in the same tweet. Germany spends about 1.24 percent of its GDP on its military. In 2017, Germany had a surplus of $63.7 billion in trade of goods with the U.S., according to the U.S. Census Bureau.\nGerman Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen said Germany contributed the second-highest number of troops to NATO and has been its second-largest net contributor.\nGas pipeline from Russia to Germany\nIn the Wednesday tweet, Trump also said, What good is NATO if Germany is paying Russia billions of dollars for gas and energy?\nTrump was referring to the the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which will add two pipelines to the existing Nord Stream pipeline from Russia, and increase capacity to 3.9 trillion cubic feet of gas per year. The new pipelines in the Baltic Sea may begin delivering natural gas from Russia to Germany in late 2019, according to German newspaper Deutsche Welle. The project was opposed by the Obama administration and some European countries, such as Poland. \nGermany, as far as Im concerned, is captive to Russia because its getting so much of its energy from Russia, Trump told NATO head Stoltenberg. We have to talk about the billions and billions of dollars thats being paid to the country were supposed to be protecting you against.  I think its something that NATO has to look at.\nTrump said Germany would be getting between 60 and 70 percent of its energy from Russia and the new pipeline. Germany has said it is diversifying its natural gas supplies, and that right now it gets about nine percent of its energy from Russia. It also said the U.S. is trying to sell Germany liquified natural gas.\nGerman Foreign Minister Heiko Maas tweeted, We are no captives  neither of Russia nor of the United States.\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel, who grew up in East Germany, said, I myself experienced a part of Germany that was controlled by the Soviet Union, and I am very happy today that we are united in freedom as the Federal Republic of Germany. We decide our own policies and make our own decisions, and thats very good.\nOther discussions at the Wednesday meeting\nTrump and French President Emmanuel Macron held a bilateral meeting on Wednesday, after which Trump met with Merkel for about an hour in a bilateral meeting. After the talks with Merkel, Trump called the meeting great, and said they discussed military expenditures and trade. We have a very, very good relationship, he said. Merkel said the U.S. and Germany are good partners, and we wish to continue cooperating in the future.\nAlso at the Wednesday meeting, NATO invited Macedonia to begin talks to join the group and decided to start a new NATO training mission in Iraq with several hundred trainers to counter terrorism and maintain stability. \nOn Thursday, NATO leaders are scheduled to meet with the presidents of Georgia and Ukraine, and hold a meeting of all nations contributing to the Resolute Support Mission in Afghanistan.\nTrump is scheduled to visit Britain after the NATO summit, and meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki on Monday.\nSources: Deutsche Welle, Fox News, NATO 1, NATO 2, The New York Times, The White House",

      "Content": "Reporters Without Borders, an international non-profit agency that tracks and advocates for freedom of the press, has published an annual World Press Freedom Index since 2002. \nAccording to the group, which goes by its French initials RSF, the index ranks 180 countries according to the level of freedom available to journalists and acts as a snapshot of the media freedom situation based on an evaluation of pluralism, independence of the media, quality of legislative framework and safety of journalists in each country. (RSF also notes that the index does not reflect or measure the quality of journalism.)\nIn journalism, the term pluralism can refer to the representation of varied opinions and ideologies, or to the diversity of media owners and independent editorial decision makers in a country overall, according to the Dutch-based Mediamonitor group. The latter is particularly relevant in countries where all or most of the media is state-owned and state-run. \nThe countries with the most and least press freedom \nAccording to the RSFs 2018 World Press Freedom Index, the five countries with the most press freedom are (in order): Norway, Sweden, The Netherlands, Finland, and Switzerland. Those with the least press freedom in 2018 are: North Korea, Eritrea, Turkmenistan, Syria, and China. \nOn the list, the United States ranks 45th, Canada is 18th and the United Kingdom ranks 40th, to give a few more examples. Myanmar ranked 137 out of 180.\nIn order to determine where a country falls on the list, RSF gives each country a score from zero to 100, with zero representing the highest degree of freedom the press could have. At the top of the list, Norway received of 7.63, while North Korea earned 88.87. The U.S., by comparison, received 23.73, Canada had a 15.28, and Myanmar had 43.15. \nThe RSFs methodology for compiling the index includes sending questionnaires to journalists and media lawyers, as well as analyzing alleged abuses. \nPractices of limiting press freedoms\nThe RSF rankings can help people understand the state of press freedom around the world, but people might wonder what they actually mean, and how press freedom is limited or increased in practice. The following are several ways in which they can be limited, from more overt to more subtle. \nKillings and abductions\nIn some parts of the world, journalists (including those who write stories critical of the government or other groups in power) can be killed or can go missing. \nAccording to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), a non-profit group that tracks threats to journalists, 26 journalists and media workers around the world have been confirmed as murdered so far in 2018. Since the CPJ began tracking this information in 1992, more than 1,300 journalists and media workers have been killed, including 847 confirmed murders. Another 60 journalists went missing during those years. \nImprisonments\nIn some cases in which journalists are convicted of crimes and jailed, the judicial system is accused of trying to silence them through false charges. The CPJ reports that in 2017, there were 262 imprisoned journalists. The most were in Turkey, where the country limited certain press freedoms and closed more than 100 media outlets after a failed military coup attempt against Recep Tayyip Erdoans government in 2016. (The government also fired tens of thousands of public workers, including judges and military officers.)\nAccording to RSF figures, there were 157 journalists, 143 citizens journalists and 19 media assistants imprisoned in 2018 as of September.\nAlso this year, Malaysia jailed a YouTube commentator for a week in the countrys first conviction under a new fake news law. (He had misstated how long it took police to respond to an accident, which he said was a mistake.)\n\nLimiting access\nCensorship can take various forms and has changed with improvements to technology. For example, for decades the Mexican government held a monopoly on newsprint, the physical paper on which newspapers are printed. This gave the government a high level of control over which news outlets could purchase the paper. (President Carlos Salinas de Gortaris government changed this in 1990, allowing publications to purchase newsprint from international sources.)\nWith newer technological advances, governments can block internet access so people cannot receive news from certain news outlets (local or international), or even limit access to the internet in general. China, for example, blocks access to certain websites with content critical of the governments actions. Since 2017, Egypt has blocked hundred of websites, including news sites, for allegedly allegedly supporting terrorism.\nCuba only this year began allowing limited internet access on mobile phones, and internet access is financially inaccesible to much of the population. (The government telecommunication company charges companies and embassies $45 a month for four gigabytes of data, and mobile hotspots cost $1 an hour; the average worker in Cuba earns $30 per month.)\nOther forms of censorship\nNews outlets can also be closed or taken over in a variety of ways. In 2016, for instance, the Turkish government took over publication of news outlet Zaman, which had been publishing criticism of Erdoan, and continued publishing prioritizing positive content without mentioning the change in leadership. \nIn another example, the Cambodian government closed one newspaper after it alleged the company owed $6.3 million in back taxes and gave it 30 days to pay. The paper said the tax bill was false. \nIn some cases, governments have revoked press credentials (which allow reporters access to certain events and documents), and critics have called this a form of censorship. Last year, for instance, Israel announced plans to close Al Jazeeras offices and revoke press credentials from the companys journalists. \nLeaders can also limit access of information to reporters from certain news outlets. Former U.S. President Richard Nixon, for example, told his press secretary not to allow any reporters from The Washington Post into the White House except for press briefings, after Post reporters wrote about Watergate. When U.S. President Donald Trump said he would not take questions from a CNN reporter, some accused him of press censorship. \nIs state-funded media a form of censorship?\nCountries where all the press is state-owned and state-run can lack journalistic pluralism and this can limit peoples access to information  especially information that could reflect negatively on the government. However, state-funded media in itself is not necessarily restrictive. Mediamonitor reports that governments offering financial support such as grants, press funds, and reduced tax rates can actually increase pluralism in some cases. \nAdditionally, some governments with state-funded media enact legal measures to limit the amount of influence the government has on editorial choices. For example, in Canada, the Canadian Broadcast Corporation (CBC) is primarily funded by the government. Yet it operates independently from the government, and there are legal restrictions on a regulating government council firing the head of CBC. \n\nSources: AP, CBC, CNN, CPJ Deaths, CPJ Imprisoned, Freedom House, L.A.

Saccone is running against Democrat Conor Lamb in a special election on Tuesday for Rep. Tim Murphy's seat in Pennsylvanias 18th Congressional District. Murphy, a Republican, had served the district since 2003 and resigned from the House last October after admitting to an extramarital affair.\nIn addition to remarks on why he supports Saccone over Lamb in the special election, Trump also mentioned the following topics during his approximately 75-minute speech:\n\n\tNorth Korea, including that he planned to meet with the countrys leader;\n\tthe economy, including jobs and the stock market;\n\ttrade, including tariffs on steel and aluminum;\n\timmigration, including the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, sanctuary cities and his proposed wall along the U.S.-Mexico border;\n\tdrugs, including the death penalty or life in prison as possible sentences for drug dealers;\n\tcrime, including the MS-13 gang;\n\ttax reform;\n\thealthcare mandates;\n\ta campaign slogan for his potential 2020 candidacy for president, Keep America Great;\n\this thoughts on how the media reports on him;\n\tindividuals he considers to be \"good\" or \"bad.\n\nThe rally was held in an airplane hangar in Moon Township.

      "Content": "The Canadian government said Tuesday it would buy the Trans Mountain pipeline for 4.5 billion Canadian dollars from Houston-based energy company Kinder Morgan. The pipeline transports oil from the Canadian province of Alberta to a port near Vancouver, British Columbia. Kinder Morgan had originally planned to start work this summer on a $7.4 billion pipeline expansion, which the company has currently placed on hold due to pending litigation. Kinder Morgan shareholders must approve the agreement for the sale to proceed. \nThe province of Alberta has supported the pipeline expansion, while the province of British Columbia (B.C.) has opposed it, citing environmental concerns. Environmental and indigenous groups have protested the pipeline, resulting in dozens of arrests. \nLast month, B.C. filed a case with the provincial Court of Appeals, asking the court to determine whether the province has the legal right to limit oil shipment to its coast. The case is to confirm the scope and extent of provincial powers to regulate environmental and economic risks related to heavy oils like diluted bitumen, British Columbia Attorney General David Eby said.\nAfter that, Kinder Morgan said it would suspend non-essential spending on the Trans Mountain pipeline and that it would stop its planned expansion if B.C. did not end its legal attempts to block it by Thursday, May 31.\nCanadian Finance Minister Bill Morneau announced the planned purchase of the pipeline two days before the deadline Kinder Morgan gave for B.C. to drop its attempt to block the project. The agreement is intended as a short-term purchase agreement, and Morneau said government planned to sell the pipeline to the private sector after its expansion was complete. A senior government official cited by CBC said the federal government hopes to find a new commercial buyer for the pipeline by August, adding that the federal government would provide the $4.5 billion in purchase funds if a new buyer was not found by then. \nThe Trans Mountain expansion project is of vital interest to Canada and Canadians, Morneau said while announcing the agreement. Our governments position is clear: It must be built and it will be built. Morneau called it an investment in Canadas future. He added that the decision will reassure investors that Canada respects the rule of law and gets big, important things done. He said the government would support the project for the workers counting on it for the summer construction season.\nKinder Morgan CEO Steve Kean said of the agreement, the outcome we have reached represents the best opportunity to complete the expansion project and realize the great national economic benefits promised by it. He added, Our Canadian employees and contractors  will now resume work in executing this important Canadian project.\nResponse to the deal\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau tweeted, Today, we've taken action to create and protect jobs in Alberta and B.C., and restart construction on the TMX pipeline expansion, a vital project in the national interest.\nAlberta Premier Rachel Notley said, pipeline spills are less and less frequent, and the technology around new pipelines is improving every day. She added, Just as with any kind of project, there is risk. The risk is very low here.\nJagmeet Singh, leader of the federal NDP party, said the governments proposed purchase was a bad deal that will solve nothing. He added, Climate change leaders don't spend $4.5 billion dollars on pipelines.\nThe planned expansion\nKinder Morgans planned pipeline expansion involves building a second pipeline to run alongside 609 miles (980 km) of the 715 mile-long (1,150 km) Trans Mountain pipeline, which opened in 1953. The expansion would increase its total capacity from 300,000 to 890,000 barrels of oil per day.\nThe construction and first 20 years of operation of the expanded pipeline would result in estimated revenue of $5.7 billion for British Columbia, $19.4 billion for Alberta and $21.6 billion for the rest of Canada, according to Kinder Morgan.\nSources: CBC News, Global News, Reuters, The New York Times",

      "Content": "President Donald Trump told Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Scott Pruitt on Monday by phone to keep fighting and said we have your back, according to White House officials. Trumps call followed media reports on some of Pruitts actions since he took office, including: spending on first-class air travel, renting a condominium from an energy lobbyist, raising the salaries of two of his employees by more than 33 percent after being denied White House approval, and having an employee help with his housing search. An EPA spokesman said Pruitts actions have been in compliance with federal ethics regulations.\nThe EPAs inspector general is investigating Pruitts 2017 travel expenses. Politico reported that the government spent more than $105,000 on first-class travel for Pruitt in his first year as EPA administrator. EPA spokesman Jahan Wilcox said EPAs Protective Service Detail identified specific ongoing threats associated with Administrator Pruitts travel and shifted his [air travel] class based on certain security protocols that require him to be near the front of the plane.\nPruitt rented a condominium in Washington from Vicki Hart, the wife of energy lobbyist Steven Hart, for $50 per night, paying a total of $6,100 for stays over a six month period, according to the Washington Post. CNN reported this amount was below market value. Steven Harts firm has lobbied the EPA on behalf of an Oklahoma company. The Harts hosted a fundraiser for Pruitts successful run for Oklahoma attorney general in 2014 and have contributed to his campaign, CNN reported. \nAccording to Wilcox, EPA career ethics officials said Pruitts housing arrangement for both himself and family was not a gift and the lease was consistent with federal ethics regulations.\nThe Washington Post reported that Pruitt effectively raised the salaries of two of his employees after the White House declined requests to increase their salaries. An anonymous source cited by The Washington Post said Pruitt re-appointed the two employees using an authority he has under the Safe Drinking Water Act to hire and set the salaries of up to 30 people without presidential or congressional approval. With the re-appointment, Pruitt increased one employees salary by 52 percent from $107,435 to $164,200 and anothers by 33 percent from $86,460 to $114,590, The Atlantic reported. The employees previously worked for Pruitt while he was in Oklahoma, according to The Washington Post.\nPruitt later said he did not give the raises, rather his staff did, and that it should not have happened. He said he found out about the pay raises on Tuesday, and had changed it, without specifying what that meant. He added that there will be some accountability on that.\nThe Washington Post reported that one of these employees helped Pruitt search for housing last year, a personal task. Don Fox, a former acting director and general counsel of the Office of Government Ethics, said having an assistant work on a personal task would be a violation of federal rules. Theres a general prohibition against misusing government resources, and employees are government resources, Fox said. \nWilcox said the notion that government resources were used to assist in finding housing is categorically false.\nRecent EPA policy change announcements under Pruitt\nOn Tuesday, the EPA released a statement saying that Pruitts Midterm Evaluation process determined that previous greenhouse gas emission standards for model year (MY) 2022-2025 cars and light trucks should be revised. Pruitt announced the start of a joint process with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to develop a notice to set more appropriate greenhouse gas emission and fuel economy standards.\nPruitt said: the Obama Administrations determination was wrong. Obamas EPA cut the Midterm Evaluation process short with politically charged expediency, made assumptions about the standards that didnt comport with reality, and set the standards too high. \nThe MY2025 standards the EPA set in January 2017, which Pruitt said should be revised, had essentially set vehicle emission requirements to average 54.5 miles per gallon for cars and light-duty trucks by 2025. That determination would be based on further projections and manufacturing, the EPA report said at the time. \nA Clean Air Act waiver allows California to impose its own standards for vehicle emissions limits, and to make them higher than federal standards. The EPA said in its statement that it is reexamining that waiver.\nIn October of last year, Pruitt signed a proposal to withdraw from the Clean Power Plan of 2015, which regulated carbon emissions. Trump called last March for a review of the plan.\nSources: Breitbart, CNN, CNN,Politico, The Atlantic, The Washington Post",

Of the 11 people tried in the case, six were sentenced to death, three were found not guilty, one received a double life sentence and one was sentenced to five years in prison. The court also ordered those convicted to pay a total of 1,195,000 rupees (approximately $18,500) in different proportions to Sankars wife, his family and the government.\nSankar was from the Dalit caste, a group with the lowest social status in Indias caste system. This group was formerly known as the untouchables, until this term was banned in Indias 1949 constitution. Indias caste system divides Hindus into hierarchical groups based on their work. Historically, upper and lower class castes lived in segregated communities and didnt share food or water. Under the caste system, it was traditional for individuals to only marry within the same caste. Today, caste-based discrimination is banned under India's constitution.\nSankar met his wife Kausalya while studying. She was from a higher caste and, according to media reports, they married against her familys wishes. On Mar. 13, 2016, a few months after their wedding, Sankar and his wife were attacked while out walking. Sankar was killed by the attackers, who used sharp weapons, and his wife was injured. One of the attackers was Sankars father-in-law, who later turned himself in. He was one of the six sentenced to death on Tuesday.\nSources: BBC, Times of India, The Hindu",

She added that the agency wishes her success in her future endeavors.\nUpdate on EPA coverage\nRecent news articles have reported on Pruitts behavior in office, including incidents that some have alleged violated ethics regulations. One such incident involved Pruitts renting of a condominium from the wife of an energy lobbyist, reportedly at below market-value rates. On Wednesday, Kevin Minoli, an EPA ethics official, said he did not have all the facts when he ruled that Pruitts $50 per night condominium rental was in line with the departments ethics policies. \nMinoli said he made his determination based on the lease that stated Pruitt would occupy one bedroom. Media reports said Pruitts daughter stayed in a second bedroom when she interned at the White House last summer, and Minoli said Pruitts average rent of $1,000 per month was less than one-third of the average listed rental cost of nearby two-bedroom homes.\nOn Thursday, President Donald Trump said of Pruitt, I think hes done a fantastic job. When asked about potential ethics violations concerning Pruitt, Trump said, hes a good man, hes done a terrific job. But Ill look at it.\nSources: AP, The Hill",

      "Content": "The U.S. announced on Monday that it was expelling 60 Russian diplomats in response to Russias alleged use of a military-grade nerve agent to attempt to murder British citizen and former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in the U.K. city of Salisbury on March 4. The president of the European Council, Donald Tusk, announced that 14 EU member states would be expelling Russian diplomats in response to the poisoning. Canada, Ukraine and other countries announced similar diplomatic expulsions. Russia has denied responsibility for the attack and called the expulsions a mistake.\nOn March 12, British Prime Minister Theresa May announced that the U.K. had concluded it was highly likely that Russia was responsible for the poisoning. The U.K. determined that the poisoning resulted from exposure to the Novichok nerve agent, which the Soviet Union originally developed, and requested a response from Russia. May announced two days later that the U.K. had received no explanation from Russia and said it would expel 23 Russian diplomats. Russia then expelled 23 U.K. diplomats in response. \nUS announcement\nThe U.S. State Department said on Monday that it was expelling 48 Russian diplomats in the U.S. as well as 12 diplomats at the United Nations who reside in the U.S. The Department also said it was ordering Russia to close its consulate in Seattle by April 2. \nState Department spokesperson Heather Nauert said the poisoning was a violation of the Chemical Weapons Convention and breach of international law, adding that the expulsions were made out of unbreakable solidarity with the United Kingdom. \nWhite House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said the U.S. actions make clear to Russia that its actions have consequences. She added that the U.S. stands ready to cooperate to build a better relationship with Russia, but this can only happen with a change in the Russian governments behavior.\nEuropean countries and Canada\nTusk announced that the European Council, over which he presides, agreed with the U.K.s assessment that it was highly likely that Russia was responsible for the Salisbury poisoning, with no other plausible explanation. He said that in addition to the 14 member states expelling Russian diplomats, the European Council decided to recall the EU Ambassador to Russia for consultations. \nTusk noted that additional measures, including further expulsions within this common EU framework may be announced in the coming days and weeks. \nCanadas Minister of Foreign Affairs Chrystia Freeland announced that Canada was expelling four Russian diplomats and denying the applications of three others in solidarity with the U.K., and not against the Russian people. Canada remains committed to dialogue and cooperation with Russia on issues where we face common challenges, Freeland said.\nUkraine said it was expelling as many as 13 diplomats in response. Germany, France and Poland said they would expel four diplomats each, RT reported. Lithuania and the Czech Republic will expel three diplomats each, while Denmark, Italy, and The Netherlands will each expel two. Croatia, Finland, Latvia, Romania and Sweden will each expel one diplomat, according to RT.\nU.K. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson tweeted that the extraordinary international response by our allies stands in history as the largest collective expulsion of Russian intelligence officers ever and will help defend our shared security.\nRussian response\nRussias Foreign Ministry said the expulsions were a provocative gesture, and that the charge against Russia is unfounded. The Ministry said it had repeatedly requested information on the case from the U.K. and had not received it. A spokesperson for the Kremlin said President Vladimir Putin would make the final decision about a response.\nRussian news agency RIA cited an unnamed source from the Foreign Ministry saying, the response will be symmetrical. We will work on it in the coming days and will respond to every country in turn.\nSources: White House Press Release, State Department, Reuters, RT, USA Today",

      "Content": "A new study estimated that 2,975 people were killed in Puerto Rico as a result of Hurricane Maria, which made landfall on the U.S. island territory last September, which would make it the deadliest natural disaster in the U.S. in a century. Puerto Ricos governor, Ricardo Rossell, raised the official death toll from 64 to match the estimate on Tuesday. \nThe study was an independent investigation conducted by the Milken Institute School of Public Health at George Washington University. The researchers said the deaths, which included indirect deaths, occurred over a six month period following the Sept. 20 hurricane due to extended periods of blackouts. Power has still not fully been restored in all areas. \nThat caused a number of issues, said Lynn Goldman, dean of the Milken institute, citing issues such as intense heat without fans or air conditioning and complications to medical conditions. Its fairly striking that you have so many households without electricity for so long. Thats unusual in the U.S. after a disaster.\nThe risk of deaths in impoverished areas was 45 percent higher, according to the George Washington researchers. Death rates were also higher for people over 65. \nA previous estimate given to Congress had found there were 1,427 more deaths than average in the three-month period following the storm, and research from Harvard released in May suggested there were about 4,600 more deaths than usual following the storm. There is no standardized way to tally disaster-related deaths. The National Hurricane Center counts only direct deaths, such as from drowning and being crushed, while some governments also include indirect deaths linked to the disaster. \nRossell had stopped updating the official death toll due to claims the casualty counts were underestimated, and ordered the independent investigation. The first phase, now completed, cost $305,000, and the second phase plans to focus on the causes of death.\nWe never anticipated a scenario of zero communication, zero energy, zero highway access, Rossell said to reporters while announcing the studys results on Tuesday. I think the lesson is to anticipate the worst. He said he had made mistakes and things could have been handled differently, adding that his commitment as governor [was] to accept that criticism, but also [build] upon it. \nThe governor also said that the government had improved communications systems, created a network to distribute food and medicine in the event of another disaster, and was creating a registry of sick or bedridden people who would need urgent care in an emergency. \nRossell also noted that 60,000 homes did not yet have adequate roofing for another hurricane. San Juans Mayor Carmen Yuln Cruz also said most hospitals do not have generators. San Juan, our hospital has two generators and a 10,000 gallon tank of diesel, so we have done as much as we can do to prepare, but we're not ready, she said.\nGoldman did not disclose details of the methodology used for the research, noting that it would be disclosed when the study is published in a scientific journal.\nHurricane Maria, a Category 4 storm, was estimated to cause more than $100 billion dollars in damage. The island has approximately 3.5 million residents and currently has more than $70 billion in public debt.\nMayor and White House respond\nOn Wednesday, Yuln Cruz said that while many share responsibility for the deaths, she alleged that people in power, including the governor, did not do enough to request aid at the time. \nThe administration killed the Puerto Ricans with neglect, Cruz alleged. The Trump administration led us to believe they were helping when they weren't up to par, and they didn't allow other countries to help us. \nFollowing the George Washington University report, the White House said in a statement that President Donald Trump remains proud of all of the work the Federal family undertook to help our fellow citizens in Puerto Rico. Trump also told reporters, Were still helping Puerto Rico, saying the federal government did a fantastic job in response and put billions and billions of dollars into Puerto Rico. He also said it was more difficult to respond to than hurricanes in Florida or Texas because Puerto Rico is an island. \nIn October, Congress passed a $36.5 billion dollar hurricane and wildfire relief bill, which directed $18.7 billion to the Federal Emergency Management Agencys (FEMA) disaster relief fund. The FEMA fund would address multiple disasters, not just Puerto Rico. \nIn February, the federal government granted a $16 package to Puerto Rico. In December, FEMA announced more than $1 billion in federal aid for Maria survivors, and in March, FEMA announced another $2.2 billion in federal aid to Puerto Rican households and businesses. \n\nSources: AP, Bloomberg, FEMA, FEMA, Reuters, The Washington Post, White House",

      "Content": "The Myanmar government said in a statement on Saturday that a family of five Muslim refugees returned to Myanmar through a repatriation camp, where they received supplies and national verification ID cards. The refugees are a Rohingya family, part of a minority group that does not hold citizenship and is not officially recognized by the Myanmar government. This is the first report of repatriation since approximately 700,000 Rohingya left Myanmar for Bangladesh beginning in August of last year. \nThe United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR) said in a statement Sunday that it was not consulted or involved with the familys return and had no direct knowledge of the event. Bangladesh's Refugee Relief and Repatriation Commissioner, Abul Kalam, said the family had never entered the Bangladesh territory and had been living in the no-man's land camp, on the Myanmar side. He said, by definition, this is not an official repatriation.\"\nLast November, Myanmar and Bangladesh signed a memorandum agreeing to the return of Rohingya Muslim refugees to Myanmar. The Rohingya began leaving Myanmar last August after Myanmar soldiers engaged in what the government called clearance operations. The operations followed an attack by the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army group (ARSA) that killed 12 people at a Myanmar police post. Some Rohingya said soldiers burned houses, stole possessions and opened fire on civilians. Myanmars military denies these allegations.\nThe U.N. and the U.S. have accused Myanmar of ethnic cleansing, which a U.N. commission defined as a purposeful policy designed by one ethnic or religious group to remove by violent and terror-inspiring means the civilian population of another ethnic or religious group from certain geographic areas. Myanmar denies engaging in such an action.\nMore information about the Rohingya people is available here.\nSources: BBC, CNN, UN",

      "Content": "One Palestinian protester was killed and 233 injured from live fire by Israeli forces on Friday during ongoing protests along the Gaza border with Israel, the Gaza Health Ministry reported. The Ministry said a total of 969 were injured on Friday. In total, 34 Palestinians have been killed, including 27 along the border, since protests began on March 30. Tens of thousands of protesters have attended demonstrations at five locations along the border, according to the Israeli army.\nPalestinians began demonstrations and sit-ins on the anniversary of Land Day. The protests are scheduled to last more than six weeks and end on May 15, known as Nakba Day. Land Day is held in remembrance of an incident in which Israeli forces fatally shot six Palestinians on March 30, 1976, as the Palestinians were protesting Israeli land seizures. Nakba Day recognizes the approximately 750,000 people who left their homes in the violence leading up to and during the May 1948 war between Israel and neighboring countries.\n\nThe protests, called The March of Return, are calling for Palestinians who left Israeli areas during and around the May 1948 war and their descendants to be granted the right to return to those areas. Israel said it will not allow the right of return.\nIsraeli snipers have shot protesters that the Israeli military said had approached the border fence. Israel has also used rubber bullets and tear gas on Palestinian protesters. Prior to Friday, Israeli forces injured almost 1,300 Palestinians with live fire, according to the Gaza Health Ministrys count calculated through computerized tracking. An additional 1,554 Palestinians have been treated for inhalation of tear gas or injuries from rubber-coated steel pellets, Haaretz reported.\nThe Israeli army has called the protesters violent rioters and terrorists, and said it was firing only in accordance with its protocols and to prevent damage to Israel's defense infrastructures. An Israeli foreign ministry spokesman tweeted, Israel will continue to defend its borders and its citizens.\nThe Israeli army said some demonstrators on Friday repeatedly attempted to destroy obstacles that the army had erected. The army said some Palestinians attempted to cross the border fence, and that firebombs and Molotov cocktails were thrown. Demonstrators burned Israeli flags and raised Palestinians ones. \nDuring past demonstrations, some of the protesters have rolled burning tires, thrown rocks and reportedly attempted to damage the border fence. Some have said they intend to use mirrors and lasers to distract Israeli snipers, according to The Jerusalem Post.\n\nOrganizers of the protests have said they are intended to be nonviolent resistance. Hamas, the political group that governs Gaza, has said it would give $3,000 to the families of anyone killed in the protests and $500 or $200 to those wounded, depending on the severity of the injuries. Hamas official Mohammed Thuraya said, This is our duty to our people, to ease the suffering of our citizens. He said it wasnt a price tag on casualties.\n\nU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has called for an independent investigation into the deaths during the protests. On April 1, the U.S. blocked a draft resolution by the U.N. Security Council that called for an investigation into the deaths of the 17 Palestinian protesters who had been killed up until that point. Walter Miller, U.S. representative to the U.N., said bad actors were using the protests as a cover to incite violence.\n\nJason Greenblatt, the U.S. envoy to the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, said in a statement, We condemn leaders and protesters who call for violence or who send protesters  including children  to the fence, knowing that they may be injured or killed.\n\nNo Israelis have been killed during the protests. \nSources: Al Jazeera, Al Jazeera, Haaretz, Reuters, The Jerusalem Post, The Times of Israel",

      "Content": "The family of Colten Boushie, a 22-year old man who was fatally shot in August 2016, is scheduled to meet with Canadian cabinet members in Ottawa, following the acquittal of Gerald Stanley, 56, who shot Boushie. After the verdict, Boushies family members said they saw no justice. Rallies protesting the verdict and calling for legal reforms were held in several Canadian cities during the weekend. In Canada, an appeal court cannot overturn a jury acquittal.\nOn Monday, Boushies mother, uncle and cousin reportedly met with two ministers responsible for indigenous affairs, The New York Times reported. Chris Murphy, a lawyer for the family, confirmed they would also meet with Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale and Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould on Tuesday. \nLast Friday, a 12-person jury in Battleford, Saskatchewan, found Stanley not guilty of second-degree murder in the death of Boushie, who was a member of the Red Pheasant Cree First Nation. According to the prosecution, Boushie and a group of friends pulled into Stanleys farm due to a flat tire. Stanley said he thought they were trying to steal a vehicle from the farm. The Times reported that evidence at the trial indicated the group had tried to steal a car at another farm, and that a toxicology report indicated a high level of alcohol in Boushies system.\nAlthough Canadian law prohibits using a firearm for self-defense or to defend private property, Stanley approached the car armed with a semiautomatic pistol and shot three times. One bullet struck Boushie in the back of the head. Stanley said it was an accidental shooting. In his testimony, he said he thought the gun was not loaded and that it went off. The Times wrote that experts were unable to replicate the mechanical failure.\nThe Boushie family cited possible irregularities in the investigation, such as that police inspected the victims home and surrounding property, and not Stanleys. They said forensic experts were not brought to the farm, and that two days of rain washed away evidence. \n \n The family and advocates have also attributed the ruling to an all-white jury, consisting of seven women and five men. Their identities and deliberations are to remain classified under Canadian law. \nThe Boushie family said it would ask for the end of peremptory challenges in jury selection, according to The Globe and Mail. Under Canadas legal system, defense lawyers are allowed to reject up to 14 jury candidates without providing justification. Boushies cousin Jade Tootoosis and Murphy said five people who appeared to be indigenous were rejected as part of the jury. \nWe expect to return [...] with a list of commitments from parliamentarians outlining the specific steps the government will take to remedy these injustices,\" Murphy added. \nSources: National Post, The Globe and Mail, The Guardian, The New York Times",

      "Content": "President Donald Trump held a celebrate America event at the White House on Tuesday, after announcing on Monday that the Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles football teams visit had been canceled. Trump said that the Eagles were unable to come to the White House with their full team for the event scheduled for Tuesday, saying the players disagree with him over the issue of standing for the national anthem. \nBeginning in 2016 and continuing during the 2017 season, some NFL players did not stand during the playing of the U.S. national anthem before games. San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick was the first to sit, and then kneel during the anthem. He said he did not want to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color.\nNo Eagles players knelt during the national anthem last season, The Washington Post reported. \nLast month, the National Football League (NFL) adopted a new policy under which teams could be fined if their players on the field did not stand for the national anthem. Under the rule, players could stay in the locker room during the anthem if they did not want to stand. \nIn his Monday announcement, Trump said the Eagles disagree with their President because he insists that they proudly stand for the National Anthem, hand on heart, in honor of the great men and women of our military and the people of our country. \nPrior to Trumps announcement, some players had announced they would not attend a White House visit. Eagles player Malcolm Jenkins said in February of such a potential visit: because its not a meeting or a sit-down or anything like that, I'm just not interested in the photo op. Jenkins also said hed met with legislators from both parties over the past two years and if politicians wanted to meet to talk about events in his community and changing the country, hed be all for that. He added, this isn't one of those meetings, so I'll opt out of the photo opportunity.\"\nThe team that wins the Super Bowl is traditionally invited to the White House to celebrate. Eagles coach Doug Pederson said on May 22 that the team would visit the White House on June 5. As the visit date approached, five Eagles players had committed to visit the White House, according to ESPN journalist Don Van Natta. (There are 90 players on the teams total roster.) Van Natta said a source told him the other Eagles players were planning on visiting a school and a community center in the Washington area on Tuesday. The team canceled the visit once Trump canceled the teams visit to the White House.\nTrump said, The Eagles wanted to send a smaller delegation, but the 1,000 fans planning to attend the event deserve better. These fans are still invited to the White House to be part of a different type of ceremony -- one that will honor our great country, pay tribute to the heroes who fight to protect it. \nThe president tweeted on the day of the announcement, The Philadelphia Eagles Football Team was invited to the White House. Unfortunately, only a small number of players decided to come, and we canceled the event. Staying in the Locker Room for the playing of our National Anthem is as disrespectful to our country as kneeling. Sorry!\nOn Tuesday, Trump tweeted, We will proudly be playing the National Anthem and other wonderful music celebrating our Country today at 3 P.M., The White House, with the United States Marine Band and the United States Army Chorus. Honoring America! NFL, no escaping to Locker Rooms! The ceremony happened as planned on Tuesday.\nResponse\nAfter Trumps statement canceling the visit, the Eagles released a statement: It has been incredibly thrilling to celebrate our first Super Bowl Championship. Watching the entire Eagles community come together has been an inspiration. We are truly grateful for all of the support we have received and we are looking forward to continuing our preparations for the 2018 season.\nThe NFL Players Association tweeted a statement on Tuesday morning: Our union is disappointed in the decision by the White House to disinvite players from the Philadelphia Eagles from being recognized and celebrated by all Americans for their accomplishment. This decision by the White House has led to the cancellation of several player-led community service events for young people in the Washington, D.C. area. NFL players love their country, support our troops, give back to their communities and strive to make America a better place. \nPhiladelphia Mayor Jim Kenney said Monday he was proud of the Eagles' activism off the field. These are players who stand up for the causes they believe in and who contribute in meaningful ways to their community. They represent the diversity of our nation -- a nation in which we are free to express our opinions.\"\nIn a Washington Post poll last fall, 53 percent of people said it was never appropriate to kneel during the national anthem.\nSources: ESPN, NBC News, NFL, The New York Times, The Washington Post",

      "Content": "U.S. real gross domestic product (GDP) grew at an annual rate of 4.1 percent in the second quarter, according to advance figures released by the Commerce Departments Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) on Friday. The Q2 figure, representing annually adjusted growth from April to June, increased from the first quarters adjusted rate of 2.2 percent. The second quarter showed the fastest quarterly growth since the third quarter of 2014, when the economy grew 4.9 percent.\nThe BEA reported that the increase in GDP growth reflected accelerations in PCE [personal consumption expenditures] and in exports, a smaller decrease in residential fixed investment, and accelerations in federal government spending and in state and local spending.\nConsumer spending, the PCE figure, accelerated to a 4 percent annual growth rate in Q2, up from 0.5 percent in Q1. Consumer spending accounts for roughly 70 percent of U.S. economic activity. \nExports increased 9.3 percent in Q2, while imports grew 0.5 percent. The Trump administration introduced new tariffs on foreign products in Q2, and foreign countries, such as China, announced retaliatory tariffs on U.S. products, including soybeans. This led some consumers in other countries to purchase an increased quantity of soybeans in anticipation of foreign taxes on the product, accounting for some of the increases in exports, The Washington Post reported. \nSecond quarter business investment also grew 7.3 percent, and government spending increased at a 2.1 percent rate.\nPresident Donald Trump called the numbers amazing and very sustainable, in an unscheduled press conference outside the White House on Friday morning. Were going to get a lot higher than these numbers and these are great numbers. \nDuring the 2016 presidential campaign, he pledged to double GDP growth to above 4 percent. My Administration remains very focused on the issues that will encourage economic growth  thats what were all about, Trump said, according to the White House. \nThe Associated Press reported that some analysts predicted that Q3 growth will decrease to about 3 percent.\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve has forecast annual growth will be 2.8 percent this year, 2.4 percent in 2019 and 2 percent in 2020. Its forecast is based, in part, on a gradual decrease in economic stimulus created by tax cuts and government spending. \nPaul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics, predicted that growth will slow markedly from mid-2019 onwards, citing the same factors as the Fed, plus a possible rise in federal interest rates. He also said that the 2.8 percent growth over the past year is a bit better than it has done recently, but is in no way the strongest growth during this expansion.\nThe bureaus Q2 figures are based on preliminary data available, and a second, revised set of figures is scheduled to be released on Aug. 29, the BEA said. \nSources: AP, BEA, The Washington Post, White House",

      "Content": "On Fox News Hannity show on Wednesday, one of Trumps attorneys, Rudy Giuliani, spoke about several topics including a $130,000 payment by Trump attorney Michael Cohen to adult film actress Stephanie Clifford. Giuliani said Trump had Cohen on a retainer and didnt know about the specifics of Cohens use of the money to pay Clifford, also known as Stormy Daniels. The payment was part of a non-disclosure agreement about an affair Clifford allegedly had with Trump in 2006.\nGiuliani said Trump paid Cohen a $35,000 monthly retainer over several months when Cohen was doing no work for the president. Giuliani added, That's how [Trumps] repaying it, with a little profit and a little margin for paying taxes. Giuliani later said Trump paid Cohen for unspecified expenses, and Trump did not know that the money was going towards the 2016 payment to Clifford. Giuliani said Trump became aware of this payment after the case became public.\nLast month, Trump responded to a reporters question on Air Force One to indicate that he did not know about the payment Cohen made to Clifford. On Thursday, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said, \"This was information that the president didn't know at the time but eventually learned.\nCliffords attorney, Michael Avenatti, tweeted on Wednesday evening: \"We predicted months ago that it would be proven that the American people had been lied to as to the $130k payment and what Mr. Trump knew, when he knew it and what he did in connection with it. In another tweet he said, Trump stood on AF1 and blatantly lied. AF1 may be a reference to Air Force One.\nPossible reasons for the payment to Clifford\nThe government accountability group Common Cause has filed complaints with the Justice Department and Federal Election Commission regarding the payment to Clifford. Paul S. Ryan, an attorney for Common Cause, said, this payment was to influence the election. \nGiuliani said the payment was about personal reputation. The money wasnt paid to help the campaign or hurt the campaign.\nFormer Federal Election Commission Chairman Bradley Smith, a Republican, said that to show there was a violation of federal election laws, election commissioners would require evidence that the payments effect on Trumps campaign was the motivation, not a motivation for it.\nTrumps tweets regarding Cohens payment to Clifford\nOn Thursday morning, Trump tweeted three tweets that together read, Mr. Cohen, an attorney, received a monthly retainer, not from the campaign and having nothing to do with the campaign, from which he entered into, through reimbursement, a private contract between two parties, known as a non-disclosure agreement, or NDA. These agreements are very common among celebrities and people of wealth. In this case it is in full force and effect and will be used in Arbitration for damages against Ms. Clifford (Daniels). The agreement was used to stop the false and extortionist accusations made by her about an affair, despite already having signed a detailed letter admitting that there was no affair. Prior to its violation by Ms. Clifford and her attorney, this was a private agreement. Money from the campaign, or campaign contributions, played no roll (sic) in this transaction.\nSources: Fox News, HuffPost, The New York Times, USA Today",

If DHS fails to do so, the court ruled that the government must begin accepting renewals and new applications for DACA work permits, which apply to certain people who were illegally brought into the U.S. as children.\n \n DACA work permit application processing for so-called Dreamers expired in March under a September 2017 directive from the Trump administration.\nJudge John Bates of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia said in his 60-page ruling that DHS discontinued DACA for arbitrary and capricious reasons and failed to adequately explain its conclusion that the program was unlawful. Bates gave the government 90 days before implementing his ruling to allow DHS an opportunity to better explain its rescission.\nThe Justice Department said after the ruling that DACA was an unlawful circumvention of Congress and DHS acted within its lawful authority in deciding to wind down DACA in an orderly manner. Spokesman Devin OMalley said the department looks forward to vindicating its position in further litigation.\nA federal district court in California in January and another in New York in February ruled the government must accept DACA work permit renewals. In February, the Supreme Court declined to review the January injunction on the discontinuation of the DACA program before an appeals court does.\nDACA is a program that provides work permits and protection from deportation for certain illegal immigrants who came to the U.S. as minors prior to June 15, 2012.\nFor more information on DACA, see our explainer here.\nSources: CNN, Fox News, The New York Times",

      "Content": "A Russian court ordered the messenger app Telegram to be blocked in the country for denying Russias Federal Security Service (FSB) access to the content of messages sent through the apps encrypted service. The ruling resulted from a petition to block the service that Roskomnadzor, the Russian federal agency in charge of communications and mass media, filed on April 6. Telegram plans to appeal the ruling.\nThe court blocked the app for not complying with FSBs requests for encrypted data, in accordance with a Russian data protection law. In July of last year, the FSB requested that Telegram grant the agency access to a decryption process to view messages. The FSB has said it needs access to some messages for security reasons, including countering terrorist activity. \nTelegram declined to comply with the requests for encrypted messages, citing users privacy and technical challenges. A representative for the company said it considers the FSB request illegal. Additionally, company executives said that Telegram was technically unable to fulfill the requirement. \nTelegram filed legal challenges in multiple courts. Russias Supreme Court rejected the companys suit on March 20 of this year, and granted Telegram 15 days to provide access to the FSB.\nAfter Fridays ruling, Alexander Zharov, the head of Roskomnadzor, said he would not say the exact time when the block on Telegram will begin, adding that it would be soon. Roskomnadzors representatives also said it would restore Telegram service if the company began complying with FSB requests for data. \nThe ruling judge, Yulia Smolina of the Tagansky District Court in Moscow, said, the court has ruled to refuse the request of the Telegram party and look into the case without participation of Telegram representatives. Telegrams lawyers did not attend the Friday hearing or a preliminary hearing on Thursday. A lawyer for the company, Pavel Chikov, said the apps founder Pavel Durov had told them not to participate in the trial to not legitimize this open farce. \nTelegram response \nAnother Telegram lawyer, Dmitry Kolbasin, said after the ruling that the legal team would obtain todays court decision, to study it and certainly, the lawyers plan to appeal it.\nDurov, the Telegram founder, posted about the ruling on his VKontakte page, Russias largest social network. Telegram will use built-in methods to bypass blocking, which do not require action from users, although 100% accessibility of the service without VPN is not guaranteed, he wrote. VPN is an acronym for a virtual private network; such networks can allow people to bypass internet restrictions imposed by authorities. \nDurov wrote on Telegram that privacy is not for sale, adding that at Telegram, we have the luxury of not caring about revenue streams or ad sales.\nTelegram has about 200 million worldwide users, and is the worlds ninth most popular messaging app. In Russia, government officials, journalists and members of the opposition use Telegram, according to Reuters. \nDurov used to live in Russia and left the country in 2014 after selling the VKontakte social networking site, Reuters reported. \nSources: Reuters, RT, TASS, TASS, TASS",

      "Content": "On Friday, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) filed a lawsuit against several Trump campaign officials, the Russian government and the media organization WikiLeaks. The suit alleges the defendants conspired in advance of the 2016 U.S. presidential election to disseminate stolen DNC data to aid then Republican candidate Donald Trump. The complaint alleges the defendants had a common goal of damaging the Democratic party.\nThe White House, the Russian Embassy and WikiLeaks did not comment on the suit, according to The Washington Post. Trump has previously denied coordinating with Russian officials. \nThe complaint alleges that Russian intelligence services hacked the DNCs computers and stole information and that Russia told the Trump campaign that its government supported Trump and was prepared to use stolen emails and other information to damage then-Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. \nThe complaint also claims the Trump campaign welcomed Russias involvement, solicited Russias assistance and maintained secret communications with individuals tied to the Russian government. Russia then strategically disseminated the stolen information through WikiLeaks, the complaint alleges. \nThe complaint names Trumps son Donald Trump Jr., his son-in-law Jared Kushner, Paul Manafort, Rick Gates, George Papadopoulos, Roger Stone, Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, and others, including ten John Does. \nForeign governments typically have immunity from U.S. lawsuits, according to Fox News. The complaint claims Russia is not entitled to sovereign immunity because the DNC claims arise out of Russias trespass on to the DNCs private servers. \nThe suit seeks compensation worth millions of dollars, according to The Washington Post. The DNC alleges the defendants actions:\n\n\tundermined the partys ability to communicate with the American electorate\n\tresulted in fewer donations to the party\n\tcost the DNC more than one million dollars to address cyber-security\n\texposed some DNC employees to harassment and death threats\n\nThe complaint was filed in federal district court in Manhattan on behalf of the Cohen-Milstein law firm. (The firm has no connection to Michael Cohen, one of Trumps personal attorneys.)\nSources: DNC Complaint, Fox News, The Washington Post",

      "Content": "On Thursday, senators introduced a bipartisan bill that would provide incentives for federal departments and agencies to uphold a 2007 law requiring them to provide data to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX.), who co-sponsored the bill, reports on his website that the bill would provide federal grant preferences and incentives to agencies that provide plans for updating the NICS system with mental health and criminal records, including domestic violence records.\nEarlier this month, 26 people were shot dead at a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas. The alleged perpetrator had been convicted of domestic violence in a military court years earlier; the Air Force did not report his record to NICS. With that conviction, he was ineligible to purchase a gun under federal law.\nFor years agencies and states havent complied with the law, failing to upload these critical records without consequence, Sen. Cornyn said. Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT.) added that the bill would strengthen the background check system.\nCornyn, Murphy, three other Democrats and three other Republicans authored the Fix NICS Act. The bill also includes an accountability measure for government agencies to report records to NICS. If the agency fails to do so, bonuses could be withheld from political appointees involved in the process.\nIn 1995, the National Criminal History Improvement Program came into effect, and in 2007 the NICS Improvement Amendments Act was implemented. Both laws incentivize states to enter records into a firearm background check system. The National Rifle Association (NRA) said it wont oppose the new bill.\nSources: The New York Times, NBC News",

      "Content": "On Tuesday, President Donald Trump signed an executive order entitled Reducing Poverty in America by Promoting Opportunity and Economic Mobility. The order calls for reform of the U.S. welfare system, including strengthening rules requiring people to work in order to receive government assistance, known as work requirements. The order instructs eight cabinet secretaries to review their public assistance regulations and guidance documents based on nine Principles of Economic Mobility.\nA White House Fact Sheet on the executive order said that adding or enforcing work requirements for able-bodied adults on welfare is an effective solution to help millions of Americans regain their independence. It also outlined the nine Principles of Economic Mobility as follows:\n\n\timprove employment outcomes and economic independence;\n\tpromote marriage and family as a way of escaping poverty;\n\taddress the challenges of hard-to-employ populations;\n\tprovide more flexibility to States, while ensuring accountability for achieving outcomes;\n\tstreamline services to more effectively use taxpayer resources;\n\treserve benefits for those truly in need;\n\tconsolidate duplicative programs;\n\tfacilitate greater sharing of information between States and localities; and\n\tempower the private sector to find solutions to poverty.\n\nPart of President Trumps effort to create a booming American economy includes moving Americans from welfare to work and supporting and encouraging others to support common-sense reforms that restore American prosperity and help them reclaim their independence, White House adviser Andrew Bremberg said on Tuesday.\nUnder the order, secretaries are to submit recommended regulatory and policy changes to the Office of Management and Budget within 90 days. Each department would have 90 days after its submission of recommendations to begin implementing them. In addition to recommendations for policy changes, the order calls for secretaries to review the enforcement of current government assistance work requirements to determine if they are consistent with federal law and the nine principles.\nThe eight secretaries to perform the reviews are from the Agriculture, Commerce, Education, Health and Human Services, Housing and Urban Development, Labor, Transportation and Treasury Departments. \nFederal assistance programs for which work requirements are currently in place or could be changed or added include Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) (welfare), Medicaid, the Childrens Health Insurance Program (CHIP) and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).\nFailure to comply with work requirements can result in disqualification from federal assistance programs. For instance, able-bodied adults without dependents must work or participate in a work program at least 20 hours per week to receive SNAP benefits for more than 3 months in a 36-month period, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). Some exceptions apply, such as for pregnant women and people with physical or mental health exemptions. The USDA defines an able-bodied adult without dependents as a person between the ages of 18 and 49 who has no dependents and is not disabled.\nThe order says The Federal Governments role is to clear paths to self-sufficiency, reserving public assistance programs for those who are truly in need. It also says it is the governments duty to either improve or eliminate policies that are not succeeding in terms of principles of work, free enterprise, and safeguarding human and economic resources.\nThe order calls for metrics to measure outcomes so that agencies administering public assistance programs can be held accountable. It adds that agencies should enforce all relevant laws so that benefits are not provided to aliens who are not otherwise qualified and eligible.\nThis year, the Department of Health and Human Services granted a waiver to Arkansas to allow it to require 80 hours per month of work, job training and/or job searching to qualify for Medicaid benefits. Maine and Kansas have work requirements for some public assistance programs. Alabama, Arkansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, West Virginia and Wisconsin are currently implementing work requirements, the White House said.\nSome statistics on employment and government assistance programs\nAccording to the White Houses Fact Sheet:\n\n\tAs of January 2018, 74 million Americans were enrolled in Medicaid and CHIP. \n\tMore than 97 percent of people who work full-time move out of poverty, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\tMore than 16 million able-bodied adults were enrolled in SNAP in 2016.\n\t28 million able-bodied adults are enrolled in Medicaid.\n\tWelfare enrollment is at or near record highs for able-bodied adults in America.\n\tThe U.S. unemployment rate is 4.1 percent, the lowest its been since 2000.\n\nAccording to the Department of Agriculture, 44 percent of households receiving SNAP benefits had at least one person working.\nIn a 2017 study, the University of Michigan Institute for Healthcare Policy found about three-quarters of people enrolled in Michigans Medicaid program were working or were physically unable to work, and 12 percent of enrollees may be exempt from work requirements due to being students or above a certain age.\nMillions of people who receive government aid are exempt from current work requirements because they volunteer, provide care for relatives, or are in training programs, according to The New York Times.\nSources: AP, The New York Times, White House1, White House2\n",

Manafort, a former Trump campaign chairman, is facing charges of financial crimes, such as filing false tax returns, bank fraud and conspiracy to launder money. Manafort has pleaded not guilty to all the charges. \nThe charges result from Special Counsel Robert Muellers investigation into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, whether any members of the Trump campaign cooperated with Russia, and related matters. The charges against Manafort do not focus on work he did for the Trump campaign, nor do they relate to alleged Russian interference. \nManafort will go on trial in Virginia for charges including filing false tax returns, failure to report on foreign accounts and bank fraud. The Virginia trial was originally scheduled to begin on Wednesday, prior to the judges delay. Manafort is facing separate charges in Washington, D.C., and is scheduled to go to trial in September there. Those charges include conspiracy against the U.S., conspiracy to launder money, obstructing justice and conspiracy to obstruct justice, all of which he denies. \nEllis, the judge, said jury selection would happen this week, as scheduled. He also approved and unsealed a request by prosecutors to offer five witnesses immunity in exchange for their testimony. This means witnesses statements cannot be used against them in any criminal cases.\nEllis also required prosecutors to submit their full list of witnesses, which totals about 30 people, by the end of Monday, according to NPR. \nSources: AP, NPR",

      "Content": "On Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump said in a speech at the White House that the U.S. would recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and move its embassy there from Tel Aviv. Trump said, I have determined that it is time to officially recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. He also asked the State Department to begin preparation to move the American embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. \nTrump said the decision was not intended in any way to reflect a departure from our strong commitment to facilitate a lasting peace agreement. We want an agreement that is a great deal for the Israelis and a great deal for the Palestinians. \nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu responded by saying, The presidents decision is an important step toward peace, for there is no peace that doesnt include Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.\nJordanian King Abdullah II said, Ignoring the Palestinian, Muslim, and Christian rights in Jerusalem will only fuel further extremism and undermine the war against terrorism. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said before the announcement that if Trump went through with the decision, Turkey could cut diplomatic relations with Israel.\nThe Palestinian National Authority (PNA) ordered a general strike in the West Bank and Gaza for Thursday. Protesters gathered in some Palestinian cities on Thursday and Israeli soldiers used tear gas against some of them. The Palestinian Islamist group Hamas called on Thursday for a new intifada, or uprising against Israel.\nOn Tuesday, Trump informed PNA President Mahmoud Abbas of the plan to move the embassy, Palestinian officials said. Jordan said Trumpprovided similar information to King Abdullah II. Abbas Fatah party said it would file a formal complaint with the U.N. \nAfter eight of the 15 U.N. Security Council nations called for an emergency meeting, the Security Council scheduled a meeting on Friday to discuss the situation. The Arab League is scheduled to meet Saturday on the same matter. Vice President Mike Pence plans to visit the Middle East this month.\nThe Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995 called for the relocation of the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. It established the option of a presidential waiver of the move once every six months if the president deemed it necessary to protect national security interests. Previous presidents have signed such waivers to suspend the move.\nOn Wednesday, U.S. officials said the move would not happen immediately for logistical reasons. According to Fox News, there are currently about 1,000 personnel at the embassy in Tel Aviv, and no facility is available to act as a U.S. embassy in Jerusalem. Administration officials said Tuesday that Trump will sign what is to be a second a waiver to keep from jeopardizing State Department funding until the relocation process begins, Fox News reported.\nTrump had previously signed a waiver on June 1. A White House statement that day said, President Trump made this decision to maximize the chances of successfully negotiating a deal between Israel and the Palestinians, fulfilling his solemn obligation to defend Americas national security interests. During his election campaign last year, Trump said he would recognize Jerusalem as Israels capital and move the embassy there.\nIsraeli forces captured East Jerusalem during the Arab-Israeli war of 1967. Israel considers all of Jerusalem to be its capital, and the Palestinians seek to make East Jerusalem the capital of a future independent Palestinian state. These competing claims to East Jerusalem are one of the disputes in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. According to Bloomberg, Senior Advisor to the President Jason Kushner and Special Representative for International Negotiations Jason Greenblatt have been working to draft an Israeli-Palestinian peace plan.\n\nSources: Al Jazeera,BBC, Reuters, Jerusalem Embassy Act,The Washington Post, White House Statement, White House Statement",

      "Content": "Jordanian King Abdullah II summoned Prime Minister Hani al-Mulki to the royal palace on Monday, where Mulki resigned after days of protests against government economic reforms. Abdullah appointed Omar al-Razzaz, the education minister and a former World Bank economist, as prime minister and asked him to form a new government. Mulki had been prime minister since June 2016.\nProtests over the course of four consecutive nights resulted in dozens of arrests and more than 40 members of the security forces being injured. The Hirak Shababi (youth movement) group, along with 33 professional associations and civil society groups in Jordan organized the demonstrations, Al Jazeera reported. Demonstrators said after Mulkis resignation that they would continue their protests.\nThis year, Jordan increased taxes on food items by 50 to 100 percent and eliminated bread subsidies, according to Al Jazeera and BBC. Demonstrators were protesting price increases as well as a proposed tax reform law that would increase the percentage of citizens who pay income taxes in Jordan from approximately 4.5 to about 10 percent, according to Al Jazeera. \nProposed tax law\nThe proposed tax reform law would lower the threshold of taxable income for a family from $34,000 to $22,500 per year, and for an individual from $17,000 to $11,200. The law would also increase tax rates for banks from 35 to 40 percent. It would increase government revenue from an estimated $350 million to $430 million by 2020-21, according to Mousa al-Tarawneh, a spokesman for the governments income and sales tax department. Jordan has a $700 million budget deficit.\nParliament is not in session, so Abdullah would have to call parliament to convene before it would debate the bill. At least 80 of 130 parliament members have signed a statement saying they would not support the bill, Al Jazeera reported. At least a majority of members present must vote in favor of a bill for it to pass parliament.\nThe tax bill is supported by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Jordan must reduce spending and raise revenue to receive loans from the IMF, according to NPR. \nJordan had a population of 9.5 million in 2016 and the unemployment rate averaged 18.3 percent in 2017, according to The World Bank.\nSources: Al Jazeera, BBC, NPR",

      "Content": "On Tuesday, Michigan State University (MSU) agreed in principal to pay a $500 million settlement for 332 women who accused sports doctor Larry Nassar of sexually abusing them. Under the agreement, $425 million, an average of $1.28 million each, would go to the women, and $75 million would go to a trust fund for any future claimants alleging Nassar sexually abused them while he was a doctor at MSU. The settlement has not been finalized.\nThe MSU Board of Trustees approved the agreement on Tuesday. The agreement only applied to MSU and to individuals associated with MSU. Lawsuits against USA Gymnastics, the U.S. Olympic Committee and other parties are pending. No confidentiality or non-disclosure agreements were attached to the MSU settlement. \nNassar had been a doctor for USA Gymnastics and a sports doctor at MSU. The school received a complaint about Nassar in 2014. It found no violations of its policies and allowed him to continue to work as a doctor at the school, with some restrictions on how he practiced medicine. In September 2016, MSU fired Nassar after media outlets reported allegations that he engaged in sexual misconduct with his patients. \nA Michigan judge sentenced Nassar to 40 to 175 years in jail for sexual misconduct in January of this year.\nJohn Manly, an attorney for the claimants, said the settlement was the result of the bravery of more than 300 women and girls who had the courage to stand up. He called the agreement a measure of justice and healing and said the claimants hope that the legacy of this settlement will be far reaching institutional reform that will end the threat of sexual assault in sports, schools and throughout our society.\nBrian Breslin, Chair of the MSU Board of Trustees, said in a statement that the board was truly sorry for what the claimants have been through. He called it a fair resolution and said, We recognize the need for change on our campus and in our community around sexual assault awareness and prevention.\nSources: MSU Board of Trustees, MSU Today, The New York Times",

Among other things, the updated version would remove duties from some agricultural exports and change customs procedures between the EU and Mexico. Negotiators plan to finalize the full legal text by the end of the year, according to the European Commission. Before implementation, the agreement must be approved by the European Parliament and the Mexican Senate. \nAccording to European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, the agreement would join Mexico with Canada, Japan and Singapore among the partners willing to work with the EU and its system of trade. Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto said the agreement may need fine-tuning in the coming months. \n\nThe agreement calls for:\n\n\tDuty-free trade on some EU agricultural exports, including most pork products, chocolate and pasta, as well as some Mexican agricultural exports, including orange juice, tuna, honey, agave syrup, fruits and vegetables.\n\tSimplified customs procedures and paperwork.\n\tIntellectual property rights protection, including protection against imitations of 340 European food and drink products sold in Mexico.\n\tImplementing the climate change initiatives both parties committed to under the Paris Agreement.

      "Content": "Polish Supreme Court judge Magorzata Gersdorf, who is 65, reported to work on Wednesday, after legislation went into effect Tuesday at midnight that forces judges over 64 years old to retire unless they request permission to continue from the president. Gersdorf said under Polands constitution, she should be allowed to remain in her current role until 2020. \nMy presence here is not about politics, Gersdorf, who has been Supreme Court president since 2014, said. I am here to protect the rule of law. Gersdorf spoke to hundreds of people gathered outside the Supreme Court building on Wednesday. They chanted constitution and sang the Polish national anthem.\nGersdorf has said the governments new law is a purge of the Supreme Court conducted under the guise of retirement reform. Poland said its judicial reforms are to counter corruption and replace judges who were present when Poland was a communist country until 1989, BBC reported. \nGersdorf was one of 11 of the 27 Supreme Court judges of at least 65 years of age who did not request presidential assent to stay in her role, according to BBC. There are 73 Polish Supreme Court judges in total. Gersdorf met with Polish President Andrzej Duda on Tuesday, BBC reported. A presidential aide later said Duda would appoint a replacement for Gersdorf.\nJudicial reforms\nPoland began a series of judicial reforms in 2015 after the PiS party came to power, including a requirement that the constitutional tribunal and prosecutors report directly to the justice minister, a cabinet position, Reuters reported. \nThe EU said that 13 new laws in Poland in two years have allowed the government to \"interfere significantly\" in the judiciary. \nThe European Commission, the executive branch of the EU, began a disciplinary procedure last year over Polands reforms that could result in the country losing its voting rights in the Commission, according to Reuters. All 28 EU countries would have to approve of the voting loss for it to pass, and Hungary has said it would oppose such a move. \nThe Commission also opened a legal case against Poland on Monday, saying the new law affecting forced retirements from the Supreme Court undermines judicial independence. The EU has said that under the new law, judges cannot seek a review of their request to stay on if it is denied by the president, and that no explanation of the denial is required. The Commission gave Poland one month to respond to its challenge of the new Polish law; the standard timeframe is two months, BBC reported. \nThe Polish government says that EU treaties do not provide the European Commission with authority over national matters such as the judiciary. Let me mention a fundamental issue, said Jarosaw Kaczyski, the leader of Polands PiS ruling party. The court system ... is an entirely internal matter.\nOn Wednesday, Polish Prime Minister Morawiecki told the European Parliament in Strasbourg, Each EU state has the right to shape their legal system according to their own traditions.\n\"For the time being our stance is that we are right, said Polish Foreign Minister Jacek Czaputowicz.\nSources: BBC 1, BBC 2, Reuters 1, Reuters 2",

      "Content": "On Wednesday, representatives from 44 African countries agreed at a meeting in Rwanda to establish a trade group within 18 months. The African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) agreement, if ratified by a minimum of 22 countries, would eliminate tariffs on 90 percent of goods and phase out tariffs on other goods. It would also replace regional agreements. Nigeria and South Africa, which account for half of the continents gross domestic product (GDP), did not sign the agreement. \nAfCFTA is the result of negotiations between the 55 member states of the African Union (AU), a continental organization. The AU has 1.2 billion people and a combined GDP of more than $2 trillion, according to Al Jazeera.\nNigerian President Muhammadu Buhari said he would wait for input from local businesses before deciding on whether to sign the agreement. Other African countries that did not sign the agreement include Benin, Botswana, Burundi, Eritrea, Guinea-Bissau, Lesotho, Namibia, Sierra Leone and Zambia.\nThree groups in Africa  the Common Market for East and Southern Africa (CMESA), the Eastern African Community (EAC) and the Southern African Development Community (SADC)  had agreed to the 26-nation Tripartite Free Trade Agreement in June 2015. Talks began the following week to form a trade agreement for the entire continent, according to Bloomberg. AfCFTA is the result of those talks.\nThe South Africa-based Trade Law Centre (TRALAC), a public benefit organization, published a summary of the trade agreement. It said that in addition to decreasing tariffs, the agreement would reduce non-tariff barriers to trade, such as those due to customs. TRALAC said the agreement would also provide a framework for dispute settlement and grant African service suppliers access to other African countries markets on no less favorable terms than domestic suppliers. A second phase of AfCTA negotiations would cover intra-Africa investment, competition policy and intellectual property.\nIntra-African trade represents 16 percent of total African trade with all countries, according to the AU. In Latin America that number is 19 percent and in Asia 51 percent, Bloomberg reported. The UN Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA) estimated that by 2022, AfCFTA could increase intra-African trade by 52 percent compared with 2010 numbers, according to Al Jazeera.\nSources: Al Jazeera, Bloomberg, Reuters",

      "Content": "On Sunday, The New York Times reported that last week, Israel gave a Times reporter and two other reporters additional information about documents detailing Irans alleged nuclear weapons program, which Israel said it took from Tehran during a raid in January. Iran has said the documents are fraudulent. \nNone of the documents Israel obtained show Iran has recently engaged in nuclear weapons development, or that the country has violated the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA).\nAccording to the Times, Israel disclosed details about how the documents were removed from Iran; photographs of a testing facility for implosion devices; the presence of warhead designs within the documents; and memos that Israel says show Iranian officials made efforts to continue research for their nuclear program after international inspectors determined it had been suspended. \nIn response to last weeks allegations, Alireza Miryousefi, a minister-counselor at Irans U.N. mission, said, Iran has always been clear that creating indiscriminate weapons of mass destruction is against what we stand for as a country and the notion that Iran would abandon any kind of sensitive information in some random warehouse in Tehran is laughably absurd.\nDocuments removed\nIsraels Mossad intelligence agency said it observed Iranians relocating the documents to a warehouse in a commercial district in Tehran beginning in February 2016. \nAccording to the Times report, on Jan. 31 of this year, fewer than 24 Mossad agents broke into the warehouse at about 10:30 p.m. local time and used torches to cut through some of the 32 safes within. Overall, the agents removed 50,000 pages and 183 compact discs of memos, videos and plans from the warehouse. The agents had orders to leave by 5 a.m., and Iranian guards discovered the break-in at 7 a.m. \nTesting facility\nReporters were shown photos of a cylindrical test chamber in a building at Parchin military base. The chamber was allegedly used to conduct tests on implosion devices that could be used to trigger a nuclear bomb. The facility had been refurbished and the chamber was not there when the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Yukiya Amano, visited the site in 2015. \nWarhead designs\nOne Israeli intelligence official said, we see explicit material related to nuclear weapons from different sources, some of it not Iranian in origin. Israel did not show the designs to reporters. \nMemos\nWithin the documents is a memo, allegedly from an Iranian official, dated Sept. 3, 2003, that says, Let there be no mistake: the amount of personnel in the overt and covert parts will not decrease, and the structure will not become smaller, and every sub-project will supervise both its overt and covert parts.\nThe end of Irans nuclear program, named Project Amad, was declared in 2003, according to the Times. \nThe document collection also contains notes from the late Masoud Ali Mohammadi, a nuclear physicist at the University of Tehran, that read,Neutrons research could not be considered overt and needs to be concealed. He also wrote, we cannot excuse such activities as defensive. Neutron activities are sensitive, and we have no explanation for them. Mohammadi was assassinated in January 2010.\nThe JCPOA\nIn 2015, the Iran nuclear agreement or JCPOA was reached between Iran, the U.S., Russia, China, the U.K., France, Germany and the EU. \nOn April 30 of this year, Israels Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the documents from the Tehran warehouse showed Iran intensified efforts to hide nuclear weapons files after signing the 2015 agreement. On May 8, President Donald Trump announced the U.S. would withdraw from the JCPOA and reimpose sanctions on Iran. \nOn July 6, ministers from the U.K, China, France, Germany and Russia met with Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif in Vienna to negotiate new terms to the JCPOA that would compensate for the resumption of U.S. sanctions in August.\nSources: Haaretz, The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post",

      "Content": "The U.S. deported Jakiw Palij, an alleged former Nazi labor camp guard in German-occupied Poland, to Germany on Tuesday, according to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). \nAttorney General Jeff Sessions said Palij, 95, lied about his past work with the Nazis and fraudulently became a U.S. citizen. The United States will never be a safe haven for those who have participated in atrocities, war crimes, and human rights abuses, said Sessions.\nAccording to ICE, Palij was born in a part of Poland that is now Ukraine, immigrated to the U.S. in 1949 and became a U.S. citizen in 1957. He initially lied to immigration officials by withholding information about his past involvement with the Nazis. Palij instead told immigration officials that during World War II he first worked on his fathers farm and later at a factory in Germany. \nIn 2001, Palij told Justice Department officials that he was trained at a Nazi training camp in Trawniki, Poland, in the spring of 1943. On Nov. 3, 1943, Nazis shot and killed about 6,000 Jewish men, women and children being held at Trawniki. By helping to prevent the escape of these prisoners during his service at Trawniki, Palij played an indispensable role in ensuring that they later met their tragic fate at the hands of the Nazis, ICE said in its announcement.\nIn 2003, Palijs U.S. citizenship was revoked by a federal judge in the Eastern District of New York, who cited his alleged wartime activities and immigration fraud. A year later, U.S. Immigration Judge Robert Owens ordered Palijs deportation to Ukraine, Poland or Germany, or any other country that would admit him, according to ICE. Palijs attempts to appeal the decision were denied. \nPalij was not deported sooner because Germany, Poland and Ukraine had refused to take him, The Guardian reported, and the U.S. could not prosecute his alleged war crimes because they took place on foreign soil. In the interim, Palij continued living in a house in Queens, New York, with his wife Maria.\nWhite House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said Palij was deported to Germany after extensive negotiations between President Donald Trump and his team and German officials. Sanders did not elaborate on the details of the negotiations.\nIncluding Palij, the U.S. government has deported a total of 68 individuals who participated in Adolf Hitlers Nazi regime, according to ICE.\nTrawniki\nAn abandoned sugar refinery was occupied by the Nazis from July 1941 to July 1944 and turned into the Trawniki camp. The camp initially served as a holding area for Soviet civilians and soldiers, according to the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum. \nBy September 1941, it became a training facility for Nazi law enforcement deployed in Operation Reinhard, a mission to kill the roughly 2 million Jewish residents living in German-occupied territory at the time. Between 1941 and 1944, about 5,082 men were trained at Trawniki to fight as Nazi auxiliary forces.\nThe facility was also used as a forced-labor camp for Jews between June 1942 and September 1943, as part of Operation Reinhard. Between September 1943 and May 1944, it was one of the Nazi regimes concentration camps.\nOn Nov. 3, 1943, the Nazis shot and killed least 6,000 Jewish prisoners housed in Trawniki and its subcamp Dorohucza, as part of Operation Harvest Festival.\n\n\nSources: U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, The Guardian, White House Press Secretary, U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum",

      "Content": "American clothing retailer Gap Inc. apologized to China on Tuesday for selling T-shirts with an incorrect map of China on them. The T-shirts showed a map that did not include Taiwan, Southern Tibet and islands in the South China Sea that China claims. Gap said it respects the sovereignty and territorial integrity of China.\nGap said it removed the shirts, which have been on sale in China, Canada and other overseas markets, from the shelves of Chinese stores and concerned global markets, and destroyed them. The company apologized for its unintentional error and said it would follow Chinese rules and laws. \nThe Peoples Daily, the official Chinese Communist Party newspaper, tweeted a picture of the Gaps T-shirt next to a map that China considers accurate and mentioned Gaps apology for printing an incomplete Chinese map. \nChinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said the ministry would follow carefully the Gaps actions and remarks later on.\nGap opened its first store in mainland China in 2010 and currently has 27 stores there. The company also has stores in Hong Kong and Taiwan.\nForeign companies operating in China\nOther companies, including Delta Air Lines, Marriott and the clothing company Zara, have apologized to China this year for referring to Taiwan, Hong Kong and Tibet as independent countries in their promotional materials. The Chinese government considers them to be part of China. Mercedes-Benz apologized to China for posts quoting the Dalai Lama on social media, which it later removed. The Dalai Lama is the Tibetan spiritual leader who lives in exile.\nIn April, Chinas aviation authority told 36 international airlines that if they did not show Taiwan, and Hong Kong and Macau as Chinese territories on their websites, there could be disruptions to their operations in China. White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders called this part of a growing trend by the Chinese Communist Party to impose its political views on American citizens and private companies.\nTaiwan has been self-governed since 1949, with a minority of countries recognizing its sovereignty as a nation independent of China. Taiwan's Foreign Minister Joseph Wu said Chinas lobbying of companies to not refer to Taiwan as independent of China was rather unfortunate in terms of cross-strait relations. He said it would move people in Taiwan further and further away from China and not win their hearts and minds. \nTibet is a region along Chinas border with India that is under dispute: China claims Tibet as its own and Tibet claims it is an independent nation. Tibets exiled government is based in India. Macau is a former Portuguese colony and now semi-autonomous territory about 40 miles (64 km) from Hong Kong, which is itself a former British colony and now semi-autonomous Chinese territory. \nSources: Fortune, NBC News, The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal",

      "Content": "On Thursday, the U.S. government said it had reunited 1,442 immigrant children with their detained, undocumented parents. An additional 378 children had been released under appropriate circumstances, such as to a parent who was already released in the U.S., or a family member or friend who could act as a caretaker. Thursday was a court-imposed deadline for the reunifications. The government said 711 children were ineligible to be reunited with parents by the deadline, for reasons such as parents no longer being in the U.S. \nThe 378 children released under appropriate circumstances also included those who had turned 18 and could be released as adults.\nParents who were reunited with their children may have included those who crossed into the U.S. illegally, as well as those who crossed at a legal border crossing and requested asylum due to violence in their native countries, including El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, BBC reported.\nOf the 711 children ineligible to be reunited with parents by the deadline, the government said there were 120 children whose parents declined reunions, 431 children whose parents were no longer in the U.S., 79 whose parents had been released from custody in the U.S. and had not been located for reunions, 94 whose parents locations were under review, 21 whose parents were ineligible for being reunited due to their background check results, 46 ineligible for other reasons, and 7 children who were affected by a separate court case, CNN reported. The numbers add up to more than 711 children, since some had multiple reasons for not being reunited.\nOn June 26, U.S. District Judge Dana Sabraw in San Diego issued a preliminary injunction ordering the government to reunite all separated migrant children with their parents by this Thursday. \nSome of the separations resulted from the Trump administrations zero-tolerance policy, announced in April, which called for all adults who illegally crossed the border to be prosecuted. Trump later signed an executive order to end the separations on June 20, ordering authorities to detain alien families together where appropriate and consistent with law and available resources.\nThe government said in its Thursday court filing to Sabraw, The reunification plan outlined to the Court ... is proceeding, and is expected to result in the reunification of all class members found eligible for reunification at this time by the Court's July 26, 2018 deadline.\nChris Meekins, chief of staff for the Department of Health and Human Services preparedness and response division, said, We expect to be able to reunify all eligible parents who were within ICE custody this evening by the court order.\nAmerican Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) attorney Lee Gelernt said, I think it's accurate to say [the government] didn't meet the deadline, the only deadline they met is their self-defined deadline.\nMatthew Albence, chief of Immigration and Customs Enforcement's (ICEs) enforcement division, said ICE has been working 24/7 on the reunification process. He said, ICE and especially [Enforcement and Removal Operations] has made a concerted effort and dedicated an inordinate amount of resources to ensure these reunifications did occur. The overall first guiding principle is the safety of these children.\nParents that did return [to their] home [country] without their child did so after being provided an opportunity to have that child accompany them, Albence said, adding the parents \"declined\" that option. Yes, they've been deported. We don't keep track of individuals once they've been deported to foreign countries, as Chris indicated, Albence said. \nAlbence also said, We cannot force a parent to take a child with them. He said the government will work with the court ... should these individuals want reunification.\nThe ACLU has filed multiple affidavits that allege some parents did not know what they were signing when they signed documents waiving their right to be reunited with their children.\nSources: BBC, CNN",

If approved, the change would allow incumbent President Xi Jinping to remain in office past 2023, when his second term ends.\nThe CCP made the announcement on Sunday via the state-run news agency Xinhua. Here is the full announcement as it appeared on Xinhuas English-language site the day of the announcement.\n\n-- Chinese President and Vice-President\nThe [CCP] Central Committee proposed revising the clause The term of office of the President and Vice-President of the Peoples Republic of China is the same as that of the National Peoples Congress, and they shall serve no more than two consecutive terms to The term of office of the President and Vice-President of the Peoples Republic of China is the same as that of the National Peoples Congress.\n\nThe CCP parliament is scheduled to vote on this and other proposed constitutional amendments on Mar. 5 during the annual meeting of the National Peoples Congress. The congress is made up entirely of members who support the CCP. Parliament would also vote then to formally confirm Xi to his second five-year term as president. \nXi, 64, is also general secretary of the CCP and commander in chief of Chinas Peoples Liberation Army (PLA). He is the son of a founding member of the CCP and joined the party in 1974.\nOther CCP proposals\nAmong other proposed changes to Chinas constitution are:\n\n\tAdding the policy guideline Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, which provides a 14-point theory for upholding and developing socialism.\n\tAdding the policy guideline, The Scientific Outlook on Development, which provides a theory for economic and social development.\n\tAdding a clause that all state functionaries take a public oath of allegiance to the constitution upon assuming office.\n\tMaking the supervisory commission a new state organ, responsible for a national system of supervision for all public servants exercising public power.\n\nXis roles in Chinas government structure\nThe CCP is the main political party in China, with 85 million members, and has the power to set the countrys policy directions and supervise the implementation of those policies.

      "Content": "On Monday, The New York Times published a list of at least 48 questions that Special Counsel Robert Muellers investigators had reportedly submitted to President Donald Trumps legal team as part of Muellers investigation into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and related matters. The Times reported that someone outside of Trumps legal team gave it the questions. \nOn Tuesday morning, Trump tweeted, So disgraceful that the questions concerning the Russian Witch Hunt were leaked to the media. In March, Trump said he would like to testify before Mueller as part of the investigation.\nThe Times reported that there were five questions about former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, 20 about former FBI Director James Comey, nine about Attorney General Jeff Sessions and 14 about possible Trump campaign communication with Russia.\nQuestions on Flynn\nFlynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about contacts he had with former Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak after Trump was elected and before he took office. Flynn resigned on Feb. 13, 2017, saying he inadvertently briefed the Vice President Elect [Mike Pence] and others with incomplete information about my phone calls with the Russian Ambassador.\nSome of Muellers reported questions for Trump about Flynn would include whether Trump knew about Flynns phone calls with Kislyak and how Trump made his decision to fire Flynn. \nQuestions on Comey\nTrump fired Comey as FBI director in May of last year, saying he concur[red] with the judgement of the Department of Justice that Comey was not able to effectively lead the bureau. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein had written a memo to Trump that said, I cannot defend the directors handling of the conclusion of the investigation of Secretary [Hillary] Clintons emails.\nMuellers reported questions on Comey involve: Trumps thoughts on Comeys Jan. 6, 2017 intelligence briefing to him about alleged Russian election interference; the details and purpose of meetings between Trump and Comey in January and February 2017; why Trump fired Comey and when he decided to do so; and clarifications about some of Trumps statements regarding Comey in interviews and tweets. \nQuestions on Sessions\nSessions recused himself from the Russia investigation on March 2, 2017, after incorrectly testifying at his February 2017 confirmation hearing that he had no contact with Russian officials during the 2016 presidential campaign. He later said he met Kislyak twice, both times in his role as a senator and not in relation to the Trump campaign. In July of last year, Trump said, Sessions should have never recused himself, and if he was going to recuse himself, he should have told me before he took the job and I would have picked somebody else.\nAccording to the Times, Mueller would ask Trump if he discussed whether Sessions would protect him, Trumps reaction to Muellers appointment (which was made by Rosenstein rather than Sessions), and what discussions Trump may have had about terminating Mueller.\nQuestions on possible contact between Russia and the Trump campaign\nRegarding communications between Russia and the Trump campaign, Mueller would reportedly ask when Trump became aware of Donald Trump Jrs meeting with a Russian lawyer in June 2016. The published questions also address: any discussions Trump may have had during the campaign regarding Russian sanctions, Trumps knowledge of alleged Russian hacking during the campaign, and what Trump may have known about any of his campaign members contacting Russia about potential assistance to the campaign.\nThe Mueller investigation has not resulted in any charges related to coordination or conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia.\nRead the full list of questions as reported by Fox News here.\nFor more background on the alleged and potential crimes related to Muellers investigation, read our explainerhere.\nSources: Fox News, The Hill, The New York Times 1, The New York Times 2, The New York Times 3, The New York Times 4, The Washington Post",

      "Content": "The Pulitzer Prize board said on Thursday it would investigate sexual misconduct allegations against its former chairman, Dominican-American author Junot Daz. Author Zinzi Clemmons alleged that Daz forcibly kissed her six years ago at a literature workshop when she was a graduate student. Two other female authors characterized comments Daz had made to them as misogynist and verbal violence. Daz said he takes responsibility for his past. The board said Daz welcomed its investigation and would cooperate fully with it.\nThe Pulitzer Prize board elected Junot Daz, 49, as its chairman in April. He has resigned from that position and will remain on the board, according to Pulitzer. \nDaz won the Pulitzer Prize in fiction in 2008 for his novel The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao. He has also written some collections of short stories, including Drown and This Is How You Lose Her. He is a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\nThe allegations\nIn an article last month in The New Yorker, Daz told the story of his rape as an 8-year old boy by a grownup that he truly trusted. At a Sydney Writers Festival session on May 4, Clemmons addressed Daz during a question and answer session. Buzzfeed interviewed audience member Abby Callard after the event. According to Callard, Clemmons said some people said Dazs New Yorker article was a way to pre-empt sexual misconduct accusations that may come against him. Clemmons then said Daz had spoken at Columbia University six years ago and asked him \"why you treated me that way, according to Callard. Witnesses told Buzzfeed that Clemmons left before Daz had answered and that he had asked her to stay. \nClemmons later tweeted, As a grad student, I invited Junot Daz to speak to a workshop on issues of representation in literature. I was an unknown wide-eyed 26 yo, and he used it as an opportunity to corner and forcibly kiss me. I'm far from the only one he's done this 2, I refuse to be silent anymore. \nClemmons also tweeted that she told several people her story at the time, and had emails Daz had sent her afterward. She did not specify in her tweet the content of the emails.\nAuthor Monica Byrne wrote about how she spoke with Daz at a professional dinner, saying, I made a point emphasizing how personal narrative is important in empowering the marginalized. He said (and this is my memory, so Im not including quotation marks), Well, I dont know if you know how statistics work, but thats like saying, Oh, I havent been RAPED, so RAPE must not exist. She added, Daz didnt physically assault me. But shouting the word rape in my face is absolutely verbal sexual assault. She also said, Verbal violence is a form of violence.\nAuthor Carmen Maria Machado tweeted that during one of Dazs book tours, she asked him a question and Daz went off for (sic) me for twenty minutes. She characterized Dazs interaction with her as a blast of misogynist rage and public humiliation.\nDazs response\nDaz said, I take responsibility for my past. That is the reason I made the decision to tell the truth of my rape and its damaging aftermath. This conversation is important and must continue. I am listening to and learning from women's stories in this essential and overdue cultural movement. We must continue to teach all men about consent and boundaries.\"\nTwitter responses to the allegations\nOf the first 40 tweets that resulted from a search on Twitter on Saturday of Junot Daz, six of them contain the words misogyny or misogynist. At least 37 out of 40 tweets could be characterized as negative or critical towards Daz. One of the tweets that could be considered neutral was from a media outlet saying that Daz had resigned as Pulitzer board chairman, and that Pulitzer had started an investigation. Some of the tweets that could be considered negative included:\nBleggs. @_Bleggy_ 2:28 AM - 4 May 2018: I wish the Junot Daz thing surprised me. I really do.\nabolish ice.  @okaywowstop 3:22 AM - 4 May 2018: idk i'm pretty pissed about junot Daz but it feels weird how all of these revelations are met with people being like [D@MNIT] NOW I HAVE TO HATE THIS GUY instead of WOW THAT'S [F@%KED] UP AND I FEEL FOR HIS VICTIMS \nIntersectional Papi @JulianThePoet 12:18 PM - 4 May 2018: I believe the women speaking their truth about Junot Daz this morning. Period. I ask that alongside that we move against any rhetoric that aims to undermine the credibility and experiences of male survivors of sexual violence. Period. I have faith we can do both.\nKat Rosenfield @katrosenfield 8:10 AM - 6 May 2018: normal brain: hold Junot Daz accountable for mistreating women. galaxy brain: hold Daz accountable for how his fictional characters treat women. cosmic brain: hold random men accountable for how Dazs fictional characters treat women\nOne person also tweeted her personal experiences of Daz, which she indicated were positive:\nSharline Chiang @SharlineChiang Replying to @zinziclemmons 10:13 PM - 7 May 2018: This is my truth: Junot Daz has helped me become not just a better writer, but far more importantly, a better person, friend and mother in the 14 years that I have known him. He has helped me immensely. I owe him a lot. He has never hurt me. Again, this is my truth.\nNote: the time stamps for the above tweets are for Eastern Daylight Time, which is 14 hours behind the time in Australia, where Clemmons made her comment to Daz.\nSources: AP, BBC, Buzzfeed, Pulitzer, Vox",

Some of the female athletes have said Nassar abused them while they were being treated at the Karolyi Ranch.\nNassar did not have a Texas medical license while treating athletes at the ranch, according to The Dallas Morning News.\nThe Karolyi Ranch is owned by former national team coordinators Bela and Martha Karolyi. A 2016 California lawsuit alleged that the Karolyi couple had knowledge of abuses at the facility but did not stop them. USA Gymnastics ended its collaboration with the ranch on Jan. 18 after Olympic gymnastics champion Simone Biles said Nassar abused her at the ranch.\nThe Walker County Sheriffs Office announced last week that it was investigating what happened at the Karolyi Ranch.

The lab used the same technique that was used to produce a cloned sheep named Dolly over 20 years ago. The monkeys, named Zhong Zhong and Hua Hua, were the first primates cloned by this technique, according to Kevin Sinclair, a developmental biologist who was not involved in the experiment. Scientists said cloned monkeys could aid in disease research.\nCatherine VandeVoort, a scientist from the California National Primate Research Center, said primates that are genetically the same could help researchers isolate effects resulting from behavioral or drug treatments. Qiang Sun of the Chinese Academy of Sciences Institute of Neuroscience said cloned monkeys would be useful for studying genetic illnesses such as some cancers, metabolic and immune disorders.\nThe technique used to clone the long-tailed macaque monkeys is called somatic cell nuclear transfer. The method involves taking a cell nucleus  where a monkeys genetic material is stored  from a primate scientists want to clone, and inserting it into a donated egg. After treating the egg with chemicals, it is then implanted into a surrogate monkey. The technique resulted in two successful births out of 79 attempts, when tissue from monkey fetuses were used.\nThe Chinese scientists who performed the cloning said they followed U.S. National Institutes of Health guidelines for animal research during their studies. A member of the cloning team said, There is no intention for us to apply this method to humans.\nSources: BBC, The Washington Post",

In his opening statement to the committee, Strzok said under oath, not once in my 26 years of defending my nation did my personal opinions impact any official action I took.\nIn 2016, Strzok, using his official FBI phone, sent multiple text messages critical of then-candidate Donald Trump to another FBI employee, Lisa Page, with whom he was romantically involved. Page has since resigned from the FBI, and the bureau reassigned Strzok off the Mueller investigation and into the human resources department. \nMore than 70 members of the House Judiciary and Oversight Committees were present at Strzoks public hearing on Thursday. The hearing was on Oversight of FBI and DOJ Actions Surrounding the 2016 Election: Testimony by FBI Deputy Assistant Director Peter Strzok. Last month, the committees interviewed Strzok in classified sessions for more than 11 hours.\nOIG report that included Strzoks text messages\nLast month, the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) of the Justice Department (DOJ) released a report that reviewed various actions by the FBI and the DOJ ahead of the 2016 presidential election. The report included a text from Page to Strzok in August 2016, in which she said: [Trumps] not ever going to become president, right? Right?! Strzok replied, No. No he wont. Well stop it. The report said the OIG was referring information on text messages sent by five employees, including Strzok, to the FBI to consider whether they violated the agencys Offense Code of Conduct.\nThe OIG said the text messages potentially indicated or created the appearance that investigative decisions were impacted by bias or improper considerations. It also said, Our review did not find documentary or testimonial evidence directly connecting the political views these employees expressed in their text messages and instant messages to the specific investigative decisions we reviewed.\nBased on the text messages, the report said the OIG did not have confidence that one of Strzoks decisions to prioritize the Russia investigation over the Clinton email investigation was free from bias. Strzoks lawyer said, all facts contained in the report lead to the conclusion that the delay [in the Clinton email investigation] was caused by a variety of factors and miscommunications that had nothing to do with Strzoks political views.\nStrzoks opening statement\nIn his opening statement to the committees, Strzok mentioned his text messages and said, I criticized various countries and politicians, including Secretary Clinton, Senator Sanders, then-candidate Trump and others. He also said, Like many people, I had and expressed personal political opinions during an extraordinary Presidential election. Many contained expressions of concern for the security of our country  opinions that were not always expressed in terms I am proud of.\nRegarding his potential bias, Strzok said there is one extraordinarily important piece of evidence supporting my integrity, the integrity of the FBI, and our lack of bias. He continued, In the summer of 2016, I was one of a handful of people who knew the details of Russian election interference and its possible connections with members of the Trump campaign. This information had the potential to derail, and quite possibly, defeat Mr. Trump. But the thought of exposing that information never crossed my mind.\nIn his opening statement, Strzok also said, I am happy to answer any questions for which I have authorization to answer and where the FBI has directed me not to answer, I will abide by the FBIs instructions.\nRepresentatives comments during the hearing\nChairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) began with a question about how many witnesses Strzok interviewed prior to his August 2016 well stop text message. Strzok said the FBIs legal counsel had directed him not to answer questions about an ongoing investigation. \nHouse Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) said, Mr. Strzok, you are under subpoena and are required to answer the question. Strzok later asked if he could consult with FBI counsel. Goodlatte said he could only consult with his own attorney, not the FBIs. Other committee members made comments, and Goodlatte told Strzok, Either comply with the committees directive or refuse to do so, the latter of which will place you at risk of a contempt citation and potential criminal liability. \nWhen the hearing reconvened after a lunch recess, Strzok said FBI counsel told him he could answer the question, and in providing it, he said, I dont recall. Id have to check the case file.\nDuring the hearing, Gowdy said, Agent Strzok had Hillary Clinton winning the White House before he finished investigating her. Agent Strzok had Donald Trump impeached before he even started investigating him. That is bias. Agent Strzok may not see it but the rest of the country does, and it is not what we want, expect or deserve from any law enforcement officer much less the FBI.\nGowdy also said, \"The moment Special Counsel Bob Mueller found out about Peter Strzok's text and emails he kicked him off of the investigation. But that was a year and a half too late. The text and emails may have been discovered in May of 2017, but the bias existed and was manifest a year and a half before that. All the way back to late 2015 and early 2016. So it wasn't the discovery of texts that got him fired, it was the bias manifest in those texts that made him unfit to objectively and dispassionately investigate.\nStrzok said, \"I am stating to you it is not my understanding that [Mueller] kicked me off because of any bias, that it was done based on the appearance.\nThere were also some interruptions and shouting by lawmakers during other representatives comments at the hearing.\nPage was subpoenaed to appear before the same committees in a closed-door session on Wednesday. Her lawyers said she would not testify that day, as she needed more time to prepare. She later agreed to testify in a closed session on Friday.\nSources: AP, CNN, Fox News, The Daily Caller, The New York Times",

      "Content": "President Donald Trump spoke about his plan to reduce opioid abuse in the U.S. at an event in New Hampshire on Monday. Trump said he would: hold pharmaceutical companies accountable for illicit activity and overprescribing; increase access to treatment for drug abuse; sponsor advertisements against drug abuse; ensure first responders have access to lifesaving overdose-reversing drugs; and introduce tough penalties for drug dealers, including capital punishment. \n\nTrump said the U.S. would cut nationwide opioid prescriptions by one-third over three years.\nDuring his speech, Trump said the U.S. would provide federal funding for the development of non-addictive pain reducers, aimed to prevent Americans from becoming addicted in the first place. He also thanked particular pharmaceutical companies for donating overdose-reversing drugs to schools and first responders.\nThe president also called for a reduction in federal funding for sanctuary cities, arguing these jurisdictions release drug dealers into communities. He mentioned one sanctuary city that reportedly is a primary source of fentanyl for another area; he did not cite evidence to support the claim that sanctuary cities increase drug rates. Trump said his planned U.S.-Mexico border wall would reduce the influx of illegal drugs. The Washington Post reported that some experts do not agree that a wall would reduce drugs coming into the U.S.\nTrump spoke at Manchester Community College in New Hampshire. New Hampshire is among the three states with the highest rates of drug overdose deaths, according to The New York Times.\nThe president said his comments were based on 56 recommendations from an opioid commission that he appointed last year. Last month, Congress passed a two-year budget that included a $6 billion funding increase for efforts to address opioid abuse. \nTrumps administration has called for Congress to reduce the minimum amount of drugs that a dealer must have been convicted of selling for mandatory minimum sentences to be imposed. His administration has also proposed a national database to monitor prescription drugs. States have their own systems, and some now share data.\nWhite House counselor Kellyanne Conway said Trump wants to use existing laws to implement death penalties for very specific high-level cases of drug dealers. Trump previously mentioned the possibility of the death penalty for drug trafficking during a Pennsylvania campaign rally for Republican congressional candidate Rick Saccone, who, according to preliminary results, lost to Democrat Conor Lamb last week.\nIn the U.S., the death penalty can legally be implemented in cases in which adult defendants have been convicted of trafficking sufficiently large quantities of drugs (twice the amounts listed here), or if they have at least a $20 million per year enterprise in illegal drugs. A senior counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice, Ames Grawert, said there has never been an execution under the one part of United States law that allows the death penalty as a punishment for traffickers.\nSources: White House, NBC News, The New York Times, The Washington Post",

      "Content": "On Tuesday, Israel said it shot down a Syrian fighter jet that had crossed into Israeli-occupied Golan Heights airspace, while Syria said it was over Syrian territory. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said Israel first tried to warn the plane to return to Syrian airspace and then fired two Patriot interceptor missiles at the Russian-made Syrian Sukhoi jet, which it said was 1.2 miles (2 km) into Israeli territory. Syria said the plane was conducting strikes against rebels in Syrian territory. \nA 1974 Separation of Forces agreement after the Yom Kippur War between Israel and neighboring Arab states established a ceasefire. It established an area between Syria and the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, along Israels northeastern border, that would be monitored by a United Nations force to ensure that the terms of the ceasefire agreement were upheld.\nThe U.N. said its peacekeepers observed burning debris falling from an aircraft about  6 miles (10 km) inside Syrian territory. The pilot of the plane was killed, according to a non-Syrian source close to the Syrian government that was cited by Reuters. The source said the plane fell in an area controlled by the Islamic State (IS). \nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the Syrian airplane flying in Israel-controlled airspace had been a gross violation of the separation of forces between Israel and Syria. He said Israel took appropriate action.\nIsraeli military spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Jonathan Conricus said due to fighting in Syria close to the Golan Heights border, We issued warnings and messages through different channels in various languages numerous times over the day in order to avoid any miscalculations, misunderstandings or any violations of Israeli air space.\nNickolay Mladenov, a U.N. envoy for the Middle East, said Tuesday there was a disturbing trajectory of increasingly frequent and dangerous confrontations between Israel and Syria. He said, I call on all parties to abide by all the provisions of the 1974 agreement.\nIDF spokesman Brig. Gen. Ronen Manelis said, The IDF is ready and vigilant and will continue to act against violations of the 1974 separation of forces agreements.\"\nA Syrian military source cited by state-run news agency SANA called the Israeli action an aggression, and said that by shooting down a Syrian plane that was bombing a terrorist group, Israel helped the terrorists. \nOther Israeli-Syrian border incidents\nThe only other time since 1985 that Israel has shot down a Russian-made Syrian jet was in 2014, when it shot down a Sukhoi-24 over the Golan Heights, using the same missile battery as on Tuesday. In 2014, the plane was about half a mile (800 meters) inside Israeli airspace, according to Israeli news outlet Haaretz, and Israel reportedly decided within 80 seconds to intercept it. The aircraft was hit while traveling back towards Syria and its pilots ejected and landed in Syrian territory, Haaretz reported.\nIn February of this year, Syrian anti-aircraft fire downed an Israeli F-16 jet returning from bombing what Israel said was an Iranian military target in Syria, according to Reuters. Both pilots ejected before the plane crashed in northern Israel.\nOn Monday, Israel used its Davids Sling missile-defense system for the first time against two Syrian surface-to-surface missiles that were calculated to be likely to land in Israeli-controlled territory. Israel ordered the self-destruction of one of the interceptor missiles in flight after it determined the Syrian missile would fall in Syrian territory. The second interceptor missile missed its target and fell in Syrian territory, Haaretz reported.\nSyria began an offensive against rebels in the southwest of its country in June. The Syrian army has 201 fighter aircraft, 134 attack aircraft, and 154,000 active soldiers, according to GlobalFirepower. \nSources: Haaretz, Reuters, SANA",

      "Content": "On Thursday, an Argentine judge issued a warrant for the arrest of former Argentine president and current senator Cristina Fernndez de Kirchner, accusing her of treason. Judge Claudio Bonadios ruling accuses Fernndez of covering up Irans alleged role in a 1994 bombing of a Jewish center in Buenos Aires that killed 85 and injured over two hundred. Fernndez denies the allegations. As a current senator, she has immunity from criminal charges. Bonadio called for the Senate to waive her immunity to allow her to be arrested and tried. \nFernndez was president from 2007 to 2015, and she has been a member of the Senate since Nov. 29 of this year. She is accused of attempting to negotiate a trade deal with Iran in exchange for hiding Iranian officials participation in the attack on the AMIA Jewish center. \nThe accusation is based on an investigation led by prosecutor Alberto Nisman in 2015, which included the use of phone taps. Nisman died of a gunshot wound in January 2015. At the time of his death, he had reported his findings in court and he was scheduled to report to congress on his investigation. The death was ruled a suicide; one official said the evidence is consistent with murder.\nThe Senate is currently on recess until March, but could be called back for certain matters. A two-thirds vote would be needed to rescind Fernndezs immunity from prosecution. On Oct. 25, congress voted to remove immunity for Julio De Vido, Fernndez de Kirchners former planning minister, and he was arrested that day on charges of fraud and corruption. He denies the charges.\nAcharge of treason holds a sentence of 10 to 25 years in prison, Reuters reported. In separate cases, Fernndez de Kirchner is being investigated for corruption, which she denies. \nAlso on Thursday, police arrested at least four people for their roles in the alleged cover-up of the 1994 bombing. These people included Carlos Zannini, Fernndezs former legal secretary; Luis DElia, whom The Guardian described as a social activist; and Jorge Alejandro Khalil, a Muslim cleric. Hector Timerman, a former foreign minister was placed under house arrest.\nSources: Reuters, The Guardian",

Authorities transported the boys and their coach to the same hospital as the eight other boys who were rescued on Sunday and Monday. \n\"All 12 Wild Boars and coach have been extracted from the cave, confirmed the Thai Navy SEALs Facebook page. All are safe.\nTuesdays rescue operation involved 19 divers entering the cave at 10 a.m. local time, and took about nine hours total. The last group to come out of the cave was comprised of four Navy SEALs, including a doctor who had stayed with the team for a week in the cave after British divers discovered the team on July 2. The ongoing rescue operations have involved a total of 90 divers, 40 from Thailand and 50 international. \nJedsada Chokedamrongsook, the permanent secretary of the Thai Health Ministry, said the first group of four boys taken out of the cave on Sunday were 14 to 16 years old, and the second group of boys, taken out on Monday, were 12 to 14 years old. Medical officials said on Tuesday the eight boys who were rescued on those days did not have fevers and \"seem to be in high spirits.\"\nChokedamrongsook said the families of the first four rescued boys had been able to see their children through a window and talk to them on the phone. If tests show the boys to be free of infection, the families will be allowed to enter the room with them. The hospital has sent samples to Bangkok for testing. Histoplasmosis is one possible infection they could be testing for since it can develop from breathing fungal spores from bird and bat droppings, according to the Mayo Clinic. The boys may stay in the hospital for seven days due to their weakened immune systems, CNN reported.\nThe boys traveled more than half a mile underwater during the trip out of the cave, according to NBC News. During the diving sections, the boys wore full face masks and wet suits, and two experienced divers accompanied them and carried their air tanks. \nBefore the final rescue operation, Narongsuk Keasub, a diver for the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand who delivered air tanks into the caves, said, every step of the extraction is risky, noting the conditions of the cave. We can only see our hands [at a] short distance, he said. Secondly, the stones are razor sharp which is dangerous for our diving, [and] thirdly the passage is very narrow.\nSources: BBC, CNN, NBC News",

      "Content": "On Friday, Denver police said they arrested Uber driver Michael Andre Hancock, 29, in connection with the fatal shooting of his passenger, Hyun Kim, 45. A police statement said, There is probable cause to believe that Michael Hancock discharged [a semi-automatic handgun], striking [Kim] numerous times causing his death. At about 2:47 a.m. local time Friday, a male witness at the scene on an on-ramp to I-25 called 911 saying Hancock told him his passenger tried to attack him and he shot the rider.\nDenver police issued a statement of probable cause describing the incident. The statement was partially redacted and did not show the victims name. It said the male witness who called 911 handed the phone to Hancock, who then identified himself to the dispatcher.\nPolice arrived at the scene and found Hancocks sedan crashed into a concrete barrier, almost perpendicular to the direction of traffic. Police found Kim on the floorboard of the front passenger seat of the car, with apparent gunshot wounds, and began lifesaving procedures until paramedics arrived. Kim was pronounced dead at the hospital.\nPolice handcuffed Hancock and removed a Ruger semi-automatic handgun from his waistband. According to the police statement, Hancock began to have trouble breathing and was taken to DHMC hospital, where he was treated and then released.\nInvestigators found 10 spent .40-caliber shell casings on the left shoulder of the road, suspected bullet strikes in the passenger compartment of the car and blood on the pavement, according to the statement. I-25 southbound lanes were closed from about 3 a.m. until about 8 a.m. local time while police investigated.\nHancock declined to issue a statement about the incident without an attorney, the statement said.\nHancock does not have a criminal record in Colorado, according to court records. He has had traffic tickets. Uber, a ride-hailing company, said Hancock had been a driver with them for about three years.\nHancocks parents said their son had a permit to carry a concealed handgun from when he worked as a security guard. Marika Putnam, a Denver police spokeswoman, said she did not know if the existence of such a permit had been confirmed. Colorado allows gun owners to carry firearms in their vehicles without a permit, according to The Washington Post.\nUber company policy says drivers and riders are not allowed to carry firearms while using its app, and if they are found doing so, they may lose access to Uber. Some states do not allow employers to prohibit firearm possession. Uber said its policy on firearms should apply in Colorado.\nFollowing the incident, Uber issued a statement saying, \"We are deeply troubled by the events in Denver today. Our thoughts are with the families of those involved. The driver's access to the app has been removed, and we will continue working closely with police.\" Uber also said the incident appeared to have occurred during an on-app trip.\nSources: AP, CNN, The Washington Post, USA Today",

      "Content": "On Thursday, Denmarks parliament passed a law that prohibits face coverings in public starting Aug. 1, except when there is a recognizable purpose, such as for cold weather or motorcycle helmets. Under the law, police can order women to remove face coverings such as veils, burqas or niqabs, order them to leave public places, and impose fines of 1,000 Danish crowns ($160) for a first offense, and up to 10,000 crowns plus up to six months in jail for repeat offenses.\nThe Danish parliament voted 75-30 for the law, with 74 absentees.\nSren Pape Poulsen, the conservative party leader in the governing coalition, said face coverings in public are incompatible with the values of Danish society or respect for the community. Amnesty International called the banning of face coverings in public a discriminatory violation of womens rights ... All women should be free to dress as they please and to wear clothing that expresses their identity or beliefs.\nA burqa is a garment that covers the face and body, and has a mesh over the eye area. A niqab is a head and face covering with an opening for the eyes. Hijabs, head and neck coverings that leave the face exposed, would be legal under the law.\nOther areas of Europe with legal restrictions on face coverings in public include Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, France, the Netherlands and the state of Bavaria in Germany.\nSources: BBC, Reuters, The Guardian",

      "Content": "On Wednesday, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani announced a ceasefire by government forces with the Taliban until June 20. The date coincides with the end of the Ramadan fasting month, the Islamic holiday of Eid al-Fitr. Ghani said government military operations against other groups such as the Islamic State (IS) would continue during the ceasefire. The Taliban did not immediately respond to the governments announcement. U.S. forces in the country said they would honor the ceasefire. CNN reported the ceasefire would begin the middle of next week.\nGhani said government forces \"will only stop offensive maneuvers against Afghan armed Taliban and will continue to target [IS] and other foreign-backed terrorist organizations and their affiliates.\" He added, \"This ceasefire is an opportunity for Taliban to introspect that their violent campaign is not winning them hearts and minds, but further alienating the Afghan people from their cause.\nIn February, Ghani called for peace talks with the Taliban without preconditions, and said he was willing to recognize the Taliban as a political group if it recognized the Afghan government and respected Afghan laws. \nThis week a council of religious clerics convened and issued a statement saying it called on the Taliban to respond positively to the peace offer of the Afghan government in order to prevent further bloodshed in the country.\nU.S.-led forces removed the Taliban from power in Afghanistan in 2001, following the 9/11 attacks. Other countries have decreased their troop levels in Afghanistan from about 140,000 in 2014 to about 15,600, Reuters reported. Last year, more than 10,000 Afghan civilians were killed or wounded in conflicts between government forces and the Taliban. \nIn January, BBC reported the Taliban is openly active in 70 percent of Afghanistan. U.S. military information indicated that in October 2017, 14 percent of Afghan districts were under the control or influence of the Taliban or other militant groups, according to CNN.\nSources: Al Jazeera, BBC, CNN 1, CNN 2, Reuters",

In a press conference, Trump said the decision, which he originally announced in December, was much appreciated in Israel and elsewhere. Netanyahu thanked Trump for the the decision on behalf of the people of Israel and said the American-Israeli alliance had never been stronger. \nTrump said construction of the embassy was already underway, that it would be built quickly and would cost about $250,000. Last month, State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert said that the new facility would open by the end of next year, and that this spring the U.S. ambassador and a small staff would begin working at the temporary facility. When asked if Trump would go to Jerusalem for the opening of the new embassy, he said he may.\nNetanyahu told reporters the leaders would be discussing Irans aggressions and nuclear ambitions, and the Iran nuclear deal. He said, Iran must be stopped, calling it their common challenge. \nNetanyahu also said they would discuss peace negotiations for the Middle East. Trump said that peace between Israel and the Palestinians would be a great thing for the world, the country and everybody, and they were working very hard on it.\nThis is the fifth time Trump and Netanyahu have met since Trump took office in 2017.

      "Content": "Hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, earthquakes and fires can all be deadly, destructive, and costly. In the United States, they also can qualify for federal assistance, if designated a major disaster by the U.S. president.\nThere are a number of federal, state and local agencies, as well as non-governmental organizations, that respond to such natural disasters. This can include efforts to:\n\n\tRespond to the immediate effects of a disaster with steps to limit loss of life and property damage, including providing emergency shelter and food supplies.\n\tHelp communities recover to normal or better conditions with short- and long-term projects, including restoring power and telecommunications, removing debris and repairing damaged properties.\n\tMitigate the effects of future disasters by implementing flood control projects, building tornado safe rooms, improving building quality standards, and other efforts.\n\tIncrease preparedness for disasters, through ongoing planning and training of responders, public awareness campaigns about how to respond in disaster situations, and implementation of warning systems.\n\nDisaster relief poses many challenges, from finding sufficient funding to coordinating interagency communications and relief efforts. \nWhat does a major disaster or emergency designation do? \nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), which is part of the Department of Homeland Security, is responsible for providing federal aid to federal emergency or federal disaster areas. Other federal agencies also help with and contribute to disaster relief and mitigation.\nFor a state government to access the majority of federal funding thats available for natural disaster relief, the event needs to be declared a national emergency or national major disaster by the president.\nHow does an event become a national disaster or emergency?\nThe Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, which was signed into law in 1988 and has since been amended, outlines the process for declaring a major disaster. The act says, All requests for a declaration by the President that a major disaster exists shall be made by the Governor of the affected State. The District of Columbia as well as U.S. territories, such as Puerto Rico, also count as states under this law.\nThe general process for getting the president to declare a major disaster is as follows, according to the Congressional Research Services interpretations of the relevant laws:\n\n\tThe event occurs.\n\tLocal governments respond to the event, and if unable to sufficiently respond to it, they request assistance from the state.\n\tLocal, state and federal agencies, as well as volunteer organizations, complete initial assessments about the cost of response and recovery.\n\tThe states governor sends a request to the president for federal aid.\n\tFEMA reviews the requests and makes a recommendation to the president.\n\tThe president either approves or denies the request. If the president declares a major disaster or emergency, FEMA disaster relief funding is allocated and distributed.\n\nIn cases in which a natural disaster is predicted to be especially destructive, the states can request an emergency declaration prior to the actual occurrence of the event, in according with the Stafford Act.\nHow costly are natural disasters?\nNatural disasters can be quite costly in terms of both the loss of human life and the economic costs of repairs and replacement of damaged property.\nThe ability to compare human casualties across disasters can be limited due to discrepancies in the counting of direct and indirect casualties in the death tolls. Direct casualties refer to those killed as an immediate and direct result of the event. Some agencies only count direct deaths, such as from drowning or being crushed by debris. Some governments or other reports also include indirect deaths linked to the disaster.\nIn the case of Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico last year, one study ordered by the territorys government also counted deaths attributed to extended periods of blackouts and peoples inability to access hospitals or medical supplies. Including indirect deaths, the study estimated that 2,975 people were killed in Puerto Rico as a result of the hurricane, which would make it the deadliest natural disaster in the U.S. in decades. In comparison, Hurricane Katrina, which primarily affected Louisiana and Mississippi in 2005, is estimated to have caused 1,833 direct and indirect deaths.\nFinancial estimates of natural disasters also vary depending on the methodology of data-collection. Based on estimates from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Hurricane Katrina caused $161 billion worth of damage, making it the most expensive disaster in recent U.S. history. Hurricane Harvey, which made landfall in Texas in 2017, was the second most destructive at an estimated $125 billion worth of damage, NOAA reported. \nHow are repairs funded?\nDamage to public property\nFEMA: FEMAs public assistance program, which is its largest in terms of funding, covers costs associated with redressing damage to public infrastructure, from removing debris on roads to repairing public buildings, according to the Congressional Research Service.\nAccording to figures from the Government Accountability Office, FEMA spent $104.5 billion on its Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) obligations between 2005 and 2014, including repairs to public infrastructure as well as aid to private citizens. Thats an average of more than $10 billion per year. (More on FEMAs funding below.)\nOther federal agencies: Seventeen federal departments all contribute to disaster relief, such as the departments of defense, transportation, agriculture, interior, and housing and urban development. These agencies spent an inflation-adjusted average of $25.5 billion a year on disaster assistance from 2005 to 2014, according to the Pew Charitable Trusts, an independent non-profit organization.\nLocal and state funding: In addition to requests for federal funds, local and state budgets can include disaster relief funding through various agencies and line-items. According to a Pew Charitable Trusts report, the data on state funds for disaster relief is limited, varies by state and isnt comprehensively tracked by each state. Some of the state spending was also focused on mitigation and preventative measures.\nDamage to private property\nFEMA: People living in disaster-designated areas who sustained damage to their homes, vehicles or personal property can be eligible for grant money from FEMA. According to the agency, the grants can help pay for temporary housing, emergency home repairs, uninsured and underinsured personal property losses and medical, dental and funeral expenses caused by the disaster, along with other serious disaster-related expenses. To determine whether people qualify, FEMA inspectors inspect the damage, and some grants are available only for lower income individuals. (To make a claim, go to www.DisasterAssistance.gov.)\nPrivate insurance: Private insurance for real estate and personal property can cover expenses related to repairing and replacing damaged property. For example, private insurance companies paid out an estimated $41.1 billion on 1.7 million unique claims related to Hurricane Katrina.\nNGOs and private donations: Non-governmental agencies, such as charitable organizations, as well as private donors sometimes aid in disaster relief. The American Red Cross, for instance, led a relief effort after Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans. In the weeks that followed the 2005 hurricane, the organization set up 1,150 shelters that housed almost half a million people, deployed 177,600 relief workers, and spent $854 million in emergency assistance.\nHow is FEMA funded?\nCongress funds FEMA in two main ways: standard funding and supplemental funding. For the former, Congress provides base funding for FEMAs normal operations, which in fiscal year 2017 was $615 million. Congress also proactively provides FEMA funding for Major Declarations, which was $6.7 billion that year. This figure is based on disaster relief expenses over the past decade.\nCongress may be asked to grant supplemental funding to FEMA for disasters. For example, in 2005, when Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma occurred, Congress provided an addition $43 billion to FEMA.\nIn October 2017, Congress passed a $36.5 billion dollar hurricane and wildfire relief bill, which directed $18.7 billion to the Federal Emergency Management Agencys (FEMA) disaster relief fund to address Hurricane Maria, Hurricane Harvey, Hurricane Irma and more.\nAccording to a Congressional Research Services (CRS) report, not all members of Congress agree on the efficacy of FEMAs current method of funding. Some believe that the current method works well, CRS reported, while others argue that changes need to be made to either increase the amount of available funding or to change funding structures to reduce the need for supplemental payments from Congress. For example, some have suggested creating a larger contingency fund for FEMA to use at its discretion. Others have suggested Congress should make the requirements to declare a national disaster stricter.\n\nSources: AP, CNN, CRS  FEMA Funding, C-SPAN- Relief Bill, Data Center, DHS Budgets, FEMA FAQs, GAO  Federal Disaster Relief, NOAA, NPR, Pew Trust, Politifact, Stafford Act",

      "Content": "A pedestrian bridge collapsed in Florida on Thursday, killing at least six people, Miami-Dade police spokesman Alvaro Zabaleta said. At least nine people have been taken to the hospital. The bridge from the Florida International University (FIU) campus to the city of Sweetwater, near Miami, fell onto at least eight cars stopped at a red light on the road below it. The bridge had been under construction and was not open to pedestrians. Florida Governor Rick Scott said he would meet with local officials in the evening to discuss the situation.\nMunilla Construction Management (MCM), the company that was building the bridge, tweeted that its thoughts and prayers go out to everyone affected by this terrible tragedy. It added that it will conduct a full investigation to determine what happened and will cooperate with investigators on scene in every way.\nA previous tweet by MCM indicated that the section of the bridge had been moved into place on Saturday. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) visited the site on Thursday and later tweeted that workers were tightening suspension cables when the bridge collapsed.\nThe unfinished bridge was 174 feet (53 m) long and 950 tons (862 metric tons), according to CBS News, and was to be 289 feet long when completed in the first half of 2019. The project was estimated to cost $14.2 million. It was made using an accelerated bridge construction (ABC) method that involved building the 174 foot section on the side of the road and then moving the entire section into place over the road, minimizing the time the road had to be closed during construction.\nThe bridge was designed by FIGG Bridge Engineers. FIGG said it was stunned by the collapse, saying that nothing like this has ever happened before in its 40-year history. It said its team mourns the loss of life and injuries and its prayers go out to all involved.\nFIU students are currently on spring break. \nSources: CBS News, CNN, Miami Herald",

      "Content": "Federal prosecutors on Wednesday indicted New York Rep. Chris Collins (R) and his son Cameron for allegedly participating in a scheme to commit insider trading. The indictment also charged Stephen Zarsky, the father of Cameron Collins fiancee. The three men are each charged with conspiracy, securities fraud, wire fraud, and making false statements to the FBI. Rep. Collins has denied the charges.\nThe defendants are accused of illegally selling securities of an Australian biotechnology company called Innate Immunotherapeutics. Rep. Collins sits on the companys board of directors. According to the indictment, after Collins learned that a clinical drug trial for secondary progressive multiple sclerosis, an autoimmune disease that affects the nervous system, was unsuccessful, he contacted his son and revealed the confidential information. \nAccording to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, insider trading is a crime when someone involved in the company buys or sells stock, or facilitates the buying and selling of company stock, based on nonpublic information. In this case, Rep. Collins is accused of sharing non-public information that influenced his son and other associates to sell stock before market prices could decline. \nThe allegations\nThe indictment said Collins attempted to contact his son 15 seconds after learning about the trial results on June 22. After several missed calls, Collins had a six minute conversation with his son. The next day, his son began selling company shares. Between the opening of the market on Friday, June 23 and the close of the market on Monday, June 26, Cameron Collins sold about 1.4 million Innate shares before the trial failure became public. \nCameron Collins allegedly drove to his fiancees parents house on June 22, and, within minutes of their arrival, his fiancees mother took steps to sell her Innate [Immunotherapeutics] shares, the indictment said. The next day, Collins fiancee spoke with her father. The indictment claimed Zarsky placed an order to sell all of his shares in the company about five minutes after speaking with his daughter.\nThe Department of Justice (DOJ) alleged that Rep. Collins betrayed his duties of trust and confidence to Innate Immunotherapeutics by providing inside information to his son about the trial results so that his son and Zarsky could trade their shares before the results were made public.\nThe DOJ said Collins actions prevented him and his associates from losing about $768,000. (The DOJs estimate was based on the company stock shares after it publicly announced the trial results. Innate Immunotherapeutics announced the trial results the evening of June 26. The next trading day, the companys shares dropped to $0.0351 from the previous days close of $0.45, according to the indictment.)\nThe DOJ also alleged that Rep. Collins, Cameron Collins and Zarsky made false statements to the FBI to cover up their participation in the insider trading scheme.\nCollins response\nRep. Collins called the charges against him false and meritless during a press conference on Wednesday, adding that he would mount a vigorous defense in court to clear his name. I believe that I acted properly and within the law at all times with regard to my affiliation with Innate, Collins said. Throughout my tenure in Congress, I have followed all rules and all ethical guidelines when it comes to my personal investments, including those with Innate. \nWhen it became clear that the drug I and others believed in fell short of our hopes and expectations, I held on to my shares rather than sell them, Collins added. As a result, the significant investment I made in the company worth millions of dollars were wiped out. Thats ok. Thats the risk I took.\nRep. Collins is up for reelection in November for New Yorks 27th Congressional District. He was first elected to represent the district in 2013. Collins said he plans to remain on the ballot for the 2018 election.",

      "Content": "What is South Africas land reform plan?\nSouth Africa is pursuing a change to its constitution to allow the country to essentially take farmland owned by some white citizens and reallocate it to black citizens, without compensation. South Africas current constitution would not allow this specifically, but in February 2018, parliament voted 241 to 83 in favor of pursuing such an amendment, and directed a government committee to review the constitution and respond to the government by the end of August. \nThe proposed land reform or land expropriation would be intended to address inequality in land ownership between minority whites and majority blacks. Currently, about 9 percent of the population of South Africa is white, while about 72 percent of the farmland is owned by whites, according to government totals. This trend resulted largely from historical legal and economic inequality between the races. For instance, the 1913 Native Land Act had granted the majority of the fertile farmland to white people, expelling native Africans from the land. (More on this below.) \nThe government has not announced all of the details of how the land expropriation would be achieved. Earlier this year, the government released a draft list of farms that could be expropriated. President Cyril Ramaphosa has said it would be handled with care and responsibility and not be a smash and grab job.\nWhat is the historical context of South African land ownership?\nLets look at history. In 1651, Dutch settlers set up a permanent colony in the southern tip of South Africa, following more than a century and a half of sporadic contact between Europeans and local people. This began an era of colonization, European expansion, warring between aboriginal people and Europeans, and slavery (initially with the importing of slaves from elsewhere). In the late 18th century, of the free population, only around 15 to 20 percent were free blacks.\nThen, the British occupied South Africas cape in 1795 after a war with the French, and, excluding a four year period, ruled the area. Other areas remained settled by Dutch descendents, known as Boers. The British military expanded further into territories controlled by aboriginal groups (including the Xhosa and San peoples) to control more farmland. Slavery also increased during this time until it was officially abolished between 1834 and 1838 in the British territories. Yet new labor laws (including the Masters and Servants Ordinance of 1841) restricted employee rights, such as imposing criminal penalties on employees breaching contracts and leaving their places of work. \nA war between the British and the Boers at the turn of the century eventually lead to a reconstruction period and the creation of the Union of South Africa in 1910. During this time, a series of laws disfavored non-European descended people and promoted racial segregation. For instance, South Africa had a pass system that required non-whites (including black and Indian people) to carry passes with them and restricted their movements. Land ownership was also restricted.\nWhat was the Native Land Act of 1913?\nIn 1913, the Native Land Act was passed, restricting the land that native people could own to selected areas in native reserves. It became illegal for black people to purchase farmland outside of reserves. At the time, Africans comprised more than 67 percent of the population, while the reserves made up only 7.5 percent of the territory (later expanded to 13 percent in 1936). Delegations of South Africans that went to Britain to protest the land act were unsuccessful. \nSol Plaatje, a African who advocated for the end of the act in Britain and later the U.S., wrote after it passed, We knew that this law was harsh as its instigators were callous, and we knew that it would  render many poor people homeless, but  we were scarcely prepared for such a rapid and widespread crash as it caused in the lives of the natives. He cited, for instance, exponential increases in the price of milk and other goods in addition to native people being forced off land. \nThe land ownership restrictions remained in place until the end of Apartheid, the countrys system of racial separateness, in the 1990s. Racial change was announced in parliament in February 1990, Nelson Mandela was freed, and many of the Apartheid-era policies were repealed the following year. South Africa held its first free election in which the black majority was allowed to vote in 1994, Mandela won as the African National Congress (ANC) candidate, and a constitution was drafted that granted land ownership rights to non-white people. \nWhat happened after Apartheid? \nSouth Africas constitution, adopted in 1996, outlined the nations commitment to land reform, and to reforms to bring about equitable access to all South Africas natural resources, and committed the state to take reasonable legislative measures to ensure equitable land access. The constitution said people dispossessed of their land in 1913 would be entitled to restitution of that property or to equitable redress, but did not specifically outline seizure or reappropriation of land from the white minority without their consent. \nSince the end of Apartheid, land has been redistributed through a system of willing white owners selling to willing black buyers. That system has resulted in about 10 percent of white owned land changing to black owners, according to BBC.\nYet given the history of legal and economic inequality, about 72 percent of the farmland remains owned by the white minority. \nWhy do supporters of land reform say?\nMany people in favor of land reform see it as correcting an historical injustice: essentially taking back property that was unjustly taken. \nThe Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) party brought the motion to parliament in February to call for the constitutional amendment. We must ensure that we restore the dignity of our people without compensating the criminals who stole our land, EFF leader Julius Malema said.\nWhat do critics of reform say?\nOpposition to land reform is argued on different grounds, from moral to economic or practical. Some argue, for instance, that seizing land from whites because of their race is a type of continuation of racism in South Africa (in reverse).\nThe official opposition party, the Democratic Alliance, opposed the motion to pursue changing the constitution, arguing that it would damage property rights and could deter international investment. Others have suggested that pursuing the land expropriations could harm the economy through loss of productivity. \nSouth African non-profit group AfriForum, which says it represents minority rights, especially the rights of Afrikaners (Dutch-descended South Africans), has advocated internationally to stop land reform. AfriForum, in part, cites increasing violence against white farmers as a reason to stop the land reform. It argues seizing the land will inspire more violence, similar to what happened in the neighboring country of Zimbabwe when it executed a similar action. \n\nSources: AfriForum, AP, BBC, BBC, Constitution, Encyclopedia Britannica, Fox News, Iris Berger, Reuters, Sol Plaatje, via Williams",

Two days prior, the Kentucky Center for Investigative Reporting (KyCIR) published a report saying a 21-year-old woman alleged that Johnson had molested her in 2013, when she was 17. Johnson denied the allegation that he had groped the woman under her clothes and stuck his tongue in her mouth on New Years morning, 2013.\nOn Wednesday, authorities located Johnson dead outside his car near a bridge in Mount Washington, Kentucky, southeast of Louisville. A handgun was found at the scene. Earlier in the day, Johnson posted a message on Facebook in which he denied the allegation and asked his family to stay strong for his wife. His relatives called police after seeing the post. \nBullitt County Coroner Dave Billings said authorities used Johnsons cell phone to track his location. The Bullitt County Sheriffs Office ruled the death a suicide. \nJohnson was accused of molesting the girl when she stayed overnight with his daughter at an apartment near the church where he was pastor at the time. According to the Kentucky Center for Investigative Reporting (KyCIR), Louisville Metro Police began investigating the allegation in April 2013, and closed the investigation without bringing charges against Johnson. \nKyCIR obtained police documents, interviewed the accuser, and published its results on Monday. The organization said police reopened the investigation on Tuesday, the same day that Johnson held a press conference at his church and denied the allegation.\nSources: CNN, The Washington Post",

      "Content": "On Sunday, Italians will vote in national elections for 630 members of the lower chamber and 315 members of the Senate. A party or coalition that forms a majority government can nominate a prime minister. Sundays vote will be the first under a new electoral system that, according to BBC, encourages parties to form pre-election coalitions. (Keep reading for more about the electoral changes.) \nThe parties running in the election include:\n\n\tthe Forza Italia (FI) party, led by former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, 81\n\tthe Eurosceptic Lega party, (which has formed a coalition with the FI party) led by Matteo Salvini, 44 \n\tthe Democratic Party (PD), led by Former Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, 43\n\tthe Five Star Movement (M5S), led by Luigi Di Maio, 31\n\nBerlusconi cannot be nominated for prime minister due to a criminal conviction for tax fraud. The current Italian president is Sergio Mattarella and the prime minister is Paolo Gentiloni, of Renzis PD party. \nTo vote for members of the lower chamber, Italians must be 18 years old, and to vote for the Senate they must be 25 years old, according to BBC. Polls close on Sunday at 11 p.m. local time. \nItalian unemployment is 11 percent, the highest in the EU, and it has the second largest national debt in the union, following that of Greece. Italy has the third largest economy of the 28-member countries of the EU, not including the U.K., which plans to leave the bloc.\nNew electoral system\nThis is the first election under a law that includes part first-past-the-post and part proportional representation. First-past-the-post (FPTP) refers to election systems that grant a seat to the candidate who receives the most votes in his or her district, similar to systems in the U.S. \nProportional representation (PR) electoral systems grant seats to candidates based on the percentage of total votes that party receives. For example, in a basic PR system, if a party receives 25 percent of the votes, it would get to fill 25 percent of the seats with its preferred candidates,regardless of the local area in which each candidate lives. \nThe new Italian electoral system allots some seats to be filled by FPTP, and some by PR. For instance, in the lower house of parliament, 232 of the 630 seats (about 37 percent) will be filled by FPTP, another 386 (about 61 percent) by PR, and the remaining seats will be voted in by overseas constituencies.\nSources: BBC, CNN, The Local it, The New York Times",

      "Content": "The word meddling is often used in media reports about Special Counsel Robert Muellers Russia investigation. But it can difficult to understand what it refers to, especially given the spin and biases of the media and the officials involved.\nMeddling means to interest oneself in what is not one's concern or to interfere without right or propriety. The word is somewhat imprecise and can be subjective. Used in the context of the Russia investigation, it doesnt specify what actions Russia allegedly took, and many news reports that use the word dont state specific actions either. The breakdown below is aimed at filling in that missing information. \nAlso, the verb to meddle can mean to change or handle something in a way that is unwanted or harmful, which could assume that Russia did indeed change the election in a damaging way. As noted below, this has not been determined. The word interference may be a more objective term to use, although on its own it also doesnt specify what was interfered with or how.\nIn more precise terms, Russian meddling refers to the accusations that have been made against Russians regarding the 2016 election, including computer hacking, a so-called influence campaign and potential coordination with U.S. citizens. \nWhile many of the details of Muellers investigation and the intelligence agencies findings havent been publicly disclosed, here is a brief look at what we know based on investigative hearings, official statements and publicly available intelligence reports. \nNote: Many media outlets have stopped using the word alleged when referring to Russian meddling. This is an important distinction; while some Russian entities have been indicted, they havent been convicted, and Russia has denied the accusations. \nHacking\nHacking typically refers to gaining unauthorized access to a computer or network. On Oct. 7, 2016, the U.S. Intelligence Community released a statement saying it was confident that the Russian government directed the compromises of emails from US persons and institutions, including from US political organizations.\nAccording to a declassified intelligence report released on Jan. 6, 2017, Russian intelligence allegedly hacked Democratic National Committee (DNC) networks in July 2015 and maintained that access until at least June 2016. The report noted that Russia had also obtained some data on Republican-affiliated targets, yet said that information was not used in the same way as the DNC data.\nIn addition to DNC emails, the report said Russia allegedly obtained and maintained access to elements of multiple US state or local electoral boards, and these elements were not related to vote tallying. In June 2017, a classified National Security Agency report obtained by The Intercept claimed that Russian military intelligence executed a cyberattack on at least one U.S. voting software supplier and sent spear-phishing emails to at least 100 local election officials before the 2016 election. \nLater that month, Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Jeanette Manfra testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee that the department received reports that some states had experienced cyber-enabled scanning and probing of election-related infrastructure that appeared to originate from a Russia-based company.\nNote: The intelligence report didnt include the evidence that agencies used to reach its conclusion. \"This document does not include the full supporting information, including specific intelligence on key elements of the influence campaign, it said.\nAlso, the report said that if Russia did interfere, it had not been determined if its alleged actions had an impact on the outcome of the 2016 election. \nInfluence campaign\nThe Jan. 2017 intelligence report concluded that Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 with the intent to influence the U.S. presidential election, and that Russias goals were to undermine public faith in the U.S. democratic process, denigrate Secretary [Hillary] Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency. The report stated that the CIA and FBI had high confidence in these judgments, while the NSA had moderate confidence.\nThe report assessed with high confidence that Russian military intelligence used a persona called Guccifer 2.0 and Wikileaks.com to disseminate data associated with the U.S. 2016 presidential elections, such as email accounts associated with the Democratic National Committee and political figures. The report said Russian diplomats also publicly criticized the US electoral process, calling it unfair. The report didnt name specific diplomats. \nIt also said pro-Kremlin bloggers had created a Twitter campaign called #DemocracyRIP on election night in anticipation of Clintons victory. The report noted that such influence campaigns were multi-faceted and that people carrying them out use various means to hide their identity so that their actions can be deniable.\nThe report also mentioned Russian propagandist Dmitry Kiselev and a pro-Kremlin proxy Vladimir Zhirinovskiy as being part of the alleged influence campaign. During his weekly newsmagazine program, Kiselev reportedly described Trump as a victim of a corrupt political system that wanted to prevent his election because of his desire to work with Moscow. The report claimed that Zhirinovskiy publicly announced that Russia would drink champagne if Trump was elected, because it would mean Russia would be able to advance its positions on Syria and Ukraine. \nU.S. intelligence agencies said the Russian organization Internet Research Agency hired professional commenters to create social media accounts and promote and share stories about Clinton and other political issues. In Nov. 2017, Twitter, Google and Facebook testified before the Senate and House intelligence committees on Russias alleged use of their services. Facebook said it found more than 3,000 IRA-linked ads on its platform. Twitter said it found and removed 2,752 accounts connected to the IRA. Google confirmed that Russian-backed accounts uploaded more than 1,000 videos to its streaming service YouTube.\nMuellers investigation recently indicted 13 Russian nationals and three Russian entities for alleged interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, including the IRA.\nAlleged coordination between Trump campaign and Russia\nOn March 20, 2017, former FBI Director James Comey testified before the House Intelligence Committee that the FBIs Russia investigation at the time included investigating the nature of any links between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and the Russian government and whether there was any coordination between the campaign and Russia's efforts.\nIn May 2017, when Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed Mueller as special counsel to head the Russia investigation, his order directed Mueller to investigate any links and/or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump. \nThe word collusion has often been used in the press in reference to alleged cooperation with Russia. Merriam-Webster defines the word as secret agreement or cooperation especially for an illegal or deceitful purpose. Yet collusion in itself is not a federal crime, with the exception of antitrust law. The Mueller investigation has not said which laws would have been violated if there was indeed coordination between the Russian government and Trump campaign officials. \nOne criminal law that could potentially apply is 52 U.S.C. 30121, which states its illegal for a foreign national to make a contribution or donation of money or other thing of value to a campaign, as well as a crime for a U.S. citizen to solicit, accept, or receive this type of contribution.\nThe investigation could also be looking into 18 USC Sec. 371, which refers to conspiracy by two or more persons to violate a U.S. law or to defraud the United States. Coordinating the purchase of political ads for an election, may also be illegal, as noted in the Context cited above. \nThe Department of Justice and Muellers investigation havent said what specifically prompted the investigation into the Trump campaign. The press has reported several instances in which Trumps campaign allegedly had contact or business dealings with Russian officials. For example:\n\n\tFormer national security adviser Michael Flynn, who has also been indicted by Mueller, resigned in Feb. 2017 after he reportedly discussed lifting sanctions against Russia with the Russian ambassador without approval by Trump or Vice President Mike Pence. Flynn has since pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his Russian contacts.\n\tDuring Attorney General Jeff Sessions confirmation hearing, he had said he did not recall having contact with any Russian officials during the presidential campaign. Media outlets later reported that he had met with the Russian ambassador on two occasions.\n\tAfter the investigation began, Donald Trump Jr. disclosed that he, Jared Kushner and former campaign chairman Paul Manafort had a meeting in June 2016 with a Russian lawyer who promised to provide compromising information on Clinton. (Read more about that meetinghere.)\n\nPutins response\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has denied the various accusations of interference and hacking. He has also said that the Russian companies that were indicted by Muellers team dont represent the Russian government or Russian authorities. When asked whether he would extradite Russian citizens indicted by Mueller, Putin said, never.\nAsked about the indictments in an interview with NBC this month, Putin said, They could just as easily have been the names of some Americans who are sitting here and interfering in your own political process.\nYou mentioned a number of names, some individuals. And youre telling me that theyre Russians. So what?\" Putin said. \"Maybe being Russian, theyre actually working for some kind of American company. Perhaps one of them used to work for one of the candidates. I have no idea.\"\nTrumps response\nTrump and the White House have denied the presidential campaign had any coordination with Russia. On March 17 of this year, Trump tweeted, The Mueller probe should never have been started in that there was no collusion and there was no crime.\nIn February, when Muellers investigation announced the indictments against 13 Russian nationals and three Russian entities, Rosenstein said they did not allege that any American was a knowing participant in illegal activity, or that the actions altered the outcome of the 2016 election. \nOn March 22, the House Intelligence Committee voted to release a Republican-drafted report on the committee's findings in its investigation into alleged Russia's interference. The following day, Trump tweeted: \nHouse Intelligence Committee votes to release final report. FINDINGS: (1) No evidence provided of Collusion between Trump Campaign  Russia. (2) The Obama Administrations Post election response was insufficient. (3) Clapper provided inconsistent testimony on media contacts.",

      "Content": "On Saturday, several nations issued statements on the attacks carried out by the U.S., U.K. and France in response to the Syrian governments alleged chemical attack in Douma on April 7. U.S., British and French leaders conferred by phone, saying the attack had been a success. Canada, Germany, Israel and Turkey expressed support for the action. Russia called it an act of aggression, and Syria, China, Iran and the British opposition party expressed disapproval.\nPresident Donald Trump tweetedon Saturday, Mission Accomplished! after the bombing of three alleged chemical weapons facilities in Syria at 4 a.m. local time.\nA spokesman for U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May said she welcomed support from other world leaders for the strong stand the U.K., France and the United States had taken in degrading Syrias chemical weapons capability and deterring their use, defending global rules, and sending a clear message that the use of chemical weapons can never become normalized.\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron tweeted, \"By working together, in a coordinated fashion, we can definitively prevent the Syrian regime from carrying out chemical attacks against its own people. \nSyrian President Bashar al-Assad reportedly said, \"This aggression will only make Syria and its people more determined to keep fighting and crushing terrorism in every inch of the country. Syria has denied using chemical weapons on its people.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin said that through the strikes the US makes the already catastrophic humanitarian situation in Syria even worse and brings suffering to civilians. He added that the current escalation around Syria is destructive for the entire system of international relations.\nRussia called an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council on Saturday. U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres said, \"At this critical juncture, I call on all member states to act consistently with the charter of the United Nations and with international law, including the norms against chemical weapons.\nThe U.N. rejected a resolution proposed by Russia to condemn the bombings. Nine votes were needed for the measure to pass. Russia, China and Bolivia voted for it; Ethiopia, Equatorial Guinea, Kazakhstan and Peru abstained. After the vote, Russian Ambassador to the U.N. Vassily Nebenzia said, Today is a very sad day for the world, the U.N., its charter, which was blatantly, blatantly violated.\nU.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley said at the meeting, If the Syrian regime uses this poisonous gas again, the United States is locked and loaded.\nFrench Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said France would take the initiative in the Security Council on Monday to make sure that we are moving towards a peaceful settlement of the Syrian crisis.\nOther international reactions\nChinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said, We consistently oppose the use of force in international relations, and advocate respect for the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of all countries. She added, China urges all the relevant parties to return to the framework of international law and to resolve the issue through dialogue and consultation.\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel said: We support the fact that our U.K. and French allies took on responsibility in this way as permanent members of the U.N. Security Council. The military strike was necessary and appropriate in order to preserve the effectiveness of the international ban on the use of chemical weapons and to warn the Syrian regime against further violations.\nBritish opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn of the Labor Party said, Bombs wont save lives or bring about peace. This legally questionable action risks escalating further, as U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis has admitted, an already devastating conflict and therefore makes real accountability for war crimes and use of chemical weapons less, not more, likely. Some Labor Party members asked why May did not wait on military action until parliament was in session on Monday to vote on it, according to The Guardian. May said she would address parliament on the situation on Monday.\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Canada supported the decision for the strikes to take action to degrade the Assad regimes ability to launch chemical weapons attacks against its own people. \nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel fully supports the attack.\nIrans supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei called the attack a crime, and the U.S., British and French leaders criminals.\nIraqs foreign ministry said, Such action could have dangerous consequences, threatening the security and stability of the region and giving terrorism another opportunity to expand after it was ousted from Iraq and forced into Syria to retreat to a large extent.\nThe Turkish foreign ministry said the strikes were an appropriate response and that chemical weapons attacks against civilians constitute crimes against humanity.\nInvestigations into the alleged chemical attack\nInvestigators from the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) arrived in Damascus on Saturday. Syria has said it would allow them access to all required sites, RT reported.\nRussias ministry of defense said the chemical attack had been staged and that it had evidence that Britain had a direct involvement in arranging this provocation. Britain denied this. \nOn Thursday, Macron said he had proof that Syria used chemical weapons in Douma. During an interview on France's TF1 television, he reportedly said, We have proof that chemical weapons were used last week, at least chlorine, and that they were used by the regime of Bashar al-Assad.\nOn Saturday, a White House official said the administration believes sarin gas was used in addition to chlorine gas in Douma, AFP reported. \nResponding to a question about why the U.S. has not shared its evidence of a chemical attack, Pentagon spokeswoman Dana White said, a lot of this has to do with intelligence, and that she would be very happy to show evidence if she could. She said the U.S. was very confident about its decision to bomb Syria. \nDana White also said the U.S. mission stays the same  its to defeat ISIS. She added that the U.S. supports the U.N.-backed peace process for Syria and wants a diplomatic, political resolution to the Syrian conflict, but civilized nations can't let what's happened in Syria stand.\"\nSources: AFP, RT, The Guardian 1, The Guardian 2, The Washington Post",

      "Content": "On Saturday, G7 leaders issued a joint communique after meeting for two days in Charlevoix, Quebec. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the meeting had resulted in a consensus document that was supported by the seven member nations. After leaving the summit early and traveling for his planned meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, President Donald Trump tweeted he had instructed U.S. representatives not to endorse the communique based on what he called Trudeaus false statements regarding trade.\nThe joint communique covered economic growth, jobs, gender equality, security and the environment. One topic of discussion at the summit under the subject of economic growth was trade. On June 1, the U.S. implemented import tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum on Canada, Mexico and the EU. Mexico has implemented response tariffs, and the EU has announced plans for them. Canada announced response tariffs on $12.8 billion of American goods, which it said was equivalent to the value of steel and aluminum from Canada that would be subject to U.S. tariffs. \nSpeaking Saturday before boarding Air Force One to Singapore, Trump said about other countries trade barriers on U.S. goods that Its going to stop, or well stop trading with them. And thats a very profitable answer, if we have to do it. He added, Were like the piggy bank that everybodys robbing. And that ends. Trump also said, If they retaliate [with tariffs], theyre making a mistake.\nOn Saturday, Trudeau said steel and aluminium tariffs implemented by the U.S. on Canada on the basis of national security were kind of insulting to Canadians, who have fought shoulder-to-shoulder with Americans since World War I. Trump has said that tariffs such as the ones the U.S. is considering on automobiles could be justified on the basis of national security concerns: Its economic. Its the balance sheet. To have a great military, you need a great balance sheet.\nTrudeau said that during the summit, he told Trump, \"it would be with regret but it would be with absolute clarity and firmness that [Canadians] move forward with retaliatory measures on July 1, applying equivalent tariffs to the ones that the Americans have unjustly applied to us.\" He also said, \"Canadians are polite and reasonable but we will also not be pushed around.\nTrump tweeted on Saturday evening, Based on Justins false statements at his news conference, and the fact that Canada is charging massive Tariffs to our U.S. farmers, workers and companies, I have instructed our U.S. Reps not to endorse the Communique as we look at Tariffs on automobiles flooding the U.S. Market!\nTrump also tweeted, PM Justin Trudeau of Canada acted so meek and mild during our @G7 meetings only to give a news conference after I left saying that, US Tariffs were kind of insulting and he will not be pushed around. Very dishonest  and\n\tthe EU and countries other than the U.S. and Japan endorsing the G7 Ocean and Plastics Charter.\n\nAbout the G7\nThe G7 is composed of Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the U.S. The EU also attended the summit. The G7 was previously the G8, which included Russia until 2014, when the other countries suspended Russias membership after it annexed Crimea from Ukraine. \nOn Saturday morning, Trump said, I would rather see Russia in the G8 as opposed to the G7. I would say that the G8 is a more meaningful group than the G7. Absolutely. At his post-meeting news conference Saturday, Trudeau said having Russia return to the G7 was not something we are even remotely interested in looking at at this time.\nNext year, the G7 presidency passes from Canada to France.\nSources: AFP, G7, Global News, Reuters, The New York Times, The White House",

Trump authorized the U.S. trade representative Robert Lighthizer and the director of the National Economic Council Larry Kudlow to look into the possibility of re-joining such an agreement, more than a year after withdrawing from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP).\nAlso on Thursday, Everett Eissenstat, deputy director of the National Economic Council, said while in London that re-entering a trans-Pacific trade agreement was something thats of interest if negotiations were satisfactory.\nOn Jan. 23 of last year, Trump withdrew the U.S. from the TPP, which was negotiated to remove tariff and trade regulations among 12 countries but had not yet been approved by Congress. Trump had said during the presidential campaign that the TPP was pushed by special interests and disadvantageous to the U.S. \nIn January of this year, at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Trump said in a speech that the U.S. would consider negotiating with the TPP members either individually or perhaps as a group, if it is in the interests of all.\nIn March of this year, 11 nations signed a new trans-Pacific trade agreement that did not include the U.S., called the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). The countries that signed the new deal were Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam.\nSources: CNN, The Wall Street Journal",

Healthcare enrollees incur co-payments, or out-of-pocket costs, for visiting the doctor, receiving hospital care and filling prescriptions. The federal subsidies are only available to people buying silver level healthcare plans on the ACAs exchanges.\nIn 2014, Republican lawmakers filed a lawsuit against the White House alleging that the Obama administration was funding these subsidies illegally because Congress had not appropriated money for that purpose. The case is still pending. The current administration has been providing money for the subsidies on a month-to-month basis. President Trump has said he was considering ending the subsidies.\n(Sources: The New York Times, CNN, CBO report)",

      "Content": "In June 2016, several members of Donald Trumps presidential campaign met at Trump Tower in New York City with a Russian lawyer and others. \nWho was at the meeting?\n\nThe people in attendance were reportedly: \n\n\tDonald Trump Jr., Trumps eldest son\n\tJared Kushner, Trumps son-in-law and advisor\n\tPaul Manafort, Trumps campaign manager at the time\n\tRob Goldstone, a British publicist who set up the meeting, according to emails\n\tNatalia Veselnitskaya, a Russian lawyer\n\tRinat Akhmetshin, a Russian-born American lobbyist\n\tAnatoli Samochornov, a Russian-born American translator\n\tAn eighth person, a representative of the Agalarov family, may have also attended, CNN reported. (Aras Agalarov is a Russian developer, business owner, author and billionaire.) No one known to be present has publicly confirmed this. \n\nWhat happened at the meeting?\nSome of the people who attended the meeting have given information on the record about what they say happened. \nA Goldstein informed Trump Jr. of someone who had opposition research on Hillary Clinton, and set up the meeting with the Russian lawyer at Trump Tower, according to photos of an email chain Trump Jr. released last July. \nAccording to statements later made by Trump Jr., Veselnitskaya and Akhmetshin, they did not discuss the campaign and the Russian lawyer did not provide information about Clinton. Instead, Trump Jr. said Veselnitskaya talked about the adoption of Russian children and mentioned the Magnitsky Act. \nVeselnitskaya has campaigned against the Magnitsky Act, which the U.S. government passed in 2012 to withhold visas or freeze assets of Russian individuals who have been suspected of human rights violations. She also founded a group supporting the removal of a Russian law preventing U.S. citizens from adopting Russian children, which was put in place following the 2012 Magnitsky Act.\nAkhmetshin, who works as a lobbyist for the Human Rights Accountability Global Initiative Foundation, said he had been meeting with Veselnitskaya before the Trump Tower meeting and she asked him to join. \nThe foundation, records show, registered in April 2016 to lobby Congress. The foundation lobbied against the Magnitsky Act, according to testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Akhmetshin and lobbyists he hired sought to meet on the issue with U.S. lawmakers, The Washington Post reported. Akhmetshin, as well as Veselnitskaya, attended a House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing on U.S. policy on Russia on June 14, 2016.\nAkhmetshin was drafted and served in the Soviet Army for two years in the 1980s before moving to the U.S. in 1994. He said he has never worked for the Russian government or Russian military intelligence.\nTrump Jr. said he did not inform his father about the meeting at the time. President Trump said he did not find out about the meeting until 2017, shortly before the New York Times published a story about it. \nSpecial Counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating alleged Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and whether any members of the Trump campaign improperly coordinated with Russia, has questioned some of those who were present at the meeting.\nTimeline of events and disclosures\nJune 9, 2016: Manafort, Trump Jr., Kushner and Goldstone meet at Trump Tower in New York City with Veselnitskaya, Akhmetshin, and a translator. Trump Jr. agreed to the meeting after Veselnitskaya promised damaging information about Clinton.\n\nJuly 8, 2017: The New York Times publishes an article detailing the Trump Tower meeting. \nAlso July 8: Veselnitskaya says in an interview that she, Trump Jr., and the others discussed nothing at all about the presidential campaign in the meeting, and that she had never discussed any of these matters with any representative of the Russian government.\nJuly 9, 2017: Trump Jr. released a statement in which he said he was asked to have a meeting by an acquaintance [he] knew from the 2013 Miss Universe pageant [later identified as Goldstone] with an individual who [he] was told might have information helpful to the campaign. He said he was not told the womans name, that the meeting lasted 20 to 30 minutes, and that he had not informed his father of the meeting.\nJuly 11, 2017: After the Times article, Trump Jr. says he wants to be totally transparent, and releases images on Twitter of emails to and from Goldstone to set up the June 9, 2016 meeting. Trump Jr. tweets, The information they suggested they had about Hillary Clinton I thought was Political Opposition Research, adding that she had no information to provide.\nJuly 14, 2017: Akhmetshin discloses that he was at the Trump Tower meeting. He says he had lunch with Veselnitskaya before the meeting and she asked him to join her.\n\nJuly 24, 2017: Prior to testifying before a Senate committee in a private session, Kushner publicly releases an 11-page statement. Regarding the Trump Tower meeting, Kushner says he arrived late, quickly determined that [his] time was not well-spent at [the] meeting, and emailed his assistant to call his cell phone so he could have an excuse to leave.\nSept. 7, 2017: Trump Jr. participates in a closed-door hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee to answer questions regarding his June 2016 meeting with Veselnitskaya.\n\nSept. 14, 2018: Manafort, who was at the meeting, pleads guilty to financial crimes and agrees to cooperate with prosecutors in exchange for a more lenient sentence. The majority of the crimes relate to work Manafort did before his time on the Trump campaign and are not related to Trump.\n\nSources: CNN, CNN, CNN, Forbes, Kushner Statement, NBC News - Interview, The Atlantic, The New York Times, The Washington Post, Trump Jr. Emails",

      "Content": "On Tuesday, the Armenian parliament voted to reject opposition leader Nikol Pashinyans candidacy for prime minister. After a vote of 45 in favor, 55 against, Pashinyan called on Armenians, including police, to peacefully demonstrate in acts of civil disobedience. On Wednesday, protesters blocked some transport routes to the capital of Yerevan and its airport. Airport workers, medical staff, construction workers, university professors and students joined the protests by holding strikes.\nSome metro stations were closed in Yerevan on Wednesday, Al Jazeera reported. Trains were not running between Yerevan and Armenias second largest city, Gyumri, and 3,000 sewing factory workers walked out and blocked roads in Vanadzor, BBC reported.\nOn Wednesday afternoon, Pashinyan asked people on social media to unblock the road to the airport. Local media reported that protestors were allowing ambulances, police and military to pass on blocked roads, according to Al Jazeera. \nPrime Minister Serzh Sargsyan resigned last week after protests led by Pashinyan. Sargsyan had been president for two five-year terms prior to becoming prime minister on April 17. After Sargsyan resigned, former Prime Minister Karan Karapetian became acting prime minister.\nAl Jazeera reported that 30,000 to 40,000 people gathered at Republic Square in Yerevan during the parliamentary debate and vote on Pashinyan, which was broadcast on television screens in the square. Arman Saghatelyan, a member of the Republican Party that rules by coalition, said in a speech to parliament, Mr. Pashinyan, youre a good parliament member, but not qualified for prime minister. \nOf the protests, Pashinyan reportedly said, it isn't a fight for Nikol Pashinyan becoming prime minister, it's a fight for human rights, for democracy, for rule of law and that is why our people aren't tired and won't be tired.\" \nPashinyan was editor of a newspaper that sometimes criticized past presidents, including Sargsyan, and was imprisoned after leading protests against Sargsyan in 2008. The protests became violent and 10 people were killed. Pashinyan was charged with murder and organizing mass unrest, and released under an amnesty in 2011, BBC reported. He was elected to parliament in 2012.\nThe parliament is scheduled to hold another vote for prime minister on May 8. If it does not elect a new prime minister, elections for a new parliament would be called.\nThe ruling Republican party said on Wednesday it would not put forward a candidate for prime minister, and would support whichever candidate was nominated by at least one-third of the 105-member parliament, according to The Associated Press. Also on Wednesday, Pashinyan said he had the support of the three opposition parties in parliament, totaling more than one-third of parliament members. Pashinyan said these parties would nominate him for prime minister on Thursday.\nArmenia is a former state of the Soviet Union, and has about 2.9 million people.\nSources: Al Jazeera, AP, BBC",

Attempted suicide is currently punishable by up to one year in jail under Section 309 of the Indian Penal Code, but, according to the Times of India, the government is considering revising that law.\nSources: BBC, The Times of India, Supreme Court of India",

Such immigrants include asylum seekers and legal permanent residents who have been detained for suspected criminal activity. The court voted 5-3 to reverse a decision by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals that had ruled immigrant detainees had the right to periodic bond hearings at which the government must show clear and convincing evidence that continued detention is necessary in order to keep the immigrant in custody.\nThe case, Jennings et al. v. Rodriguez, involved permanent legal resident Alejandro Rodriguez, who was brought to the U.S. as a child. Rodriguez had been convicted of joyriding while a teenager, and he pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor for possessing a controlled substance when he was 24. He was detained for three years without bond hearings, pending a decision on whether to deport him. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) filed a class action lawsuit on his behalf. Others who joined the suit had been detained without a bond hearing for an average of 13 months.\nThe Supreme Court ruled that the lower court detected ambiguity in the wording of the law in question that said the aliens may be detained and noted the absence of any explicit statutory limit on the length of permissible detention. A section of the U.S. Criminal Code specifies that the Attorney General may release one of the detained aliens only if the Attorney General decides both that the person is not a flight risk and it is necessary for witness-protection purposes, according to the Supreme Court ruling.\nJustices Samuel Alito Jr., Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, Anthony Kennedy and Chief Justice John Roberts voted to overturn the Ninth Court's ruling; Justices Stephen Breyer, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor voted to uphold the right to periodic bond hearings. Justice Elena Kagan recused herself from the case. The Washington Post said she did not provide a reason for the recusal, though she had been involved in the case while she was solicitor general in the Obama administration.\nThe case is now scheduled to return to the Ninth Court for further consideration, including whether detained immigrants have a constitutional right to bond hearings.\nSources: NPR, The Washington Post",

      "Content": "House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) said on Wednesday he had seen no evidence to the contrary of Rep. Trey Gowdys (R-S.C.) initial assessment about an investigation of an FBI informant interacting with President Donald Trumps campaign to gather information regarding possible Russian contacts. Gowdy had said the FBI behaved appropriately when investigating information about alleged connections between campaign advisers and Russia, and that it had nothing to do with Donald Trump.\nRyan and Gowdy, who is House Oversight and Government Reform Chairman, were briefed last month by the Department of Justice on the matter. Last week, Gowdy said in an interview, I am even more convinced that the FBI did exactly what my fellow citizens would want them to do when they got the information they got. \nI think when the president finds out what happened, he is going to be not just fine, he is going to be glad that we have an FBI that took seriously what they heard, added Gowdy, a former federal prosecutor. \nRyan told reporters at a news conference on Wednesday that Chairman Gowdys initial assessment is accurate, but we have more digging to do.\nBackground\nSpecial Counsel Robert Mueller is investigating alleged Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and related matters, such as the possibility of coordination between members of Trumps campaign and Russians. Prior to Muellers appointment as special counsel last May, the FBI was investigating alleged contacts between the Trump campaign and Russians, including Russians who allegedly had information on hacked Democratic National Committee emails. \nThe FBI used an informant to gather information about this from members of Trumps campaign. The informant was an American academic who had worked in Republican administrations, according to The New York Times. \nLast month, Trump tweeted about the investigation into his campaign members on multiple occasions, calling it spygate. He said it involved spies in his campaign, put there by Democrats for the sole purpose of political advantage to help Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. \nOn Tuesday, Trump tweeted that spying began in 2015, before the FBI began its investigation of alleged Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. He did not provide evidence for his allegations of spying. \nLast month, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) requested a briefing from FBI and Justice Department officials on the matter of the FBI informant. Leaders from the Republican and Democratic parties in the House and Senate and the intelligence committees, including Ryan and Gowdy, attended two briefings from Justice Department and FBI officials. \nNormally I dont like to comment on classified briefings, Ryan said Wednesday. Let me say it this way: I think Chairman Gowdys initial assessment is accurate. I think  but we have some more digging to do. Were waiting for some more document requests. We have some more documents to review. We still have some unanswered questions. Ryan added that he wanted to make sure that we run every lead down and make sure we get final answers to these questions.\nNunes said the Justice Department should just provide us all the documents, everything were asking for and let us comb all the way through it and well issue a letter on Friday and well be done with this.\nRyan on the possibility of Trump pardoning self\nRegarding a statement Trump made saying that as president he could pardon himself, Ryan, who is not a lawyer, said, I dont know the technical answer to that question. But I think obviously the answer is, he shouldnt and no one is above the law. \nTrump tweeted on Monday that he had the absolute right to pardon himself, adding that he had done nothing wrong in regard to the Mueller investigation.\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said Tuesday that the issue was an academic discussion, and Trump obviously knows that a self-pardon would not be something that he would or should do.\nSources: AP, Politico, The New York Times, The Washington Post",

The injured students are a 16-year-old female who is in critical condition, and a 14-year-old male who is in stable condition, County Sheriff Tim Cameron said. The shooter, who has been identified as Austin Wyatt Rollins, later died in the hospital from a gunshot wound.\nThe armed officer who shot at Rollins, Deputy First Class Blaine Gaskill, is employed as a \"student resource officer\" at the school. He was uninjured after shooting at Rollins, who returned fire. Cameron said Rollins had a previous relationship with the injured female.\nThe shooting occurred at Great Mills High School in southern Maryland at about 8 a.m. local time, before classes began. Doctors pronounced Rollins dead at 10:41 a.m. The Washington Post reported that it was unknown whether Gaskill's rounds hit Rollins or whether he was struck by one of his own bullets.\nGreat Mills High School is about 70 miles southeast of Washington in Great Mills, Maryland, and has about 1,600 students. The school was on lockdown for a time after the shooting. After the incident, buses took students to Leonardtown High School, about eight miles away, where parents could pick them up.\nStudents at the school participated in student protests against gun violence last week. The school has held drills in the past regarding procedures in case of a school shooting. \nThe schools principal, Jake Heibel, said that in February there was a report of two students in a hallway talking about shooting and school, and that information about a potential threat at school was also circulated on social media. Heibel told parents at the time that the police had been contacted, and that the threat was not substantiated. \nIncluding Tuesdays incident, there have been 17 shootings at schools in the U.S. since Jan. 1, according to CNN, including shootings in grade schools through university. CNNs figure included accidental shootings and gang violence, fights and domestic violence. Two of the incidents in high schools, one in Parkland, Florida, on Feb. 14, and one in Benton, Kentucky, on Jan. 23 involved more than two victims.\nSources: CNN, The Washington Post",

      "Content": "What's going on in Zimbabwe with Robert Mugabe? We fill in some of these gaps below, with information about the leaders career and the numerous allegations against him and his government. We also give context about Zimbabwes government, how the president is elected, limits on presidential terms and laws governing a president's removal from officeall information that is especially pertinent given recent events. \nWho is Robert Mugabe?\nRobert Gabriel Mugabe was born in 1924 in what was then southern Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe. He trained as a teacher and taught abroad in Ghana in the late 1950s. He returned to Zimbabwe in 1960, and in 1963 helped form the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU) party. In 1964, he was accused of subversive speech and spent the next 10 years in jail. \nIn the late 1970s, Mugabe was part of a movement fighting against British rule in Rhodesia. The fight led to democratic elections being called, and in 1980 Mugabe was elected prime minister of Zimbabwe for the ZANU-PF party. He became president in 1987 after changes to the constitution created an executive presidency, in which the president is directly responsible for the government and the armed forces.\nMugabe was re-elected as president in 1990, 1996, 2002, 2008 and 2013. In the 2008 elections, Mugabe lost the first round to opposition candidate Morgan Tsvangirai. According to the official results, none of the candidates achieved more than 50 percent, prompting a second round of voting. In the weeks leading up to the run-off, Tsvangirai and other opposition candidates were arrested, and foreign diplomats investigating reports of election-related violence were also detained. In the end, Tsvangirai withdrew from the race, saying that a free and fair election wasnt possible due to intimidation and violence. The election was still held and Mugabe was declared the winner.\nAfter international intervention and negotiations, Zimbabwes constitution was amended (though not officially adopted until 2013), allowing for a power-sharing government with Mugabe as president and Tsvangirai as prime minister. The prime ministers position was abolished again in 2013 and replaced with two vice-presidents.\nSome of the allegations of fraud from the last couple of elections include accusations of systematic efforts to disenfranchise an estimated one million voters, from the Zimbabwe Election Support Network. The Network says this resulted in 99.97 percent of rural voters being registered, as opposed to 67.94 percent of urban voters for the 2013 election. Zimbabwes opposition has the strongest following in urban areas.\nWhat is Mugabe accused of?\nEconomy\nZimbabwes opposition and international organizations like United Nations Watch and the non-governmental organization Human Rights Watch (HRW) have said Mugabes government has had a negative effect on Zimbabwes economy and healthcare system, with the opposition saying it has collapse[d] during his rule. While it is true that Zimbabwes economy (as measured by GDP) decreased from $8.54 billion in 1982 to $4.42 billion in 2008, it has since increased to $16.3 billion in 2016. However, in terms of GDP per capita, its still lower in 2016 than in 1982.\nOne of the ways Mugabe has been linked directly to the countrys economic issues is through his program of land reforms. This program, adopted in 2000, saw land owned by white farmers designated for compulsory acquisition and seized by squatters; a sometimes violent practice that killed several farmers. This allegedly caused a reduction in Zimbabwes agricultural production, which before the reforms earned 45 percent of the countrys foreign exchange revenue. Zimbabwes trade balance decreased from plus 3.7 percent in 2000 to minus 16.8 percent in 2004, according to the OECD.\nPersonal spending\nMugabe has also been criticized for spending excessive money on birthday celebrations (about $1 million on his 90th) and on travels abroad for health check-ups. Zambian newspaper Financial Gazette, citing Zimbabwean Treasury figures, reports he spent $53 million on foreign trips in 2016, while Zimbabwe had a budget deficit of $1.4 billion in the same year.\nHuman rights abuses\nHRW reports Zimbabwe is repressing peaceful protests and allowing its police to use excessive force to stop protests. It has also reported violations of the rights of opposition members, journalists and activists. In its 2017 World Report, HRW cites a speech in which Mugabe called Zimbabwes judges reckless for issuing rulings allowing protests against his government. It also mentions a different speech in which Mugabe called the chair of Zimbabwes Human Rights Commission stupid, and he dismissed as absolutely false a report finding the government had denied food aid to opposition supporters.\nWhat sanctions are imposed on Zimbabwe?\nA number of countries and international organizations have imposed sanctions on Zimbabwe. In 2002, the E.U. issued sanctions, including travel bans and asset freezes for Mugabe, his wife Grace Mugabe, and around 200 other persons and entities with ties to Zimbabwes military and political establishment. The sanctions, which have been amended twice since 2002, also ban the sale and transfer of arms and other military related materials. The sanctions were imposed over the aforementioned land reform program.\nThe U.S. State and Treasury Departments first imposed sanctions on Zimbabwe in 2001. These also include economic restrictions, travel bans, and a ban on the sale of defense items and services. The Treasury cited concerns over the actions and policies of certain members of the government of Zimbabwe and other persons undermining democratic institutions or processes in Zimbabwe for its sanctions.\nZimbabwes elections\nThe Zimbabwe government established its current constitution in 2013. Under the constitution:\n\n\tThe term of office for the president extends until he or she resigns, is removed from office, or a new president is elected.\n\tA term is limited to five years and a president can serve up to two terms. Note: Prior to 2013, there was no limit on how long a president could remain in office, and the new rules did not apply retroactively to Mugabe. As a result, Mugabe could technically remain as president until 2023.\n\tThe president is elected by registered voters in Zimbabwe.\n\tThe next election will take place in 2018.\n\nZimbabwes government\nThe constitution allows for up to 350 members of parliament. Parliament has up to 80 members in the Senate and 270 members in the National Assembly.\nZimbabwes parliament has two primary political parties: Mugabes ZanuPF, which holds the majority, and the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC). According to the parliament website, ZanuPF holds 57 seats, MDC has 27 seats, and there are an unspecified number of seats for parties listed under other.\nHow to remove a sitting president\nA president either resigns, dies or is removed from office, at which point the first vice president assumes the role of the presidency. For this section, removal does not include losing reelection.\nResignation: The president may resign from office by written notice to the National Assembly Speaker, who then must give public notice of the resignation within twenty-four hours.\nRemoval: The Senate and the National Assembly must pass a joint resolution by at least one-half of their total membership declaring the reason for the presidents removal. The president can be removed for the following reasons:\n\n\tSerious misconduct.\n\tFailure to obey, uphold or defend the Constitution.\n\tWillful violation of the Constitution.\n\tAn inability to perform the functions of the office because of physical or mental incapacity.\n\nIf the resolution passes (or if half of the Senate and National Assembly agree on the reason for removing the president), the Committee on Standing Rules and Orders then appoints a nine-member joint committee of Senate and National Assembly members to investigate the presidents removal. The nine-member committee decides whether the president should be removed from office. If it recommends removal, then the Senate and the National Assembly must pass a joint resolution by at least two-thirds of their total membership in favor of removing the president.",

On May 14, the council unanimously approved a tax of $275 per employee at such companies, with the revenue designated to fund affordable housing, homeless shelters and outreach programs in the city. \nThe council said it had expected the tax to raise about $47 million per year. The tax was originally scheduled to take effect in January 2019, and would have expired after five years.\nThe No Tax on Jobs organization supported the repeal of the tax, and was supported financially by Amazon, Starbucks and Northwest Grocery Associated. \nNo Tax on Jobs said on Tuesday it had gathered more than 45,000 signatures on a petition to call for a referendum on the tax if the city council did not repeal it. Tim Ceis, a consultant for the organization, said it had obtained more than twice the number of signatures necessary to put a measure on the November ballot for voters to decide on the tax. One Seattle council member, who supported the repeal, said, we don't have the time or resources to change enough minds to be successful at the polls in November.\nOpponents of the tax said it would have discouraged investment in the city, while supporters of the tax said the presence of large employers in the city contributes to the higher cost of living there, Fox News reported. Seattle does not have a local income tax for individuals who earn less than $250,000 per year.\nCouncil President Bruce Harrell and six other members of the nine-person city council called a special meeting at which the vote was held. During the councils vote, some people chanted We are ready to fight. Housing is a human right! and Stop the repeal!, CNN reported. Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan supported the repeal.\nAmazon and Starbucks officials responded to the repeal. Todays vote by the Seattle City Council to repeal the tax on job creation is the right decision for the regions economic prosperity, Amazon Vice President Drew Herdener said. We are deeply committed to being part of the solution to end homelessness in Seattle and will continue to invest in local nonprofits like Marys Place and FareStart that are making a difference on this important issue.\nStarbucks Senior Vice President of Public Affairs John Kelly said the company welcomed the decision, and believes its the best path forward is to implement the reforms recommended two years ago by the citys own homelessness expert. \nStarbucks remains a committed partner to government officials, business leaders, and family service providers, Kelly said. Together we must work to bring families inside, once and for all.\nAmazon is Seattles largest single employer, with about 45,000 employees. The tax would have cost the company an estimated $12.4 million per year. Other businesses that would have been subject to the tax include Nordstrom, Boeing and Microsoft.\nSources: CNN, Fox News",

      "Content": "On Tuesday, Israel began enforcing restrictions on goods that pass through the Kerem Shalom crossing into Gaza, after announcing them the previous day. All exports from Gaza through the crossing were banned and imports can only include food, medicine and humanitarian equipment. The decision was made in response to incendiary kites and balloons that have been sent across the border into Israel by protesting Palestinians, Israel said.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said while announcing the restrictions on Monday that Israel would weigh down heavier on Hamass leadership, effective immediately. He said there would be additional steps taken, saying he would not go into details. \nPalestinians have been protesting the partial naval, air and land blockades that Israel and Egypt have imposed on Gaza since the 1990s and strengthened in 2007, according to the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. Israel said the fires from kites and balloons sent across the border have caused about $2.5 million in damage to Israeli farmland. Israeli officials said by mid-June, 412 fires had been started by incendiary flying objects, The New York Times reported. The Israeli army said it has used drones to shoot down 670 of the kites and balloons. \nIsrael has not used lethal force against people launching incendiary devices, the Times reported. It has fired warning shots and destroyed vehicles belonging to the people involved.\nHamas, the political organization that governs Gaza and has an armed division, has encouraged the launching of incendiary kites, according to the Times. Hamas called the crossing restrictions a crime against the people of Gaza. Palestinian Islamic Jihad, another armed group in Gaza, called the restrictions on the crossing a declaration of war. Israel and the U.S. consider both groups terrorist organizations.\nDuring the first half of this year, 48,424 trucks brought imports through the Kerem Shalom crossing, according to United Nations figures, an average of about 268 per day. About a third of the trucks contained food and medical supplies, the Times reported. About 40 to 50 trucks containing Gaza exports would leave each day when the crossing was open to exports, Al Jazeera reported. Construction materials and clothing imports would be prohibited under Israels order, while cooking gas would not, according to Al Jazeera.\nIn addition to restricting the border crossing, Israel said it would be restricting Gazas fishing boats in the Mediterranean Sea, requiring them to stay within six nautical miles from shore. Israel had permitted the ships a nine nautical mile range for the past three months. Gaza has 4,000 registered fishermen, according to Nizar Ayash, head of Gazas fishermens union.\nPalestinians in Gaza began protests on March 30 for the right to return for Palestinians whose ancestors lived in Israel before the May 1948 war between Israel and neighboring countries. Israel has not granted Palestinians the right to return. Israeli forces have reportedly killed at least 120 Palestinians since those protests began, with snipers shooting protesters who approached the border fence with Israel. Israel says it is protecting its borders. Some of the protesters launched incendiary kites and balloons as part of those protests. \nIn June, the U.N. General Assembly passed a resolution saying it deplores the use of excessive, disproportionate and indiscriminate force by Israel against Palestinian civilians, particularly in the Gaza strip. The U.S. has said Israel has the right to defend itself.\nGaza has a population of more than two million people. \nSources: Al Jazeera, Haaretz, OCHA OPT, The New York Times",

The conflict originated in 1998 over the border between the countries, five years after Eritrea declared its independence from Ethiopia in 1993. Fighting ended in 2000, after at least 80,000 were killed, with a peace deal that was never fully implemented. \n\nMondays meeting, which took place in the Eritrean capital city of Asmara was the first time the leaders of the two countries had met in 20 years.\nThe peace deal, called the Algiers Agreement, was reached in 2000 and never fully implemented. Abiy, who became Ethiopias prime minister in April after former Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn resigned in February, said in his inaugural address that he was fully committed to reconcile with Eritrea. In June, Ethiopia announced it would accept the terms of the 2000 peace agreement and later that month, Eritrea announced it would send a delegation to Ethiopias capital.\nSince the border conflict, there have been no flights between Ethiopia and Eritrea, the land border has remained closed and telephone lines between the countries have not worked. On Monday, Eritreas Minister of Information Yemane Meskel said on Twitter that transport, trade and telecommunication ties would resume. Family members across the border were able to phone each other on Monday, according to BBC. \nAbiys Chief of Staff Fitsum Arega also tweeted that the two countries are determined to close a costly chapter and eager to make up for lost opportunities putting the interest and aspirations of their people at the center. He added that the two nations would forge close political, economic, social, cultural  security cooperation, and would work on regional peace \nSources: Al Jazeera, BBC, CNN",

      "Content": "Iran tested a new ballistic missile on Friday after it was presented at a military parade in Tehran the same day. The missile, called Khorramshahr, reportedly has a range of 1,200 miles and is capable of carrying multiple warheads, according to Iranian broadcaster Press TV. The broadcaster did not report when or from where the missile was launched.\nThe U.S. says the Iranian missile test violates a 2015 agreement between Iran and six other countries, including the U.S. and Russia, an Iranian ally. Under the agreement, Iran agrees to restrict its nuclear program in exchange for lifting economic sanctions being lifted. Iran denies that its missiles are designed to carry nuclear warheads, and President Rouhani said Friday that Iran remains fully committed to the agreement, according to Press TV.\n(Sources: Reuters, CNN)",

      "Content": "On Thursday, the Verge published a 2016 internal video from Google that examines the possibility of collecting a kind of digital genetic code, or ledger, for a person that could be passed from one generation to the next, similar to genetic information. The video explores hypothetical uses of such a ledger, such as directing peoples behavior in order to reach a goal, making accurate predictions about decisions and future behaviors, or developing a species-level understanding of complex issues such as depression, health, and poverty.\nThe video was authored by Google employees Nick Foster and David Murphy. Foster is the head of design at X, a research and development subsidiary of Googles parent company Alphabet that looks for the intersection of a big problem, a radical solution, and breakthrough technology. Foster is also co-founder of the Near Future Laboratory, a research and development company based in California and Europe.\nXsays its mission is to invent and launch moonshot technologies it estimates could someday make the world a radically better place. The Near Future Laboratory says it is a thinking, making, design, development, and research practice focusing on what the future may be like and how to influence it towards more habitable near future worlds.\nContents of the video\nThe video, titled The Selfish Ledger, begins by mentioning an 1809 evolutionary theory by Jean-Baptiste Lamarck. The Lamarckian epigenetics theory, as it is called, postulates that experiences an organism has during its life modify its genetic code, and that is passed to the next generation. The video says Lamarcks theory is biologically inaccurate. In the area of biology, that theory was replaced by Charles Darwins theory of evolution by natural selection, after he published Origin of the Species in 1859. \nThe video said the Lamarckian theory is a useful metaphor for thinking about a so-called \"ledger\" of data, or a kind of digital genetic code. The ledger would contain information on users actions, decisions, preferences, movement and relationships obtained by analyzing data from technology such as phones and internet search engines. The ledger would evolve with time as more user data is collected, and this information could be passed to future generations after the user died.\nIn 1976, Richard Dawkins published a book called The Selfish Gene, upon which the videos title is based. The book presents a view of evolution in which a behavior is replicated in a species for the benefit of the gene, not the overall organism. The individual organism is described as a transient carrier or survival machine for the gene. The Google video proposes its ledger of user data could be thought of as a gene, and the user as the organism.\nIn the video, the narrator asks, What if the ledger could be given a volition or purpose rather than simply acting as a historical reference? The video says the examples it provides about this reflect Googles values as an organization, such as health and the environment. The video said Google would provide goals for the ledger that \"reflect\" its \"values as an organization.\" Users could select from these goals and based on their selections, Google could present options that allow the ledger to move closer to its goal,\" such as buying local produce. Over time, \"the users behavior may be modified and the ledger moves closer to its target,\" the video says.\nThe video also mentions a scenario in which a computer connected to manufacturing equipment makes personalized devices that collect more user data, thus filling in areas of missing data in a users ledger. A more complete ledger could provide more accurate behavioral predictions.\nThe video says multigenerational data could be used to make increasingly accurate predictions about human behavior and decisions. It adds, As cycles of collection and comparison extend, it may be possible to develop a species-level understanding of complex issues such as depression, health and poverty. The narrator says this could be considered analogous to modifying the human genome towards certain outcomes, such as disease prevention. The video says, it becomes possible for emerging users to benefit from the preceding generations behaviors and decisions. \nComments by X on the videos content\nThe Verge prefaced its article by writing that the video offers a stunningly ambitious and unsettling look at how some at the company envision using that information in the future. Regarding the video, an X spokesperson told The Verge: We understand if this is disturbing -- it is designed to be. This is a thought-experiment by the Design team from years ago that uses a technique known as speculative design to explore uncomfortable ideas and concepts in order to provoke discussion and debate. Its not related to any current or future products.\nSources: Business Insider, Daily Mail, Fox News, The Verge",

      "Content": "Microsoft President Brad Smith outlined actions in a Monday blog post that the company plans to take to prevent foreign entities from launching cyber attacks. The company launched a new Office 365 service called Microsoft AccountGuard, which Smith said provides free cybersecurity protection to all political candidates and campaign offices at the federal, state and local level, as well as think tanks and political organizations that the company claims to be under attack.\nThe internet has become an avenue for some governments to steal and leak information, spread disinformation, and probe and potentially attempt to tamper with voting systems, Smith said. Previously, U.S. intelligence agencies conclusions with high confidence that the Russian government ordered an influence campaign into the 2016 U.S. presidential election. U.S. agencies also alleged that Russian companies stole and leaked information from U.S. political organizations, including the Democratic National Committee, prior to the election. \nSmith noted Microsofts work to disrupt potentially illegal cyber activities by alleged foreign entities. Microsofts Digital Crimes Unit (DCU) last week successfully executed a court order to disrupt and transfer control of six internet domains allegedly created by a group associated with the Russian government, Smith said. The group is known as Strontium, or also by the names Fancy Bear and APT28. \nBy gaining control of Fancy Bears domains, Microsoft can prevent the alleged hacker group from using those domains and to review whatever content the group intended to display. Microsoft said two of the six domains had names similar to those of U.S. Republican organizations. \nAttackers want their attacks to look as realistic as possible and they therefore create websites and URLs that look like sites their targeted victims would expect to receive email from or visit, Smith said. \nThe sites involved in last weeks order fit this description, Smith explained, noting that some of the domains appeared to mimic those of political think tanks and the U.S. Senate, such as one similar to the International Republican Institutes domain. Smith added that Microsoft has no evidence that the domains were used in attacks or how the hacker group planned to use them.\nSmith said the company used its disrupt and transfer control technique 12 times in two years to shut down 84 fake websites associated with Fancy Bear.\nWhat AccountGuard provides\nAccording to Microsoft, the AccountGuard program is accessible with an Office 365 account, Microsofts line of subscription-based office products such as Word and Excel. AccountGuard would provide:\n\n\tThreat notification through The Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center.\n\tSecurity education services for campaign officials and other political organizations to help them activate features such as multi-factor authentication.\n\tPreviews of new security feature releases.\n\nFancy Bears 2016 election connection\nIn July 2015, Russian-based entities allegedly hacked the Democratic National Committees (DNC) networks, according to U.S. intelligence agencies. The hackers reportedly maintained access to the DNCs network until May 2016, when the DNC hired cyber security firm CrowdStrike to help the FBI find the hackers. \nCrowdStrike identified two hacker groups dubbed Cozy Bear and Fancy Bear that it said infiltrated the DNC network. Crowdstrike alleged that both groups worked for the Russian government.\nIn December 2016, Fancy Bear and APT28 were included in a list issued by the FBI detailing groups working with the Russian civilian and military Intelligence Services (RIS). The FBI said RIS activity was part of an ongoing campaign of cyber-enabled operations directed at the U.S. government and its citizens. \nRIS activities included spear phishing campaigns in which a person or group receives an email or notification that appears to be from a trusted source, but is really intended to steal confidential information such as passwords or social security numbers. The FBI report said APT28 was able to exfiltrate data from a U.S. political party in the spring of 2016, which was later given to the press and the general public. \nThe hacking activities are part of Special Counsel Robert Mullers investigation into whether the Trump campaign coordinated with Russia to influence the 2016 election.\n\nSources: Microsoft blog, U.S. National Intelligence Report, CrowdStrike, FBI Joint Analysis Report",

      "Content": "North Korea released three Korean-American detainees on Wednesday after U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un for about 90 minutes. Pompeo was in North Korea to make arrangements for a Trump-Kim meeting, previously announced by the White House and planned for late May or early June. The three Americans flew with Pompeo to Japan and were scheduled to arrive at Andrews Air Force Base near Washington at 2 a.m. local time on Thursday. \nPresident Donald Trump also said on Wednesday he would announce the location of the meeting with Kim within three days, saying it would not be in the demilitarized zone between North and South Korea.\nI am pleased to inform you that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is in the air and on his way back from North Korea with the 3 wonderful gentlemen that everyone is looking so forward to meeting, Trump tweeted. They seem to be in good health. Also, good meeting with Kim Jong Un. Date  and Kim Dong-chul, a pastor. North Korean authorities detained Kim Hak-song in May 2017 on suspicion of hostile acts, Tony Kim in April 2017 for alleged espionage, and Kim Dong-chul in 2015 for alleged espionage. North Korean authorities had sentenced Kim Dong-chul to 10 years of hard labor. The men were able to walk onto the plane without assistance, according to the White House.\nSouth Korean spokesman Yoon Young-chan said the release of the Americans would have a positive effect on negotiations at the upcoming meeting between Trump and Kim. Yoon also called for the release of six South Koreans detained in North Korea.\nThe North Korean official who said Kim had granted the mens release reportedly told Pompeo, You should [take] care that they do not make the same mistake again. This was a hard decision, according to Reuters.\nOn Wednesday, the state-run North Korean news outlet said, The U.S. is persistently clinging to the hostile policy toward [North Korea], misleading the public opinion. Such behavior may result in endangering the security of its own country.\nAbout 120,000 people are estimated to be imprisoned in North Korea without due process, according to the Committee for Human Rights in North Korea. These were the last of the American detainees, Reuters reported. Last year, North Korea released Otto Warmbier, 22, after holding him for 17 months. He was in a coma when released, and died within days.\nSources: BBC, CNN, Reuters, USA Today",

      "Content": "President Donald Trump is often criticized in the media for the amount of turnover in his administration. Has there been more turnover in his administration than previous ones? The short answer is yes. \nHow much turnover has there been?\nSince the Trump administration began in January 2017, at least 65 people in the executive office of the president or the White House have left their positions, according to figures compiled by the Brookings Institution, a Washington-based nonprofit public policy organization. The number is limited to A team officials, a designation made by National Journal in its Decision Makers editions, and does not include Cabinet secretaries or multiple people who held the same role and both left the position. The figure includes people who were fired, asked to leave, resigned or promoted. \nSeven Cabinet officials have also left office since the beginning of Trumps term, either resigning under pressure or being promoted, according to Brookings. This list includes former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and, most recently, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt. \nIn addition to the numbers above, six administration officials outside of the executive office and the Cabinet were appointed under Obama and then let go under Trump, including FBI Director James Comey, Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe, Attorney General Sally Yates, and others. \nOther Trump-appointed administration officials have left as well, ranging from personal aides to the president to administration lawyers. \nHow does this compare to past administrations?\nDuring Barack Obamas first term in office, 53 people in A team positions left their positions, according to Brookings figures. George W. Bushs first term saw 63 A team positions changing hands. As with the Trump figures, these A team numbers include only positions in the executive office of the president, and are based on the National Journals Decision Makers editions. \nBy this metric, Trumps turnover rate in his first 19 months in office has already surpassed Bushs and Obamas rates during their entire four year terms. Bill Clintons A team first-term turnover was 70. \nNotable departures\nHere are some of the notable people who have left the Trump administration: \nMichael Flynn: Retired Lt. Gen. Flynn resigned as Trumps national security adviser in February 2017, saying in his public resignation letter he had inadvertently briefed Vice President Mike Pence and others with incomplete information regarding his phone calls with the Russian Ambassador. He later pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about conversations he had with Sergey Kislyak, the Russian ambassador in Washington at the time.\nJames Comey: Trump fired FBI Director James Comey in May 2017, saying he concur[red] with the judgement of the Department of Justice that Comey was not able to effectively lead the bureau. Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein had written in a memo, I cannot defend the directors handling of the conclusion of the investigation of Secretary Clintons emails. \nComey had previously written memos about his interactions with the president. The New York Times first reported on the memos and they were later publicly released in partially redacted form. According to the memos, Trump reportedly told Comey that Flynn was a good guy who had been through a lot, adding that the president fired him because he misled Vice President Mike Pence. I replied by saying, I agree he is a good guy, but said no more, Comey wrote in the memo. Comey testified to the Senate Intelligence Committee that it was not up to him to say whether Trumps actions classified as obstruction of justice.\nSean Spicer: Spicer resigned as the White House Press Secretary on July 21, 2017, and was replaced by Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Sanders. Spicers resignation was announced at the same time it was announced that Anthony Scaramucci would be the new White House Communications Director, a position Spicer had been temporarily filling. \nReince Priebus: Priebus, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee, served as Trumps Chief of Staff for about six months, until July 2017. The President wanted to go a different direction, Priebus said on CNNs The Situation Room. The media had reported in previous months that he might be fired. \nAnthony Scaramucci: In one of the shortest tenures of the Trump administration, investment banker Scaramucci was White House Communications Director for 11 days, after taking over from Michael Dubke. He was the third person to leave that position in the Trump administration. \nSteve Bannon: Before coming to the White House as Trumps chief strategist and senior counselor, the Breitbart News Network executive worked as Trumps campaign chief executive starting in August 2016. Bannon left the Trump administration in August 2017, after magazine The American Prospect quoted Bannon disagreeing with Trump. \nBannon returned to Breitbart and remained there until January of this year. He left then after Michael Wolffs book Fire and Fury cited Bannon making disparaging remarks about members of U.S. President Donald Trumps family. Trump then said in a statement that Bannon has nothing to do with me or my presidency.\nOmarosa Manigault Newman: Manigault Newman, who first met Trump as a contestant on his television show The Apprentice, worked as an Assistant to the President and Director of Communications for the Office of Public Liaison. She was asked to leave the White House in December 2017 by Chief of Staff Gen. John Kelly. \nIn August 2018, Manigault Newman released a recording on NBCs Meet the Press of Kelly asking her to resign in the Situation Room. She then released a tape of Trump phoning her after she was fired, saying he hadnt previously known about it. \nAndrew McCabe: U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions fired FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe two days before he was planning to retire. Sessions said he fired McCabe based on a Justice Department (DOJ) report alleging he made an unauthorized disclosure to the media and lacked candor with investigators about an FBI case involving Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation. McCabe denied the allegations.\nMcCabe said in a statement published by CNN that he was fired because of events he witnessed after Trump fired Comey, and because he said he would corroborate Comeys accounts of his discussions with the president.\nRex Tillerson: Tillerson, a former CEO of ExxonMobil, served as U.S. Secretary of State for from February 2017 to March 2018, when Trump announced Tillerson would be replaced by then-CIA director Mike Pompeo. Trump had denied media rumors that Tillerson was going to be fired. \nScott Pruitt: In July 2018, Trump announced he had accepted Pruitts resignation from his position as Environmental Protection Agency Administrator. Pruitts resignation followed a letter from the U.S. Office of Government Ethics (OGE) that said the EPA needed to take action on alleged ethics violations by Pruitt, including his potentially receiving a discounted rental rate from a lobbyists spouse, inappropriate travel expenses and potentially misusing subordinates time, among other issues.\n\nSources: AP, Brookings Institute, Brookings Institute, Business Insider, CNN, CNN, CNN, C-SPAN, Document Cloud, Fox News, National Journal, White House",

The agreement was reached more thanfive months after Merkels CDU/CSU party alliance won the most seats in general elections. The CDU/CSU and SPD have governed in a coalition since 2013.\nSixty-six percent of the estimated 463,000 SPD party members who participated in the coalition vote opted to continue with the partnership; 34 percent voted against it. The parties agreed on a deal thatincluded plans regarding health insurance, taxes and refugee intake, and gave SPD the ability to appoint individuals to certain ministerial posts, such as the Finance Ministry. The SPD must now sign the agreement; the CDU signed it last week at a party conference.\nSPDs acting party Chairman Olaf Scholz said the coalition gives us the strength for the process of renewal we are embarking upon. Via the CDUs official Twitter account, Merkel said, I congratulate the SPD on this clear result and I'm looking forward to continuing our good work together for the good of the country. Merkel, 63, is scheduled to be sworn in for her fourth term as chancellor on Mar. 14.\nBackground\nIn Germanys general election in September, the CDU/CSU alliance received the most votes, at 33 percent. The ruling party had to form a coalition with one or more political parties to hold at least 50 seats in parliament. At the time, SPD leader Martin Schulz said his party would not enter into a coalition with CDU/CSU in the new parliament. The SPD had received 20.5 percent of votes, making it the second largest political party in Germany. Schulz has since resigned from his SPD position.\nIn November, Merkels CDU/CSU allianceunsuccessfully attempted to form a coalition with the Green Party and Free Democratic Party (FDP). According to German law, if a coalition is not reached, the parties can form a minority government, or the president can call for new elections.\nSources: Deutsche Welle, Los Angeles Times",

      "Content": "Iranian representatives asked judges at the International Court of Justice at The Hague to suspend U.S. sanctions against Iran, while Iran appeals their legality in the court. The U.S. reimposed the sanctions on Iran after withdrawing from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal. The court has not ruled on the suspension request, and may take weeks to do so. Also on Monday, Irans military announced it now fully controlled the Persian Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz, through which more than 20 percent of the worlds oil travels. \nIran argued before the court that the U.S. sanctions violated a 1955 bilateral Treaty of Amity, which the countries signed following the 1953 revolution when the countries were allies. Although diplomatic relations were stopped after the 1979 Iranian revolution, the treaty remained in effect. \nThe subject of the interim request is the imposition and reintroduction of sanctions and the announcement of the intensification of sanctions by the United States that target Iran, Iranian citizens and companies, and non-compensatory losses to the interests and rights of Iran, Iranian citizens and companies, Mohsen Mohebi, Irans representative at the court, at the beginning of the meeting. These measures are the violations of the 1955 Treaty of Friendship, Economic Relations, and Consular Rights between Iran and the United States of America.\nMohebi said the sanctions were intended to damage, as severely as possible, Irans economy, and called them a naked economic aggression against my country.\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the court via a letter that Irans claims were meritless, and an attempt to interfere with the sovereign rights of the United States to take lawful actions, including re-imposition of sanctions, which are necessary to protect our national security.\nThe U.S. claims the court does not have jurisdiction on the matter. It is scheduled to give arguments on Tuesday. \nBackground\nPresident Donald Trump announced in May of this year that he would withdraw the U.S. from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, brokered under Barack Obama, between Iran and 6 other countries. The deal, formally called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), had lifted economic sanctions from Iran in exchange for Iran making limits to its nuclear program and permitting international inspectors to visit nuclear sites. The deal included sunset clauses, or expirations to some of the terms, and did not prevent Iran from developing ballistic missiles, which Trump cited as reasons for the U.S. withdrawal. \nWhen the U.S. withdrew from the agreement, it announced it would re-impose sanctions on Iran. In July, Iran filed the case at The Hague over the sanctions, claiming they were illegal. That case may take years to adjudicate, The Associated Press reported. \nThe first set of U.S. sanctions were reapplied to Iran on Aug. 6. Trump also said in May that he wanted to decrease Iranian oil export to zero, and said the U.S. would consider sanctioning other countries if they continue to purchase Iranian oil. \nAt the time of the U.S. withdrawal, Iran said it would remain in the agreement if the other signatories, the U.K, China, France, Germany and Russia, guaranteed his countrys interests. The non-American signatories have also met with Iran to try to negotiate compensations to account for the reimposition of U.S. sanctions. \nControl of the Persian Gulf\nOn Monday, Iran said it had full command of the Persian Gulf and Strait of Hormuz, which is 21 miles wide at its narrowest point, with a round-the-clock presence. The Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) naval forces commander, Gen. Alireza Tangsiri, In the Strait of Hormuz, we control the lanes and the arrival and presence of ships according to the protocol which exists for the countrys waters and coastal strips, where all military and civilian ships and vessels are controlled. \n\nThe strait has 2-mile-wide shipping lanes going in each direction, and is the main shipping route of Saudi Arabian oil. A 2012 report by the U.S. Energy Information Administration said that a temporary blockade of the strait could lead to substantial increases in total energy costs.\nTangsiri said Iranian naval forces were prepared to defend the waters with their intelligence dominance and monitoring of the enemys physical presence, adding there is no need for foreigners such as the United States and the countries whose home is not here.\nThe U.S. has fleets in the Persian Gulf region, including in Saudi Arabia and Turkey, with aircraft carriers, ships, sailors and marines, occasionally engaging with Iranian forces. Between January 2016 to August 2017, an average of 2.5 interactions per month occured between US troops and Iranian maritime forces, according to the U.S navy.\nIn early August, Iran increased its naval presence in the gulf. An operations with more than 50 small boats, practicing swarming drills that could shut down the passage, Fox News reported. \n U.S. Naval Forces Central Command spokesperson, Lt. Chloe Morgan, said, The U.S. and our partners provide and promote security and stability in the region on a daily basis.\nIran said the U.S. presence in the region is detrimental to security and does not bring about any security, and was a ploy to have a presence in the region and sell arms.\n\nSources: AP, Fox News, IRNA, PressTV, Reuters",

The State Department said the sanctions were intended to impose penalties on Russia in response to its alleged interference in the 2016 U.S. election, its unacceptable behavior in eastern Ukraine regarding Russias annexation of Crimea, and other unspecified malign activities. \nThe State Department said it would impose sanctions on Chinas military acquisitions branch, the Equipment Development Department (EDD), and the departments director, Li Shangfu, for engaging in significant transactions with Rosoboronexport, Russias state-owned arms exporter.\nThe EDD reportedly bought 10 Su-35 combat aircraft in December 2017 and S-400 surface-to-air missile system-related equipment in 2018 from Rosoboronexport.\nThe sanctions imposed on the EDD prohibit it from financial and foreign exchange transactions under U.S. jurisdiction. The State Department imposed the same sanctions on Li, and barred Li from acquiring a U.S. visa. The sanctions also block companies and individuals within the U.S. from doing business with the EDD or Li.\nThe sanctions also include denying the EDD export licenses, which are generally required by the U.S. government for the export of munitions under the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls. \nChina Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Geng Shuang said Friday that the sanctions violated the basic norms governing international relations and seriously damaged the relations between the two countries and the two militaries. Geng said the transaction between China and Russia was part of their mutual cooperation in relation to defense and that the purchase did not violate international law.\nGeng added, We strongly urge the U.S. side to immediately correct their mistake and withdraw their so-called sanctions, otherwise the U.S. will have to bear the consequences.\nThe State Department also added 33 additional entities and individuals on Thursday to a list of people and businesses known to operate for or on behalf of the defense or intelligence sectors of the Russian government. \nPersons that knowingly engage in significant transactions with any person on the [aforementioned list] are subject to sanctions, the State Department said.\n\nSources: China MOFA statement, Export.gov, Rosoboronexport, U.S. State Department statement",

      "Content": "On Thursday, Intel announced that its CEO, Brian Krzanich, had resigned, effective immediately, over a violation of Intels non-fraternisation policy. Intel said an inquiry by internal and external counsel had confirmed that Krzanich had a past consensual relationship with an Intel employee, against company rules. The chip maker said its current chief financial officer (CFO), Robert Swan, would take the role of interim CEO. \nSwan has been Intels CFO since October 2016. His previous experience included being CFO of eBay for nine years.\n\"Given the expectation that all employees will respect Intel's values and adhere to the company's code of conduct, the board has accepted Mr Krzanich's resignation, the company said.\nIntel board chairman Andy Bryant said the company appreciated Krzanich's \"many contributions. He also said, \"The board believes strongly in Intel's strategy and we are confident in Bob Swan's ability to lead the company as we conduct a robust search for our next CEO.\nKrzanich, 58, joined Intel as an engineer in 1982 and had been CEO there since May 2013. During Krzanichs tenure, Intel acquired Mobileye, an Israeli company that produces chips and software for semi-autonomous and self-driving cars, for $15.3 billion. He also directed Intel, which makes chips for personal computers, to increase sales of chips to data centers. \nIn January, researchers announced that they had found two flaws affecting Intel chips that could allow hackers to read data stored in memory, such as passwords. At least one of the flaws affected other chip makers systems as well. Intel said in January that it had planned to disclose the existence of the flaws after it had made available more software and firmware updates to mitigate the issues.\nKrzanich sold about half his Intel stock during the time when the company knew of the flaws and had not yet disclosed them. The company said the sales were as part of a pre-arranged plan and not related to the chip issues. \nIntel also announced on Thursday that it expected its second-quarter revenue to be $16.9 billion, up from its previous forecast of $16.3 billion. It said, with accelerating data-centric revenue, the company is off to an excellent start in the first half of the year and expects 2018 to be another record year.\nSources: BBC, CNN 1, CNN 2, Intel, Reuters, The New York Times",

      "Content": "On Thursday, New York Attorney General Barbara Underwood filed a lawsuit against the Donald J. Trump Foundation alleging a pattern of illegal conduct that occurred over more than a decade. The lawsuit alleges improper and extensive political activity, repeated and willful self-dealing transactions, and failure to follow basic fiduciary obligations by the foundation. A spokesperson for the foundation called the lawsuit politics at its very worst.\nThe previous Democratic New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman began an investigation into the foundation about two years ago. Schneiderman resigned last month after allegations of subjecting women he dated to non-consensual physical violence. He has denied the allegations. Underwood, a Democrat, was appointed attorney general after Schneiderman resigned. She has said she did not intend to run for New York Attorney General in the next election, according to The Associated Press. \nSchneiderman ordered the foundation to stop fundraising in New York in 2016 after The Washington Post reported some of the foundations spending allegedly personally benefited then-presidential candidate Donald Trump. Among the payments cited by the Post were $100,000 to settle legal claims against Trumps Mar-a-Lago resort in 2007, and $158,000 paid in 2012 to another foundation to settle a suit over a hole-in-one contest at Trump National Golf Club in Briarcliff Manor, New York. After the investigation began, Trumps businesses reimbursed his foundation for these payments.\nUnderwood said, As our investigation reveals, the Trump Foundation was little more than a checkbook for payments from Mr. Trump or his businesses to nonprofits, regardless of their purpose or legality. This is not how private foundations should function and my office intends to hold the Foundation and its directors accountable for its misuse of charitable assets.\nA spokesperson for the Trump Foundation said Trump had given more than $8 million to the foundation himself or through his companies, and the foundation was able to donate more than it took in because it had little to no expenses.\nAbout the lawsuit\nThe lawsuit alleged that the foundations grants made Mr. Trump and the campaign look charitable and increased the candidates profile to Republican primary voters and among important constituent groups. Tax-exempt charities such as the Trump Foundation are required to follow rules, including not being involved in political campaigns. \nOne example presented in the lawsuit alleging the Trump Foundation was used for political gain involved a fundraiser in January 2016. During that time, before Iowas presidential caucuses, Trump took part in a rally to raise funds for veterans organizations. The fundraiser resulted in $2.8 million in donations to the Trump Foundation, according to the lawsuit. Trumps campaign manager at the time, Corey Lewandowski, wrote an email to Allen Weisselberg, chief financial officer of the Trump Organization and treasurer of the foundation, asking, Is there any way we can make some disbursements this week while in Iowa? The foundation gave five grants of $100,000 before the caucuses, with Trump presenting symbolic checks at rallies.\nUnderwood referred the findings of her investigation to the Internal Revenue Service and the Federal Election Commission for possible further action by those agencies.\nThe lawsuit seeks $2.8 million in restitution, the dissolution of the foundation and other penalties. Trump said he wanted to dissolve the foundation after the election, according to The New York Times. A spokeswoman for the attorney generals office said the foundation cannot legally dissolve while under investigation.\nThe lawsuit also calls for Trump to be banned from serving as a director of a New York non-profit organization for 10 years, and his children, Eric, Donald Trump Jr. and Ivanka, from serving as directors for one year.\nTrumps response to the lawsuit\nOn Thursday, Trump tweeted, The sleazy New York Democrats, and their now disgraced (and run out of town) A.G. Eric Schneiderman, are doing everything they can to sue me over the foundation. Trump added, I wont settle this case!  \nTrump also tweeted,  Schneiderman, who ran the Clinton campaign in New York, never had the guts to bring this ridiculous case, which lingered in their office for almost 2 years. Now he resigned his office in disgrace, and his disciples brought it when we would not settle.\nThe 31-year-old Donald J. Trump Foundation has given more than $19 million to charitable causes. \nSources: AP, Fox News, Supreme Court of the State of New York, The New York Times",

      "Content": "U.S.A. Gymnastics team doctor Larry Nassar was sentenced on Monday to an additional 40 to 125 years in prison after pleading guilty to molesting girls and young women at a Michigan gymnastics club.\nFor two days, Nassar listened to the testimonies of at least 48 athletes who said they were molested by him. Some of the accusations date back over two decades.\n\"The words expressed by everyone that has spoken, including the parents, have impacted me to my innermost core. I understand and acknowledge that it pales in comparison to the pain, trauma and emotions that you all are feeling. It's impossible to convey the depth and breadth of how sorry I am to each and everyone involved,\" Nassar said before his sentence at Michigans Eaton County Circuit Court.\nI do not believe there's a likelihood that you could be reformed,\" Judge Janice Cunningham told Nassar.\nIn 1997, two gymnasts reported Nassar, but an investigation was not initiated until 2004, when another girl reported abuse. The Associated Press said those reports did not result in criminal charges.\nMondays was Nassars third and final sentence. Last month, a judge from Michigans Ingham County sentenced him to another 40 to 175 years in prison for sexual misconduct. In December, a U.S. district judge sentenced Nassar 54 to 60 years in federal prison on child pornography charges. \nSources: AP, NPR",

      "Content": "Under the Trump administration, the U.S. has announced changes to its trade policies, including new tariffs, and is currently negotiating with trading partners. Weve selected highlights of developments in recent months:\n\n\tAug 16, 2017: The U.S., Mexico and Canada begin talks to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Representing the three countries are U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo and Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland. \n\tJan. 22, 2018: President Donald Trump approves tariffs on imported solar panel components and washing machines. This includes a 30 percent tariff on imported solar modules and a 20 percent tariff applied to the first 1.2 million washing machines imported in the first year and a 50 percent tariff on subsequent imports.\n\tMarch 1: Trump announces global tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. He signs an executive order authorizing the tariffs on March 8, to take effect later in the month. \n\tMarch 22: Trump instructs the United States Trade Representative (USTR) to consider increasing tariffs on Chinese goods. Trump said the tariffs could be about $60 billion. Later that day, Chinas Ministry of Commerce announced plans to impose tariffs on about $3 billion worth of 128 American products.\n\tMarch 23: The U.S. implements tariffs of 25 percent on steel products and 10 percent on aluminum products with temporary exemptions, originally extending until April 30, for Canada, Mexico, the EU, Australia, Argentina and Brazil.\n\tMarch 28: The U.S. and South Korea announce an agreement in principle on general terms for amending the 2012 U.S.-Republic of Korea Free Trade Agreement (KORUS FTA). A joint statement by the countries said the agreement addresses issues related to investment, tariffs, trade in automobiles, and trade remedies. \n\tApril 2: China implements tariffs on $2.97 billion worth of U.S. goods, including steel, aluminum, pork, and more than 100 other American products.\n\tApril 3: The USTR proposes a 25 percent tariff on a list of about 1,300 categories of goods imported from China, totaling about $50 billion per year.\n\tApril 16: The U.S. prohibits American companies from selling to Chinese phone maker ZTE Corp., for seven years. The company admits it had illegally shipped U.S.-origin items to Iran, obstructed justice and made a material false statement. The U.S. Commerce Department said the ban was a regulatory action and is unrelated to any ongoing trade-related actions.\n\tApril 17: China announces a temporary 178.6 percent deposit for Chinese importers to pay on purchases of U.S. sorghum, a grain used in animal feed and to make alcohol. The aim of the deposit was to correct unfair trade practices, the Chinese Ministry of Commerce director said, such as dumping, which is when companies export a product at a lower price than is normally charged in that market in order to eliminate competitors.\n\tApril 19: Russia asks the World Trade Organization for consultations with the U.S. regarding the steel and aluminum tariffs. India, China and the EU had earlier petitioned the WTO for similar tariff consultations with the U.S. Consultations allow member states to discuss a complaint and to find a satisfactory solution without resorting to litigation. \n\tApril 30: The Trump administration extends the temporary exemptions to the steel and aluminum tariffs, originally implemented on March 23, until June 1.\n\tMay 20: U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin says the U.S. and China have put tariffs on hold. According to a joint statement, China will significantly increase its purchases of U.S. goods and services. The U.S. had a goods trade deficit with China of $375 billion in 2017.\n\tMay 22: Chinas Finance Ministry says it will reduce tariffs on U.S. imported cars from 25 to 15 percent of the wholesale price, and reduce tariffs on car parts to 6 percent across the board (from the current 6 to 25 percent, depending on the type).\n\tMay 25: The U.S. administration agrees to lift its ban on ZTE Corp. under the conditions the company fire its management team, hire American compliance officers and pay a fine. \n\tMay 29: The U.S. announces it will implement 25 percent tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese products, related to the acquisition of industrially significant technology, according to the White House. The tariffs will go into effect after a list of specific products is announced on June 15, the White House says. Also, the U.S., Mexico and Canada plan to continue NAFTA talks. \n\tAnticipated June 2-4: U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross is scheduled to meet with officials in China to discuss trade relations, the Chinese Foreign Ministry confirmed.\n\nSources:CBC, CNN, ICE News Release, Census: Trade in Goods with China, NBC News, Reuters, The New York Times, USTR Press Release, USTR: US-Korea Joint Statement, WTO",

The bills, referred to as Stop Soros measures, specify sentences of up to one year in prison for facilitating illegal immigration. Non-governmental organization (NGO) workers could be jailed under the new law if an NGO helps or campaigns for asylum seekers, according to BBC. \nThe new law would criminalize helping refugees fill in forms or providing information to them on the process for seeking asylum, according to the Hungarian Helsinki Committee, a human rights group.\nThe new law also makes it so migrants cannot claim the need for protection if they are applying from a country where they are not subject to persecution, such as if they first arrived in another EU country before attempting to enter Hungary as asylum-seekers.\nInterior Minister Sandor Pinter said, \"The Hungarian people rightfully expects the government to use all means necessary to combat illegal immigration and the activities that aid it. Pinter added, \"The Stop Soros package of bills serves that goal, making the organization of illegal immigration a criminal offense. We want to use the bills to stop Hungary from becoming a country of immigrants.\"\nAmnesty International Europe Director Gauri van Gulik said, \"Criminalizing essential and legitimate human rights work is a brazen attack on people seeking safe haven from persecution and those who carry out admirable work to help them. \nThe Venice Commission of the Council of Europe asked for the vote on the bills to be delayed until it published its review of them on Friday, BBC reported. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the Council of Europe authored the review, and have criticized Hungarys new law as arbitrary, alleging it contravenes European law.\nThe Stop Soros legislation was named after George Soros, a Hungarian-born billionaire who, until last month, had a base of operations of his pro-democracy Open Society Foundations organization in Hungary. The NGO moved to Germany last month, citing an increasingly repressive political and legal environment.\nThe Hungarian parliament also passed a constitutional amendment stating alien populations cannot be settled in Hungary. The EU has a migrant relocation plan to distribute more than 150,000 Syrian, Iraqi and Eritrean asylum seekers throughout the EU, according to NPR.\nIn 2015, 177,000 migrants sought asylum in Hungary. Hungary accepted a few hundred of those applicants, BBC reported. In 2017, the number of applications for asylum was 3,200. Hungarian government statistics show 3,555 refugees living in Hungary as of April. There were 342 registered asylum seekers in the first four months of this year and the government approved 279, The Guardian reported.

Media outlets such as the Associated Press and BBC said the report could not be independently confirmed. \nOn Sunday, President Donald Trump tweeted that the area of the alleged chemical attack was in lockdown and encircled by Syrian Army, and that it was completely inaccessible to outside world.

Ross said U.S. production of uranium for military and electric power has decreased from 49 percent of U.S. consumption to 5 percent. Ross has up to 270 days to make trade action recommendations to President Donald Trump, who would then have 90 days to decide if and how to act on the recommendations.\nRoss said, The Department of Commerces Bureau of Industry and Security will conduct a thorough, fair, and transparent review to determine whether uranium imports threaten to impair the national security. The department said it consulted with industry stakeholders, lawmakers, the Department of Defense and the Department of Energy before starting its investigation, which is to include mining, enrichment, and defense and industrial use of uranium.\nTwo companies, Energy Fuels and Ur-Energy, petitioned for the Commerce Department investigation in January, requesting that the U.S. implement quotas to maintain American uranium production at 25 percent of the U.S. market. The companies cited national security concerns under Section 232 of a 1962 trade law, saying, In 2017, U.S. uranium production fell to near historic lows due in large part to uranium and nuclear fuel imported from state-subsidized foreign entities. Ross said the decrease in U.S. uranium production from 49 to 5 percent that he quoted occurred over the last 30 years.\nIn 2016, the uranium suppliers to the U.S. were Canada, with 25 percent of imports; Kazakhstan with 24 percent; Australia with 20 percent; Russia with 14 percent; Uzbekistan with 4 percent; and other countries totaling 12 percent, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Also, Russian state-run Rosatom purchased Canadas Uranium One in 2013, which gave it control over about 20 percent of U.S. uranium production capacity, according to CNBC.\nEnergy Fuels and Ur-Energy are held by Canadian companies, with all operations and employees in the U.S., The Washington Post reported. The companies said together they supplied more than half of U.S.-based uranium in 2017. They laid off more than half their staff over the past two years. Ross said three U.S. companies had stopped uranium mining operations in recent years.\nThe Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI) said of the Commerce Department investigation, We sympathize with the plight of uranium suppliers. However, NEI does not support the implementation of quotas as described in the petition. Potential remedies could put even more generating units at risk for premature closure, which would further soften the market for uranium. Energy Fuels and Ur-Energy say U.S. uranium production this year will decrease by nearly one half.\nMore than half of U.S. nuclear reactors are totaling losses of $2.9 billion per year, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance. Last month, Trump directed U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry to prepare immediate steps to stop the loss of fuel-secure power facilities, which could include nuclear power and coal-fired plants. \nThe majority of nuclear reactors on ships and submarines use a more enriched grade of uranium than the majority of commercial nuclear reactors, according to World Nuclear Association. A 2015 Energy Department study concluded that based on existing stockpiles of highly-enriched uranium new sources of fuel for naval reactors will be needed in approximately 2060.\nSources: CNBC, Energy Fuels, RT, The Washington Post",

      "Content": "Zimbabweans voted on Monday for a new president, in the first election since Robert Mugabe resigned from office last year after a military coup took over the government. Voters will choose from 23 candidates, including 19 men and 4 women, all running for the first time.\nThe ballot includes current President Emmerson Mnangagwa, who took over the presidency after Mugabes 37-year rule, and the leader of the main opposition party, Nelson Chamisa. Mugabe had been in power since Zimbabwe gained independence from the United Kingdom in 1980, ending white minority rule.\nIf no single candidate wins at least 50 percent of the vote, a runoff election will be held on Sept. 8 between the top two candidates. Official results are due to be released this Saturday.\nVoting began at 7 a.m. local time, with some voters lining up as early as 5:30 a.m. at the countrys 10,985 polling stations. Polls are scheduled to be open for 12 hours, until 7 p.m.\nMore than 5.6 million Zimbabweans are registered to vote, including about 43.5 percent under the age of 35. The landlocked southern African countrys total population is about 16 million.\nFor the first time since 2012, Zimbabwe permitted election observers from the U.S. and the European Union to monitor the vote. As of Monday morning, no violence or major voting irregularities were reported. Rights groups have alleged there was state-sponsored vote-buying and intimidation leading up to the election, the Post reported.\nCandidates\nMnangagwa, 75, of the ruling ZANU-PF party, and Chamisa, 40, of the MDC alliance opposition party, have led in the polls. Mnangagwa served in Mugabes Cabinet for decades, before coordinating with the military to remove the president from power. \nChamisa is a former activist who led protests against Mugabe in 1999, and later joined the MDC (formally called the Movement for Democratic Change). He took over party leadership in February after the previous leader died of cancer. If elected, Chamisa would be the youngest leader in Africa.\nMnangagwa and Chamisa have both promised to increase foreign investment and create jobs. The estimated unemployment rate in the country is as high as 90 percent, BBC reported. At least one million Zimbabweans have migrated to neighboring South Africa in search of work, according to the Post. Other election issues include education and healthcare, according to BBC. \nMugabe wont back successor\nMugabe, 94, said he would not vote for or back his successor in the Zanu-PF party, Mnangagwa. Mugabe repeated that he was sacked in the coup from the party he founded, and left office in order to avoid conflict.\nI can't vote for ZANU-PF. I can't vote for those in power. I can't vote for those who brought me into this state, he said in the previously unannounced speech from his home in the capital city of Harare on Sunday night. He added that he wished Chamisa well, saying he was the only viable candidate.\nMnangagwa alleged that Mugabe made a deal with Chamisa. We can no longer believe that [Mugabes] intentions are to transform Zimbabwe and rebuild our nation,\" Mnangagwa said.\nMugabe and Chamisa denied that they have spoken to each other.\nMugabe also denied on Sunday that he planned to have his wife, Grace, take over the party after him, and instead would have recommended that former defense minister Sydney Sekeramayi take over.\nChamisa comments on election delays\nChamisa said that his party would win unless there was election mischief. He tweeted that there seems to be a deliberate attempt to suppress and frustrate the Urban vote, and that the peoples will was being negated due to deliberate and unnecessary delays.\nAccording to an opinion poll last week cited by BBC, the second of only two such polls, Chamisas MDC party was 3 percentage points behind the Zanu-PF. Twenty percent of voters were undecided.\nSources: Al Jazeera, BBC, The Washington Post",

Ducey, a former business owner, has been governor since 2015.\nArizona also held a primary for the U.S. Senate, where Martha McSally won with nearly 53 percent of the vote, and 95 percent of precincts reporting. McSally, a current member of the U.S. House of Representatives, beat Kelli Ward and Joe Arpaio for the nomination. McSally will run to fill the seat vacated when Sen. Jeff Flake retires. \nMcSally held a moment of silence for late Arizona Sen. John McCain while accepting the nomination. Gov. Ducey will appoint a replacement for McCain at a later date. \nThe Republican primary election for U.S. House Arizona District 1 went to Wendy Rogers, and the Democratic primary for U.S. House Arizona District 2 went to Ann Kirkpatrick. Neither race had an incumbent. \nFlorida\nIn Florida, Andrew Gillum won the Democratic gubernatorial candidacy, with all districts reporting. Gillum is the current mayor of Tallahassee.

Turkey considers the YPG a terrorist group with ties to the banned Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK). PKK has fought against the Turkish government since 1984. The U.S. has previously supported the YPG with arms as a part of its fight against Islamic State in Syria.\nTurkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim said the aim of the operation against YPG was to establish a 18.6-mile (30 km) safe zone.

      "Content": "At a Nashville rally on Tuesday for Republican Senate candidate Rep. Marsha Blackburn, President Donald Trump criticized her opponent, Democrat Phil Bredesen. Trump said Bredesen was an absolute, total tool of Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and a tool of the MS-13 lover Nancy Pelosi, who is the House minority leader from California.\nEarlier this month, Trump referred to MS-13 gang members as animals, and some media reports characterized his comments as referring more generally to illegal immigrants. Pelosi said of Trumps comments, \"Calling people animals is not a good thing. She asked, you have to wonder, does he not believe in the spark of divinity? In the dignity and worth of every person? \nWhats MS-13? Read ourContext piece. \nBredesen is a former Tennessee governor and Nashville mayor who last ran for public office in 2006. He and Blackburn are running to replace retiring Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.).\nTrump said Bredesen had donated to Barack Obamas presidential campaign and Hillary Clintons 2016 presidential campaign. Bredesen supported her and he supported her ideas, he said. \nAbout the Republican candidate Blackburn, Trump said we need her in the Senate to continue the amazing progress and work that we've done over the last year and a half. Trump also said, When you win the presidency, for some reason, you always end up losing the House. He said it makes absolutely no sense, but I think what happens is you get complacent. \nThis election is a very important one, he added. So you have to get out. We need Marsha Blackburn to win. \nIn the 2016 presidential election, Trump won Tennessee with 61 percent of the vote to Clintons 35 percent. \nA total of 33 Senate seats will be on the ballot in the November midterm elections, according to Ballotpedia. The Senate is currently controlled by 51 Republicans, and has 47 Democrats and two independents who caucus with Democrats. \nTrump also spoke about his proposed wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, saying, \"I don't want to cause a problem but in the end Mexico is going to pay for the wall. He said, They make all of this money and they do nothing to stop people coming through Mexico from Honduras and all these countries. They do nothing. They are going to pay for the wall and they are going to enjoy it, okay? Trump may have been referring to the caravan of people, some of them seeking asylum in the U.S., who traveled from Honduras and other countries through Mexico to the U.S. border in April. \nMexican President Enrique Pea Nieto tweeted after the event, President @realDonaldTrump: NO. Mexico will NEVER pay for a wall. Not now, not ever. Sincerely, Mexico (all of us).\nTrump also spoke about other topics at the rally, including tax reform, jobs and wages, the U.S. moving its Israeli embassy to Jerusalem, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) voting against a bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act, African Americans voting for Democrats, and phenomenal health care plans to be released. The president mentioned people infiltrating our campaign, likely in reference to an FBI informant contacting members of his presidential campaign to investigate alleged contacts with Russians, according to The New York Times. \nAn estimated 5,500 people attended the Nashville rally, according to the local fire marshal. Tennessee primaries are scheduled for Aug. 2.\nSources: CNN, Fox News, Los Angeles Times, NBC News, The New York Times",

      "Content": "On July 20, President Donald Trump and New York Times publisher A.G. Sulzberger met at the White House in what Trumps aides reportedly had requested be an off-the-record meeting. On Sunday, Trump tweeted that he and Sulzberger spent much time talking about the vast amounts of Fake News being put out by the media. Sulzberger later said he met with Trump to raise concerns about the presidents deeply troubling anti-press rhetoric. Trump then tweeted that freedom of the press comes with a responsibility to report the news accurately.\nMercedes Schlapp, a White House communications adviser, confirmed the meeting took place, saying, The president regularly meets with members of the media.\nTrumps tweet about the meeting\nOn Sunday morning, Trump tweeted, Had a very good and interesting meeting at the White House with A.G. Sulzberger, Publisher of the New York Times. Spent much time talking about the vast amounts of Fake News being put out by the media  how that Fake News has morphed into phrase, Enemy of the People. Sad!\nSulzbergers response\nTwo hours later, the Times published a statement by A.G. Sulzberger in response to President Trumps tweet about their meeting. It said James Bennet, who oversees the Times editorial page, had accompanied Sulzberger to the meeting. The Times said the request by the presidents aides that the meeting be off the record has also been the practice for such meetings [with presidents] in the past. The Times added, with Mr. Trumps tweet this morning, he has put the meeting on the record, so A.G. has decided to respond to the presidents characterization of their conversation, based on detailed notes A.G. and James took.\nAfter referencing Trumps anti-press rhetoric, Sulzberger wrote, I told the president directly that I thought that his language was not just divisive but increasingly dangerous.\nI told him that although the phrase fake news is untrue and harmful, I am far more concerned about his labeling journalists the enemy of the people. I warned that this inflammatory language is contributing to a rise in threats against journalists and will lead to violence.\nI repeatedly stressed that this is particularly true abroad, where the presidents rhetoric is being used by some regimes to justify sweeping crackdowns on journalists. I warned that it was putting lives at risk, that it was undermining the democratic ideals of our nation, and that it was eroding one of our countrys greatest exports: a commitment to free speech and a free press.\nThroughout the conversation I emphasized that if President Trump, like previous presidents, was upset with coverage of his administration he was of course free to tell the world. I made clear repeatedly that I was not asking for him to soften his attacks on The Times if he felt our coverage was unfair. Instead, I implored him to reconsider his broader attacks on journalism, which I believe are dangerous and harmful to our country.\nSulzberger, who took over from his father as the Times publisher on Jan. 1, described his meeting with Trump as cordial, the outlet reported. He said by meetings end he felt Trump had listened to his arguments. He said the president told him he was glad that Sulzberger had brought up the issues and that he would think about them. Sulzberger said he bore no illusions that Trump would reduce his media criticism after their discussion, according to the Times.\nThe outlet also reported that Sulzberger told Trump that newspapers were starting to post armed guards outside of their offices due to increased threats against journalists. Trump expressed surprise that media outlets did not already have armed guards there.\nTrumps later tweets\nSunday afternoon, Trump said over multiple tweets, When the media - driven insane by their Trump Derangement Syndrome - reveals internal deliberations of our government, it truly puts the lives of many, not just journalists, at risk! Very unpatriotic! Freedom of the press also comes with a responsibility to report the news...accurately. 90% of media coverage of my Administration is negative, despite the tremendously positive results we are achieving, its no surprise that confidence in the media is at an all time low! I will not allow our great country to be sold out by anti-Trump haters in the...dying newspaper industry. No matter how much they try to distract and cover it up, our country is making great progress under my leadership and I will never stop fighting for the American people! As an example, the failing New York Times...and the Amazon Washington Post do nothing but write bad stories even on very positive achievements - and they will never change!\nPast Trump comments\nTrump has tweeted the phrase enemy of the people in reference to the news media before, such as last February, when he tweeted, The FAKE NEWS media (failing @nytimes, @NBCNews, @ABC, @CBS, @CNN) is not my enemy, it is the enemy of the American People! \nLast week, Trump spoke to veterans in Kansas City, Missouri, saying, Stick with us. Dont believe the crap you see from these people, the fake news. What youre seeing and what youre reading is not whats happening.\nPresidents have met with the Times publishers and editors in the past. Sulzbergers father, then-publisher of the Times, told then-President Bill Clinton that he thought of the papers editorials as tough love, according to Susan E. Tifft and Alex S. Jones, who have written a history of the Sulzberger family. Clinton reportedly replied, Well, just dont forget the love part.\nSources: AP, CNN, Politico, The New York Times 1, The New York Times 2",

Only antique ivory, acquired before the 1970s, had been legal for sale in Hong Kong since 1990 under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). Hong Kongs legislation is to phase out all ivory trade over the next three years by not renewing sellers licenses that expire before 2021. The legislation also increased penalties for crimes related to wildlife.\nLast year, Hong Kong authorities discovered two ivory dealers selling chopsticks made from non-antique ivory, obtained from elephants after 1990, in violation of CITES.\nWildAid, a non-governmental wildlife organization, estimates that up to 30,000 elephants are illegally killed each year, some for their tusks.\nChina, the worlds largest consumer of ivory, banned its sale a month ago. Ivory has been traded in Hong Kong for more than 150 years, according to Reuters.\nSources: Reuters, The New York Times",

Trump said the plan seeks to encourage innovation in the pharmaceutical industry, promote drug price competition, incentivize drugmakers to lower prices, and remove federal rules that may contribute to higher drug prices. \nTrump said medicine that costs a few dollars in a foreign country and hundreds of dollars in America was an injustice. He directed the U.S. Trade Representative to make this topic a priority during trade discussions with other countries, including addressing intellectual property and market access policies, the president announced.\nThe White House released a 44-page blueprint of its American Patients First plan on Friday, which Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said includes more than 50 actions that the administration has either implemented or proposed to reduce prices.\nActions already taken to reduce drug prices, according to the blueprint, include:\n\n\tThe Food  and\n\tRequiring drug rebates to be shared with patients in the Medicare Part D program.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services is seeking public feedback on a selection of the potential actions outlined in the blueprint.\nSources: DHHS Blueprint, White House Factsheet, CAPP, CNN Money, Fox News",

Some Arizona school districts have been closed since last Thursday while teachers went on strike for higher pay. Hundreds of teachers demonstrated in Phoenix on Wednesday night. After the law was passed, organizers called for an end to the strike. Some schools announced they would reopen Friday, others next week.\nThe budget bill includes more than $600 million for salary increases, with about a 10 percent raise the first year, and raises of about 5 percent in the second and third years. The average yearly pay for an Arizona teacher is currently more than $10,000 below the national average of $59,000, according to Reuters. \nArizona Governor Doug Doucey (R) said, Arizona teachers have earned a raise  They work incredibly hard. He said the budget plan also provides millions in flexible dollars to improve the states public education system. \nThe budget allocates an additional $371 million to education over five years, with $100 million this fiscal year. About $2 billion had been cut from schools capital funding in the state since the end of the last U.S. recession in 2009, according to the Arizona School Board Association (ASBA). Capital funding pays for textbooks, desks, school buses and school technology, among other things, according to ASBA.\nArizona has 1.1 million public school students, according to Reuters.\nEarlier this year, teachers in West Virginia went on strike for nine school days before obtaining a 5 percent raise, and teachers in Kentucky and Oklahoma also held walkouts over salaries, pensions and education funding.\nSources: Arizona School Board Association, Chicago Tribune, Reuters, The New York Times",

      "Content": "Starbucks said on Tuesday it would close all of its more than 8,000 stores in the U.S. and its corporate offices for an afternoon on May 29 to hold racial bias training for its nearly 175,000 employees. The coffee chains announcement was a response to an incident at one of its Philadelphia stores last Thursday, when two African American men were arrested by police after they did not leave the store when asked to. \nIn the incident, the two men walked into the store and at least one of them asked if he could use the restroom. In accordance with the stores policy, an employee said no because the men had not bought anything. The men sat down and were asked to leave. When they did not, the stores manager called the police. At least six police officers came and asked the men to leave three times. \nA man named Andrew Yaffe arrived and told police the men were waiting to meet with him. Lauren Wimmer, an attorney who represented the two men after they were arrested, said they were waiting to meet Yaffe to discuss investment opportunities in real estate. Police arrested the two men when they did not leave after being asked. \nPeople in the store recorded at least two cellphone videos of the police interacting with the men. Philadelphia Police Commissioner Richard Ross said these officers did absolutely nothing wrong. They followed policy.\nAuthorities held the two men for about nine hours, then released them because of lack of evidence that a crime was committed, according to a spokesman for the Philadelphia district attorneys office.\nThe Washington Post reported that a Starbucks official said the company does not have a uniform policy for all stores on when to ask people to leave the store  these decisions are left to store managers. The manager who called the police no longer works for Starbucks, the company said. \nAfter the incident, Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson spent some days in Philadelphia learning what we did wrong and the steps we need to take to fix it. Johnson said there are situations in which a call to police is warranted, but that such a call was completely inappropriate in this case. Johnson met with the two men in private on Monday and personally apologized to them, according to a company spokeswoman, Jamie Riley. Johnson said, Closing our stores for racial bias training is just one step in a journey that requires dedication from every level of our company and partnerships in our local communities. \nStarbucks said it would develop the racial-bias education training with outside help, including from Bryan Stevenson, executive director of the Equal Justice Initiative; Sherrilyn Ifill, president and director-counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund; former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder; Heather McGhee, president of Demos, a public policy organization; and Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO of the Anti-Defamation League.\nAfter meeting with Starbucks executives on Monday, Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney said the company would cooperate fully with our probes of the matter, particularly the Philadelphia Commission on Human Relations review of Starbucks policies.\nThere were demonstrations at the Philadelphia store on Monday and it was temporarily closed. It reopened Tuesday morning.\nSources: The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Washington Post",

The DOJ alleged that the nine individuals worked with the Mabna Institute, an Iranian-based company that contracted with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and other Iranian government and university clients. \n\nIn a corresponding announcement, the U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned the Mabna Institute, the nine accused individuals, and one additional individual charged in a separate case in 2017 for allegedly stealing data from U.S. entertainment company HBO.\nThe DOJ said the alleged cyber theft campaign intruded on the computer systems of 144 U.S. universities plus 176 universities in 21 other countries, 47 private sector companies inside and outside the U.S., the U.S. Department of Labor, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the State of Hawaii, the State of Indiana, the United Nations, and the United Nations Childrens Fund. The alleged campaign is accused of stealing intellectual property, according to prosecutors, including access to academic journals, dissertations and electronic books. \nThe alleged intrusions into the universities were part of phishing scams that appeared as emails from professors at one university sending article links to professors at another. The links then required professors to re-enter login information that was then copied, according to prosecutors. The alleged hacking into government and private institutions used password spraying, collecting publicly available emails and then attempting to log in using common passwords, the indictment said.\nDetails of the charges\nThe individuals charged are: Gholamreza Rafatnejad, 38; Ehsan Mohammadi, 37; Abdollah Karima, 39; Mostafa Sadeghi, 28; Seyed Ali Mirkarimi, 34; Mohammed Reza Sabahi, 26; Roozbeh Sabahi, 24; Abuzar Gohari Moqadam, 37; and Sajjad Tahmasebi, 30.

He questioned whether any such demands or requests were made by people within the Obama Administration. He said he would make his demand official on Monday. The DOJ declined to comment.\nTrumps comments on Twitter followed a Friday tweet in which he said reports showed there was at least one FBI representative implanted, for political purposes, into my campaign. The summer before the election, the FBI sent an informant to talk to Trumps campaign adviser George Papadopoulos, and later to campaign aide Carter Page, according to The New York Times. The FBI had received evidence the two had suspicious contacts linked to Russia, the newspaper reported.\nIn February, Republicans from the House Intelligence Committee released a memo that said there were concerns with legitimacy and legality in FBI and DOJ efforts to obtain a 2016 surveillance warrant on Page. Later that month, Democrats from the House Intelligence Committee released a memo that concluded the DOJ did not abuse the process to obtain the surveillance warrant. Committee Republicans released a point by point refutation of the Democrats memo the same day. \nIn March, the DOJ announced it would investigate how the FBI obtained the surveillance warrant on Page. \nIn a separate investigation, Special Counsel Robert Mueller is investigating possible coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia. \nTrumps full tweets\n\nReports are there was indeed at least one FBI representative implanted, for political purposes, into my campaign for president. It took place very early on, and long before the phony Russia Hoax became a hot Fake News story. If true - all time biggest political scandal!

The Associated Press said the troops principle aim is to reach the opposition-held Abu Zuhour air base and secure the road linking Syrias capital, Damascus, with its largest city, Aleppo.\nThe villages were previously held by opposition groups, among them the Levant Liberation Committee, which has been linked to al-Qaeda. Since late October, Syrian forces and their allies have campaigned to retake the northern Hama and Idlib provinces, the last two opposition-held provinces in the country. Russian forces and airstrikes are supporting the troops in this campaign.\nIdlib and parts of Hama have been designated as de-escalation zones in accordance with a Russian-supported agreement between the Syrian government and opposition fighters. The agreement aims to reduce violence in Syria and calls for a cessation of fighting in those zones. CNN reported that government airstrikes and violence by opposition fighters are both in violation of this agreement.\nThe U.K.-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said at least 23 people were killed and dozens wounded in an explosion in Idlib on Sunday. The Observatory also said 159 government soldiers and opposition fighters have been killed during fighting over the Murakabat base outside Damascus since Dec. 29.\nThe IHH Humanitarian Relief Foundation said an estimated 100,000 civilians have left their homes in Hama province for the Turkish border in the past week, CNN reported.\nSources: AP, CNN",

      "Content": "The United Nations Security Council continued to debate a draft resolution for a temporary ceasefire in the Syrian conflict, and the Russian ambassador to the U.N. announced an agreement had not been reached. Russian Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia presented new amendments to a draft resolution that calls for a ceasefire and the delivery of medical and humanitarian aid in Syria. He said the Security Council needs a feasible agreement, questioning how it would be enforced and whether the aid operation could reach civilians. Russia holds veto power on the council.\nRussia proposed the amendments after two weeks of negotiations on a draft resolution presented by Sweden and Kuwait, which began on Feb. 9. That draft calls for a 30-day ceasefire to take effect 72 hours after the resolution is passed. After another 48 hours, aid deliveries and medical evacuations would start.\nLast week, Russia negotiated an amendment that specified the ceasefire would not apply to the Islamic State and Al-Qaeda, which would allow the Syrian government to continue to fight against the groups. Russia provides support to Syrian President Bashar al-Assads government. \nThe Swedish ambassador to the U.N., Olof Skoog, said the council was leaning towards holding a vote on the resolution on Friday. The U.S., U.K. and France have said they support the resolution. Nebenzia said Skoog was calling for a vote fully aware there is no agreement on it.\nSpeaking at the U.N. in New York on Thursday, the Russian ambassador said, what we need is not symbolism, not decisions for the sake of decisions, but rather measures that are undertaken that are commensurate with conditions on the ground. Nebenzia also said that supporters of the ceasefire were creating a scandal in order to step up pressure on the Syrian government and taint the Russian government. \nThe Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a U.K.-based monitoring group, said at least 403 people have been killed in Syria since Sunday. The draft resolution says that 5.6 million people are in \"acute need\" of aid. During the almost 8 year war, an estimated 340,000 people have been killed and millions have been displaced. \nSources: AFP, BBC",

      "Content": "President Donald Trump announced on Wednesday evening that he would nominate White House physician Ronny Jackson to replace David Shulkin as Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Trump said the Hon. Robert Wilkie would serve as Acting Secretary until a new VA director was confirmed by the Senate. Wilkie has been the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness, a position that serves as assistant and advisor to the Secretary of Defense. Trump thanked Shulkin for his service in a tweet.\nCNN quoted an unnamed White House official saying that Shulkins so-called distractions were getting in the way of carrying out the Presidents agenda.\nIn February, the VAs Office of Inspector General (OIG) issued a report on an 11-day trip Shulkin took to Copenhagen and London in July of last year. It concluded the there was misconduct regarding the use of VA funds for the trip, and that Shulkin improperly accepted a gift. The OIG recommended, among other things, that Shulkin repay the government for his wifes airfare for the European trip. The VA had paid for her airfare because an email on the official record had shown a condition under which Shulkins wife would have qualified to have the department pay for her travel. The report alleged that Shulkins chief of staff altered the email.\nShulkin said he did not agree with OIGs conclusions and his attorneys said the OIGs report omitted critical facts that make clear the Secretary has done nothing wrong.\nIn a Wednesday op-ed in the New York Times, Shulkin said that some within the Trump administration saw him as an obstacle to privatization of the VA who had to be removed. He said he was convinced that privatization was a political issue and said he had been falsely accused of things by people who wanted [him] out of the way. He added that he was proud of his record and knew that he acted with the utmost integrity.\nJackson, 50, is a rear admiral in the Navy who graduated from the University of Texas Medical Branch with a Doctor of Medicine in 1995. He served in an emergency medical unit in Iraq and has been a White House physician since 2006. In 2013, Obama appointed him personal physician of the president. Jackson performed a physical examination on Trump in January.\nThe VA provides health care and other services to veterans and has an annual budget of $186 million and 360,000 employees. About 30 percent of veterans use private doctors outside the VA.\nSources: CNN, The Washington Post",

Of the uncounted votes, 198 went to Troy Balderson, 388 went to Danny OConnor, and two went to Joe Manchik.\nIf the margin of victory is less than 0.5 percent of all votes cast and counted, Ohio state law requires the secretary of state to order a recount.\nThe bipartisan teams of officials who administered todays special election did so with the professionalism that has become the standard in Ohio, Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted said in a statement issued Tuesday. This standard of professionalism will be upheld in the coming weeks as election officials begin the process of tabulating provisional and absentee ballots in order to certify the official election results. On Thursday, Husted said the state would continue to receive and count absentee ballots postmarked for Aug. 6 and received by Aug. 17.\nBalderson declared victory through a Facebook announcement the night of the election, without mentioning the potential for a recount. I am honored for the opportunity to represent Ohios 12th Congressional District, the statement said. I will work relentlessly for everyone in this district. Congratulations to Danny OConnor on running a hard fought race.\nOConnor has not conceded and continues to fundraise, asking voters to donate and make sure that every last vote is counted fairly.\nA Republican has represented Ohio's 12th Congressional District since 1983, according to the election website Ballotpedia.",

The Israeli forces fired live ammunition, rubber bullets and tear gas at protesters in five locations, the Palestinian Health Ministry said. The Gaza Health Ministry said two people were killed by tank fire. At least 1,000 Palestinians were also injured, according to the ministry, which did not provide a breakdown of injuries per location.\nThe Israeli military said it used riot dispersal means and firing toward main instigators after some people rolled burning tires and threw rocks at the border fence. Israeli Southern Command Maj. Gen. Eyal Zamir said there were attempts to carry out terror attacks under the camouflage of riots.\nAn estimated 30,000 protesters gathered in multiple locations along the 40-mile (65-km) Israel-Gaza border, the local officials and Israeli military said, on the first day of a planned six-week protest. The goal of the demonstration, named The March of Return, is to gain permission for Palestinian refugees to return to areas that their families had been displaced from when Israel was created in 1948. Some demonstrators carried tents with names of cities now in Israeli territory written in both Arabic and Hebrew. \nThe beginning of the protest on Friday coincided with Land Day, which memorializes the deaths of six Arab Israeli citizens in 1976 during protests against government land confiscations in northern Israel. \nHamas and representatives of other Palestinian factions planned the protest.\nAbout 65 Palestinians were injured in smaller protests in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, Reuters reported.\nSources: AP, Reuters",

      "Content": "People have a need to know. Journalists have a right to tell. Finding the facts can be difficult. Reporting the story can be dangerous. Freedom includes the right to be outrageous. Responsibility includes the duty to be fair. News is history in the making. Journalists provide the first draft of history. Newseum, Washington, D.C.\nPress freedom is not a static phenomenon. It has varied throughout the ages and in different parts of the world. Press freedoms are often weighed against other concerns and responsibilities, such as privacy concerns and protection of government secrets. This brief timeline highlights a few of the many developments related to press freedom and freedom of speech. This timeline is not meant to be comprehensive and has an emphasis on developments in the U.S.\n399 BCE, Greece: In an early recorded freedom of speech argument, Greek philosopher Socrates tells his prosecutors: If you offered to let me off this time on condition I am not any longer to speak my mind... I should say to you, Men of Athens, I shall obey the Gods rather than you. \n1689, Britain: In the first known legal guarantees of freedom of speech, the British Bill of Rights grants speech freedoms to members of parliament (though not expressly to citizens in general).\n1789, France: A century after the U.K.s bill of rights, the first parliament of the French revolution, the National Constituent Assembly, wrote speech and press freedoms for all citizens into the The Declaration of the Rights of Man. The free communication of thoughts and opinions is one of the most precious of the rights of man, the document stated. Every citizen may therefore speak, write, and print freely.\n1791, U.S.: The First Amendment is added to the U.S. constitution, based in part on ideas from letters written in Britain in the 1720s and published under the pseudonym Cato. The First Amendment says, Congress shall make no law  abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press.\n1919, U.S.: In the case Schenck v. U.S., the Supreme Court affirms that restrictions on freedom of the press may be legitimate in cases where the information poses clear and present danger, such as military strategy that could put American lives at risk or other threats to public safety. \n1948, United Nations: The U.N. General Assembly adopts the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which says, Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression.\n1971, U.S.: The U.S. Supreme Court rules in favor of The New York Times and The Washington Post, in the case New York Times Co. v. U.S., saying that the government could not place prior restraint (restraint before publishing) on the newspapers publishing top secret documents colloquially known as the Pentagon papers. (This is the subject of Steven Spielbergs Oscar nominated The Post.)\n1981, international: The Committee to Protect Journalists is formed, and works to advocate for journalistic rights and protections in repressive and dangerous areas. \n1993, U.S.: The largest award in a defamation (libel) case against a newspaper is awarded: more than $222 million. The Wall Street Journal is ordered to pay damages for a story about alleged corruption at a Texas securities firm. The verdict is later vacated in 1999 and the plaintiff drops the suit. (Journalists in the U.S. have a legal obligation to not knowingly publish false information that could damage a person or entity, regardless of the First Amendment.) \n2002, international: Reporters without Borders (RSF, for its French acronym) releases its first annual World Press Freedom Index report. \n2012, Myanmar: The Myanmar government removes a requirement for print publications to submit all of their content for government review before publication, a form of direct censorship; film content must still be submitted in advance. \n2013, U.S.: A federal court rules that journalists can be compelled to testify in criminal proceedings, even though the reporter promised confidentiality to his source. In 1972, a U.S. court had ruled that reporters could not be compelled to reveal anonymous sources. \n2016, Ivory Coast: The Ivory Coast become the most recent country (to date) to rewrite its constitution and include a guarantee of the freedom of expression for everyone, adding that the freedoms are subject to respect for the law, for the rights of others, for national security and for public order, and do not extend to propaganda whose objective or outcome is to elevate one social group above another.\n2017, Germany: Germany passes a law, known as NetzDG, that can be used to fine social media platforms up to $58.5 million (50 million) for not removing obviously illegal posts, such as speech that incites violence against certain groups. \n2018, Malaysia: Malaysia issues first conviction under its new fake news law, sentencing a Danish citizen to a week in jail for falsely stating the time it took police to respond to a traffic accident in a YouTube video. \n\nSources: AFP, BBC, Britannica - Bill of Rights, Britannica - Pentagon Papers, CATO Letters, Classroom Synonym, CPJ History, CSMonitor, Ivory Coast Constitution, Freedom House - Myanmar, Media Law Report, Newseum Status, Oyez - NYTvUS, RSF Index, The New Yorker, The Washington Post, UN Declaration, University of Michigan Law, USHMM",

Waves greater than 10 feet could reach the eastern coast of the peninsula, including Cozumel and Cancun. The storm is projected by the National Hurricane Center to pass into the Gulf of Mexico late Tuesday, and is expected to make landfall in eastern Mexico on Thursday as a hurricane. While Franklin is not forecast to directly affect the U.S., Texas could experience high surf, rip current, and possibly some minor coastal flooding on Wednesday and Thursday, according to The Weather Channel.\n(Sources: The Weather Channel, The Washington Post)",

      "Content": "The current war in Syria began in March 2011 after government forces fired on protestors in the Syrian city of Daraa, killing four people. \nThe protests at the time were part of the Arab Spring, a movement in which pro-democratic protestors in countries such as Tunisia, Egypt and Libya attempted to change their government leadership. That March, the protests began to occur in Syria, and security forces reportedly started to arrest protestors and respond violently. Protests were then held in several cities around the country. \nThe conflict developed into a civil war, with groups that aligned with Syrian President Bashar Assads government fighting various groups that claimed to be against his government. There are additional militant groups in the area, such as the Islamic State, which are opposed by both the government and other rebel groups. \nBelow well explore the various alliances and factions involved in war.\nCountries and groups supporting Assads government\nForeign support\nRussia, Iran and Iraq have given military aid to the Syrian government in the form of equipment, soldiers and financing. Russia has also conducted airstrikes against groups that oppose the government. Iran has encouraged Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shiite Islamist group, to aid the Syrian government during the war, BBC reported.\nWhile China has not reportedly been involved in the fighting in Syria, it has made public statements in support of the Syrian government. Egypt has reportedly provided public support for the Syrian government as well, allowing Russia to use its airfields to transport wounded soldiers.\nDomestic support\nAside from the aid from foreign nations, Assad, who is an Alawite Muslim, also has support from many Syrians belonging to the countrys Alawite minority. Many of the protestors belonged to the countrys Sunni majority, according to Encyclopedia Britannica, while many of the security forces that acted against the protestors were Alawites, a minority Muslim group that follows Shiite Islam. \nGroups opposing Assads government\nForeign opposition\nTurkey, the U.S., Saudi Arabia, Qatar, France and the U.K. have provided military aid such as equipment, soldiers and financing to groups that oppose the Syrian government. The U.S., U.K. and France also launched direct airstrikes on Syrian military targets after Assads government allegedly carried out a chemical weapons attack with sarin gas.\nJens Stoltenberg, head of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), has said that all NATO allies support the air attacks carried out by U.S., U.K. and French military forces on chemical weapons targets associated with the Syrian government.\nIsrael has also carried out airstrikes in Syria, reportedly against Hezbollah. In February of this year, it also announced that it had carried out a large-scale aerial attack in Syria against Iranian drones. \nDomestic opposition\nDomestic opposition to Assad and his government involves multiple factions that have changed names, merged or separated over the course of Syrias civil war. Syrian residents who oppose Assad and the government mostly belong to the countrys Sunni majority. \nSupreme Military Council\nThe Free Syrian Army (FSA) was one of the first opposition groups to emerge after the Arab Spring protests. Other militant groups adopted the FSA banner, but they were not centrally controlled by an FSA military commander. \nThe various FSA-related militant groups attempted to better align themselves in 2012 through the formation of the Supreme Military Council (SMC), which included one representative from each opposition front, or region in which groups were fighting Assad-aligned forces. SMC-affiliated militant groups include the Martyrs of Syria Brigades, the Northern Storm Brigade and the Ahrar Souriya Brigade. Some SMC-aligned militant groups work with groups that the U.S. has labeled as terrorists, including al-Qaida, BBC reported.\nSome independent militant groups, such as the Ahfad al-Rasoul Brigades and the Durou al-Thawra Commission, align with the SMC but do not participate in the groups regional organization.\nIslamic Front\nIn 2013, several Islamic militant groups aligned to form the Islamic Front. Their mission was to fully overthrow the Assad government and build a new Islamic state, according to BBC. The Islamic Front has reportedly driven out SMC militant groups from certain areas in Syria. Other SMC militant groups, such as the Syrian Islamic Liberation Front, have disbanded to join the Islamic Front. Although the Islamic Front has called for any foreign group to support them in jihad, the coalition doesnt include groups such as Al Nusra or the Islamic State (IS).\nUn-aligned groups\nTerrorist factions\nWhile different countries and groups involved in Syria may have different definitions for what constitutes a terrorist faction, the U.S. and U.K. governments consider the Al Nusra Front and the Islamic State groups to be terrorist groups fighting in Syria. These groups have fought groups aligned with the Syrian government as well as opposition militant groups for territorial control of the region.\nAl Nusra has reportedly been supported by IS and is linked to al-Qaida in Iraq. Al Nusra has maintained a presence in Idlib, eastern Ghouta, northern Hama, and western Aleppo provinces, according to Al Jazeera.\nIS currently has a small presence in eastern Syria. The U.N. estimated that IS, also sometimes called ISIS, ISIL, Daesh or the Levant, has about 10,000 fighters remaining in Syria.\nKurdish groups\nThe group known as Popular Protection Units, or YPG, has links to the Kurdish political party in Turkey, the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which has been fighting the Turkish government for autonomy. Turkey opposes the YPG for this reason. The YPG has taken over areas of Syria where government-aligned forces have retreated. \nThe YPG have fought both government and opposition-aligned forces. In February, the YPG asked for Syrian government assistance in defending Afrin, located in northwestern Syria near the Turkish border, against Turkish fighters. Although the government declined to assist the YPG, it did allow the group to send reinforcements through government-held territory.\nThe U.S. government armed the YPG from 2014 until November 2017, after President Donald Trump told Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoan that the U.S. would no longer do so, reportedly at Erdoans request.\n\nSources: Al Jazeera, Al Jazeera, AP, BBC, BBC, Britannica, Foreign Affairs, History, Kurdistan24, NATO, Newsweek, The Council on Foreign Relations, The Washington Post, ThoughtCo, UN IS report",

      "Content": "Mexicos presidential candidates held rallies on Wednesday ahead of Sundays vote to replace incumbent President Enrique Pea Nieto. The four candidates on the ballot include Andrs Manuel Lpez Obrador of the National Regeneration Movement (Morena party), former Finance Minister Jos Antonio Meade of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), former Speaker of Congress Ricardo Anaya of the National Action Party (PAN) and Jaime Rodrguez Caldern, who is running as an independent. Three polls indicated Lpez Obrador has a lead of more than 20 points in the race.\nBy law, Wednesday was the last day of the campaign season, according to The Associated Press. Lpez Obrador, whom the media describes as a leftist, held a rally in Mexico Citys Azteca Stadium with a crowd of nearly 100,000 people, AP reported. Anaya, whom the media describes as conservative, held a rally in Guanajuato state. Meade, 49, held events in Coahuila and Nuevo Len states.\nLpez Obrador, 64, said at the rally, The policies weve been applying for the past 30 years havent worked. We havent even had economic growth. Whats grown is corruption, poverty, crime and violence. Thats why were going to send their policies to the dustbin of history.\nAnaya, 39, said in Len, Guanajuato, \"Our coalition is the only one that can beat Lpez Obrador. He added, \"I'm calling on all good people, including those in other parties, those with no party  I am explicitly calling on you to cast a pragmatic vote.\"\nMeade said, The silent majority will win us this election. \nThe PRI governed Mexico for 71 years before the PAN won the presidency in 2000. Pea Nieto is a member of the PRI party. Lpez Obrador, formerly of the PRI and then of the Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD), founded Morena in 2014.\nLpez Obrador, who is often referred to as AMLO, was Mexico Citys mayor from 2000 to 2005 and is in his third campaign for the presidency.\nIn Mexico, presidents are limited to one six-year term. The president is elected by popular vote and there is no run-off system, according to the Mexican National Electoral Institute. The new president will take office on Dec. 1.\nEighty-seven million Mexicans are registered to vote, and hundreds of federal and state legislators, mayors and eight governors will be on ballots across the country. The National Electoral Institute said results will be announced around 11 p.m. local time on Sunday.\nThe polls\nPolls by newspapers Reforma and El Financiero, as well as by polling firm Parametria, showed Lpez Obrador was projected to win about 51 to 54 percent of the votes. The number of people who did not choose a candidate in the polls ranged between 15 and 29 percent. The Reforma poll of 1,200 registered voters with a margin of error of four percentage points had Lpez Obrador at 51 percent of the vote, Anaya at 27 percent and Meade at 19 percent. Parametria also had Anaya in second place, while El Financiero had Meade in second place.\nA Berumen poll indicated Sundays elections could result in the PRI losing about half its seats in congress. Parametrias poll put the Morena party at 41 percent of the vote for the lower house of Congress after excluding people who did not choose a candidate in the survey. The same poll had Morena with 38 percent of the vote for the senate, with the PAN in second place. The sample size of the poll was not large enough to project the number of seats to be won by the parties in either house, according to Reuters.\nThe Consulta Mitofsky polling group estimated that PAN could lose a quarter of its seats in the chamber of deputies and more than half in the senate, Financial Times reported.\nIssues in Mexico\nA 2017 survey of 1,000 Mexicans by the Pew Research Center found that 13 percent were satisfied and 85 percent dissatisfied with the way things were going in their country. The top eight very big problems identified by survey participants were crime, corrupt political leaders, drug cartel-related violence, rising prices, corrupt police officers, lack of employment opportunities, poor-quality schools, and the gap between rich and poor.\nThere were a record 25,000 murders in Mexico last year, according to AFP. Etellekt, a risk analysis consulting company, reported 48 killings of candidates for local office during this campaign.\nAccording to the Mexican government, 43.6 percent of the countrys population was poor in 2016 (equivalent to 53.4 million out of a total 122 million), while 7.6 percent was in extreme poverty, meaning they cannot afford basic items. In 2014, the government defined the poverty line as living on no more than $2,542 pesos ($157.70) per month in cities, and $1,615 pesos (about $100) in rural areas, with incomes for extreme poverty amounting to about half those numbers. In its poverty calculations, the government also considers other factors such as healthcare and education, Reuters reported.\nIn the first quarter of 2018, the Mexican unemployment rate was 3.2 percent, according to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). OECD notes that unemployed people are those who report that they are without work, that they are available for work and that they have taken active steps to find work in the last four weeks. Individuals who have stopped looking for work are not included in the unemployment numbers.\nLpez Obradors proposals\nLpez Obrador has proposed reviewing existing contracts under which some of the oil sector was privatized during Pea Nietos tenure. Lpez Obrador has said he would halve the presidential salary and continue living in his own house, if elected. \"I'm going to govern by example, with austerity, he has said. \nHe also said he would reduce poverty and unemployment, and eliminate Mexicos secret service and intelligence agency. \nLpez Obrador has said he would implement agricultural subsidies, higher pensions, and monetary grants or apprenticeships for young people who are not working or in school, according to Shannon ONeil of the Council on Foreign Relations.\nAnayas proposals\nAnaya, who was formerly president of the PAN, has proposed a universal minimum income and an international commission to investigate alleged corruption by the current government, Reuters reported.\nMeades proposals\nMeade has proposed pursuing drug cartels finances, increasing teachers pay and keeping structural reforms implemented under Pea Nieto, according to The Guardian. He has also said he would reduce corruption.\nSources: AFP, AP, Facebook, Financial Times, Fox News, Pew Research Center, Reuters 1, Reuters 2, Reuters 3, The Guardian, The New York Times",

Philippe Dulieu, a spokesperson for the prosecutors office, said the event was classified as a terrorist incident. Belgian Interior Minister Jan Jambon said investigators were trying to determine exactly what happened.\nBelgian public broadcaster RTBF reported the suspect was a 36-year-old man who had been released from prison on Monday after serving time for drug offenses.\nLige Mayor Willy Demeyer said physical and psychological support would be provided to the victims families.

      "Content": "On Wednesday, lawyers for Michael Cohen, one of President Donald Trumps attorneys, withdrew a defamation lawsuit against media company BuzzFeed and political research firm Fusion GPS over a dossier BuzzFeed published last year. Cohens attorney, David Schwartz, said that given the events that have unfolded, and the time, attention and resources needed to prosecute these matters, we have dismissed the matters, despite their merits. \nLast week, the FBI raided Cohens office and hotel room. Last Friday, the Justice Department said Cohen is under criminal investigation regarding his business dealings.\nSchwartz said, The decision to voluntarily discontinue these cases was a difficult one. We believe the defendants defamed my client, and vindicating Mr. Cohens rights was  and still remains  important. \nThe dossier, prepared by former British spy Christopher Steele while working for Fusion GPS, alleged that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election in coordination with Trumps campaign. The dossier also claimed that Cohen met with Russian officials in Prague during the 2016 campaign, which Cohen denies.\nIn January, Cohen filed a lawsuit against Fusion GPS in a federal court, and a lawsuit against Buzzfeed and four of its employees in a New York state court. The suits said the dossier contained false and defamatory information that caused harm to [Cohens] personal and professional reputation, current business interests and the impairment of business opportunities. Fusion GPS called Cohens suit against the company a meritless complaint.\nWhen Buzzfeed published the dossier in January of last year, it said, The allegations are unverified, and the report contains errors. Buzzfeed said it published the dossier because it was an important part of the governments investigation into potential collusion between the Trump Campaign and Russia. Its interest to the public is, and always has been, obvious.\nThe owners of a Russian bank have also filed a lawsuit against Buzzfeed for publishing the dossier.\nSources: Buzzfeed, NBC News, The Washington Post",

If confirmed by the Senate, Pompeo would replace Trumps former Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, who left the position last month.\nPompeo reportedly met with Kim Jong-un during a visit to Pyongyang earlier this month, the highest level meeting between a North Korean leader and an American official since 2000, when then-Secretary of State Madeleine Albright met with Kim Jong-Il, who was Kim Jong Uns father.

      "Content": "On Monday, Facebook released a new blog post series discussing social media and its purported effects on democracy. The new Hard Questions series included three new posts featuring two Facebook executives and a Harvard Law School professor. \nFacebook's head of civic engagement, Samidh Chakrabarti, said in his post that \"Facebook was originally designed to connect friends and family  and it has excelled at that. But as unprecedented numbers of people channel their political energy through this medium, it's being used in unforeseen ways with societal repercussions that were never anticipated.\"\nChakrabarti also said social media amplifies human intent  both good and bad, and that in 2016 Facebook was far too slow to recognize how bad actors were abusing our platform. He added that the social network is working to neutralize potential risks, and that it has implemented a fact-checking process on news posted on the platform, as well as new transparency rules for political advertising, among other initiatives. \nIn her post, Facebook Global Politics and Government Outreach Director Katie Harbath said, \"From the Arab Spring to robust elections around the globe, social media seemed like a positive. The last US presidential campaign changed that, with foreign interference that Facebook should have been quicker to identify to the rise of 'fake news' and echo chambers.\"\nHarvard Law School professor Cass R. Sunstein wrote, The uses of Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and others depends on a variety of factors, including individual choices, relevant algorithms, social norms, and the architectural judgments of the platform designers themselves.\nAs part of the new series, Facebook will reportedly invite other experts to discuss the matter, including social media scholar and former president of Estonia Toomas Hendrik Ilves and University of Sydney professor Ariadne Vromen.\nThe Hard Questions series has included posts about hate speech, childrens use of online platforms, the benefits and disadvantages of spending time on social media networks, and safety considerations regarding face recognition technology, among others.\nSources: CNN, Engadget, Fox, Mashable",

      "Content": "At least 10 people were killed and dozens hospitalized after a family of suicide bombers attacked three Christian churches in Muslim-majority Indonesia on Sunday morning, CNN reported. The attacks occurred in Surabaya, a port city on the east coast of Java Island. The family of six, which included two children and two teens, targeted the Diponegoro Indonesian Christian Church, the Pentecost Central Church and the Santa Maria Catholic Church. Police have closed off the three churches as they investigate the incidents.\nAt about 7:30 a.m. local time, the familys two sons  aged 16 and 18  rode motorcycles into Santa Maria Catholic Church and detonated explosives they were carrying. Police spokesman Frans Barung Mangera said the next blasts went off at 7:35 a.m. and 8 a.m. BBC reported that the final two attacks occurred in five-minute increments following the first. The mother and her two daughters  aged 9 and 12  detonated explosives they were carrying at Diponegoro Indonesian Christian Church. The father drove a bomb-laden car into the grounds of Surabaya Centre Pentecostal Church. The latter two attacks occurred sequentially. Media outlets reported inconsistencies in the timeline of events.\nFour people died in the explosion at the Santa Maria Catholic Church, while two people were killed at each of the final two attacks. Two people later died at a hospital. Sundays bombing is the deadliest in Indonesia since 2005, when 22 people were killed on the island of Sulawesi.\nPolice Chief Tito Karnavian said the family belonged to an Indonesian Islamic State-inspired network, Jemaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD). IS Amaq News Agency described the bombings as martyrdom attacks and claimed responsibility for them. Neither IS nor security sources have provided proof to substantiate the claim.\nAlso on Sunday, police said they killed four suspected members of JAD in Cianjur, West Java, and arrested two others.\nResponses to the attacks\nIndonesias Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi tweeted her condolences to the bombing victims, writing, Deepest condolences to the victims and families of the bombing victims in Surabaya.\nDuring his weekly Sunday audience in St. Peters Square, Pope Francis reportedly said, Together we invoke the God of peace to cease these violent actions, and in the heart of all find space not for hatred and violence but for reconciliation and fraternity.\nThe U.S. Embassy in Jakarta issued a statement condemning the attacks: These attacks on peaceful worshipers are an affront to the tolerance and diversity embraced by Indonesians. The United States stands with the people of Indonesia, and we offer our deepest condolences to the families of the victims.\nPast attacks in Indonesia\nIS has executed previous attacks in Indonesia. Last May, two suicide bombers attacked a bus station in the capital of Jakarta. In 2016, IS claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing and shooting also in Jakarta.\nJihadist attacks have also taken place in Indonesia before IS emerged. In 2002, al-Qaeda-linked bombings killed over 200 people.\nSources: BBC, CNN",

      "Content": "On Thursday, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) Health Minister Oly Ilunga Kalenga said there was one confirmed case of Ebola in Mbandaka city, which is adjacent to the Congo River. The city of about one million is approximately 80 miles (130 km) from rural areas where cases of the disease have been previously reported. On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that in the past five weeks there were three confirmed, 21 suspected and 20 probable cases of Ebola in the country; 23 of them resulted in death.\nEbola is a virus that is transmitted from human to human through contact with bodily fluids, and has an average case fatality rate of about 50 percent, according to CNN. The disease can also be transmitted to humans from wild animals such as fruit bats, chimpanzees, gorillas, monkeys, antelope and porcupines. The incubation period ranges from two to 21 days, and symptoms include fever, fatigue, muscle and joint pain, headaches and a sore throat, which are sometimes followed by vomiting, diarrhea, skin lesions, kidney and liver failure, and internal and external bleeding.\nThe WHO has called an emergency meeting of experts to discuss the potential spread of the disease, and will meet Friday to decide if it should declare an international public health emergency as it did during the 2014-2016 West Africa Ebola outbreak. That outbreak spread to the capital cities of Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, and killed 11,300 people. WHO has not recommended trade or travel restrictions within DRC or internationally.\nWHO official Peter Salama said the diseases presence in a city was a major development in the outbreak. He added that there is now potential for an increase in cases.\nOn Wednesday, more than 4,000 doses of an unlicensed, experimental Ebola vaccine from pharmaceutical company Merck arrived in the DRC capital city of Kinshasa. A 2017 paper estimated the vaccines effectiveness in limited trials during the 2014-2016 West Africa Ebola outbreak was 100 percent. Salama said the vaccine would first be given to people in Mbandaka who may have been exposed to the virus.\nFour people died during the previous Ebola outbreak in DRC in 2017.\nSources: BBC, CNN, NPR",

      "Content": "Ireland voted on Friday to overturn the countrys constitutional prohibition on abortion in a national referendum, according to exit poll results. Irelands constitution grants an unborn person the same right to life as a mother. Under this clause of the countrys Eighth Amendment, abortion is illegal in all cases except when a womans life is deemed to be in real and substantial risk due to the pregnancy. \n\nAccording to Irish media outlet RTEs exit polls, the results were 69.4 percent in favor of the repeal, and 30.6 percent against it. Polls were open between 7 a.m. and 10 p.m. local time on Friday. Votes will be officially counted on Saturday and a final result is expected Sunday. \nIf the official results confirm a repeal of the Eighth Amendment, the vote would remove the constitutional restriction on abortion, but not automatically legalize abortion. Lawmakers in the Irish parliament, called the Oireachtas ireann, would need to draft and vote on new legislative guidelines regulating abortion to make it legal under certain conditions. \nA current draft of legislation has proposed permitting abortion within the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, or after the 12-week mark in cases where doctors determine the womens health is at risk. If the country votes no on the referendum, the current law would remain in place. \nPrime Minister Leo Varadkar, who publicly supported the repeal, called the referendum a once-in-a-generation decision. The last referendum on the issue was 35 years ago. \nAbortion law background\nAfter a referendum in 1983, Ireland changed its constitution to grant an unborn the same right to life as a mother. Article 40.3.3 of the Constitution says, The State acknowledges the right to life of the unborn and, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother, guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate that right. \nA high court ruled in 1986 that providing women with information about getting abortions outside of Ireland was unconstitutional, breaching the fetus equal right to life. The Supreme Court reaffirmed this decision in 1988. \nIn 1992, Irelands Supreme Court ruled that a person should be permitted to travel outside the country to receive an abortion in cases where the pregnancy presents a real and substantial risk to a mothers life, though this doesnt apply with non-fatal health issues. The ruling overturned a High Court decision that restricted the freedom of movement of a 14-year-old girl who had been raped by a neighbor and attempted to travel to Britain to have an abortion. She was deemed a suicide risk. The attorney general at the time sought the injunction against the girls travel. \nIn 1995, Ireland passed the Regulation of Information (Services Outside the State For Termination of Pregnancies) Act, which outlined conditions under which information could be distributed to individuals or groups about abortion services that are available outside of Ireland. The Act did not require medical professionals to distribute information on foreign abortion services.\nIn 2013, the country passed the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act (PLDPA), which allowed abortion in cases in which at least two doctors consider there to be a real and substantial risk of loss of the womans life from a physical illness or suicide and in which that risk can only be averted by terminating the pregnancy.\nThe act was passed after the 2012 death of a 31-year-old woman, Savita Halappanavar, whose doctors declined to give her an abortion. Halappanavar, an Indian woman in Ireland, went to the hospital 17-weeks pregnant. Her doctors determined a miscarriage was inevitable, yet did not terminate the pregnancy. She died a few days later due to sepsis, a blood infection, and her husband claimed she may have lived if an abortion had been performed. \nCatholic population\nAbout 78.3 percent of the approximately 4.75 million Irish citizens self-identified as Roman Catholic, according to a 2016 Census. That represents a decline of 5.9 percent since 2011, and a total decline of 13.3 percent in the past 25 years, according to census results. \nPope Francis is scheduled to visit Ireland in August, the first time a pope will have visited there since 1979. In 2015, Pope Francis announced that all Catholic priests would be able to forgive the sin of abortion during the jubilee year, also known as the Holy Year or the Year of Mercy, from December 2015 to November 2016. In the Catholic Church, the sin of abortion is punishable by excommunication and in most countries the punishment can only be overturned by a bishop. In some countries, including Britain, Canada, Scotland and the U.S., bishops have delegated authority to priests to absolve the sin.\nThe Catholic Catechism states that human life is sacred and must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception. \nIrish referendums on other social issues\nIreland has previously decided the legality of other social issues by referendum. In 1995, Ireland voted 50.3 to 49.8 percent in favor of legalizing divorce. At the time it was the only European nation where divorce was illegal. \nIn 2015, Ireland became the first country to legalize same-sex marriage, after a 62 to 38 percent vote in a referendum. \n\nSources: BBC, Catholic News, Citizens Information, CNN, Constitution, Faith Survey, Irish Central, Reuters, National Catholic Reporter, PLDPA, Regulation of Information Act, The Irish Times, The Irish Times, The Guardian, The Guardian, The Washington Post, The Washington Post, Vatican, World Bank",

      "Content": "Brazils highest court ruled on Thursday that former President Luiz Incio Lula da Silva would not be allowed to remain free while he appeals his 12-year sentence for corruption. The Supreme Federal Tribunal ruled 6-5 based on a 2016 lower court ruling that defendants could be jailed after one failed appeal, BBC reported. Lulas sentence was increased from 9 1/2 years to 12 years during a first failed appeal in January.Lula has denied wrongdoing.\nAfter the ruling, Brazilian federal judge Sergio Moro ordered Lula to turn himself in by 5 p.m. local time Friday, Moros press office said. He can still appeal the case on procedural grounds.\nLula said the corruption case was politically motivated. He has previously announced his intention to run in the upcoming October presidential elections, though he has not officially registered as a candidate. A 2010 Brazilian law prohibits those convicted of crimes that arent overturned through an appeal from running for office for a minimum of eight years, according to BBC. Exceptions have been made to the law in the past, according to BBC. The Superior Electoral Court could decide to make such an exception if Lula registers as a presidential candidate before the Aug. 15 deadline.\nLula was convicted of corruption and money laundering in July of last year. The charges were for receiving an apartment and favors worth $1.1 million from a construction company that allegedly received contracts from state-run oil company Petrobras in return. Lula's lawyers said it was never proven that he was the owner of the apartment. They also said some of the testimony against Lula came from the former chairman of the construction company, who has been convicted of corruption. \nThe case is related to Operation Car Wash, initiated in 2014 to investigate allegations that Petrobras awarded contracts based on bribes.\nThere have been protests in Brazil, both for and against Lula. After the ruling, Lulas Workers Party said it was a tragic day for democracy in Brazil.\nLula, 72, was president of Brazil from 2003 to 2011.\nSources: BBC, NPR",

      "Content": "Have you read news coverage of the net neutrality issue and then still wondered what it is exactly? If so, youre not alone. Below, we provide an overview of the concept and arguments for an against it.\nWhat is net neutrality?\nNet neutrality refers to the concept that internet service providers (ISPs) should treat all data on the internet equally. The U.S. has had regulations in place on net neutrality since 2015. \nWhat does this mean? Data on the internet travels through ISPs (such as Verizon or Comcast) to consumers who purchase their internet service. Some activity on the internet, such as streaming videos, require more data usage than other types, such as email or surfing the web. With net neutrality in place, the ISPs cannot slow down or block delivery of larger file types, or charge more for them. \nThe ISPs also cannot discriminate either for or against certain content providers, under net neutrality rules. For example, if an ISP company has its own video streaming service, it could not offer that service for free while charging additional money to stream from independent companies such as Netflix or Hulu. \nWithout net neutrality in place, ISPs would be allowed to charge more for certain types of services, or tiers of data usage. They could offer cheaper plans for people who, for instance, only want to access email and a browser, and more for people who stream videos or upload content. \nWhat net neutrality isnt\nNet neutrality refers to the type of data and does not directly relate to the messages within that data. In other words, if there was no net neutrality, an ISP could block, charge more for or slow down video files compared to text files, but not take action based on whats in those videos. ISPs would not be allowed to prioritize or disfavor political content, by, for instance, slowing down or charging more for content associated with a particular political party or ideology. (Note that some people argue that content could be indirectly influenced if ISPs are allowed to prioritize certain file types or content from companies owned by the ISPs.)\nIf there were no net neutrality and there were tiered internet service plans, theoretically people who paid for the highest tiers could access any content available online without slowdowns or blocks. \nWhat are some arguments in favor of net neutrality?\nThe main arguments for the government enforcing net neutrality have to do with counteracting large ISPs monopolies on the market, the promotion of tech entrepreneurship, and the promotion of equal access to information.\nSince most people use the internet in many aspects of their lives, it is deemed an essential service. As the argument goes, because there are only a few large ISP companies to choose from, they have a lot of power to set and control prices. If there were no net neutrality, ISPs could create financial barriers for people to access types of internet content. They could also create zero rating plans that offer free sponsored content, influencing what people of limited means can access.\nSome argue that this could discourage tech entrepreneurship by discriminating against companies that dont have the resources to enter into deals with the ISPs to have their content prioritized. In other words, in an extreme case a new tech company could launch but very few people would have access to it.\nAdditionally, some argue that limited access to certain types of content could affect educational opportunities for lower-income people. Educational and training videos are often currently available on the internet for free, and people argue this can help narrow the education gap.\nWhat are some arguments against net neutrality?\nThe main arguments against net neutrality tend to center around either free market solutions (anti-regulation), its effect on investment, fair pay-for-use pricing, or the concept of a sponsor-subsidized internet to increase access to those with fewer economic means.\nFirst, some people argue that there should be minimal government regulation of industries like tech in general. The assumption here is that the market regulates itself and encourages the most competitive pricing models. If a company overcharges, as long as there is some alternative, its business will suffer and it will be forced to reduce prices. \nOthers argue that the U.S. government is too powerful and its oversight of the publics consumption of internet content should be limited. (For instance, Glenn Greenwald alleges that the government already interferes with the manufacture of internet routers exported to China to install tools for spying.) \nSome net neutrality opponents, including FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, argue that net neutrality discourages ISPs from investing in their networks or their own services like video streaming.\nSome people also suggest it is fairer to have people pay for what they use. If a person downloads or uploads Gigabytes worth of data and uses more of the ISPs bandwidth than a typical user, the argument is they should pay more. This would be similar to a person who uses more electricity and therefore has a higher bill than neighbors who use less.\nFinally, an IEEE paper concluded that tiered pricing with sponsor-subsidized options could increase access for those with fewer economic resources and bridge the digital divide between users who can easily afford the cost of mobile data and those who cannot.\n*Disclaimer: This is an overview of arguments for and against net neutrality, and is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all considerations. This is also not intended to comment on the validity or legitimacy of the various arguments for or against net neutrality. \n\nSources: Deadline, Forbes, Forbes, Mashable, Sponsoring Mobile Data, TechCrunch, The New York Times, Quora, Quora.

      "Content": "On Monday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with the European Unions Foreign Affairs Council in Brussels. During the meeting, he called for EU leaders to recognize Jerusalem as Israels capital, and to support a U.S. peace plan between Israel and the Palestinians. EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Federica Mogherini said the bloc remains committed to a two-state solution for Israel and the Palestinians with Jerusalem as the capital of both.\nNetanyahus request follows a Dec. 6 announcement by U.S. President Donald Trump, in which he said the U.S. would recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and move its embassy there from Tel Aviv. The Palestinian National Authority, Russian President Vladimir Putin, Jordanian King Abdullah II and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan have voiced criticisms of the decision.\nEuropean lawmakers have declined to move their embassies to Jerusalem, or to support a U.S. peace plan without knowing the details of it. Czech Foreign Minister, Lubomir Zaoralek said Monday, I am convinced that is it impossible to ease tension with a unilateral solution. French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said the EU would not write a blank cheque for an unseen peace plan, according to The Guardian.\nDuring his meeting with EU foreign ministers, Netanyahu said the U.S. decision to recognize Jerusalem would make peace in the Middle East possible, because recognizing reality is the substance of peace, the foundation of peace.\nSources: The Guardian, The New York Times",

The recommendation will now go to Attorney General Avihai Mendelblit for review, who will decide whether to file charges. Netanyahu can remain in office during the review; he has denied the allegations.\nIn a televised address Netanyahu said he would remain Israels leader as long as its citizens continue to elect him.\nFile 1000 includes allegations that Netanyahu accepted gifts, such as cigars and champagne, worth about $285,000 in total from Arnon Milchan and James Packer. Milchan is an Israeli Hollywood film producer and Packer is an Australian businessman. Police said in return, Netanyahu allegedly provided assistance with visa matters and suggested legislation that would exempt Israelis returning from abroad from paying taxes for 10 years. The finance ministry eventually rejected this proposal.\nFile 2000 alleges that Netanyahu asked for positive coverage from an Israeli newspaper in return for supporting legislation that would disadvantage one of its competitors.\nNetanyahu, 68, became prime minister in 2009 and previously served in the role between 1996 and 1999. \nSources: AP, BBC",

      "Content": "An election for state and local government offices was held in the U.S. on November 7, andin order to put this week's elections in context, here we explainhow state governments are structured, and how they relate to the federal government.\nOverall structure\nEach state has its own constitution and governmental hierarchy. State governments are structured in the same way as the federal government, with executive, legislative and judicial branches. The number of elected positions in each branch may vary by state and population. Rules regarding minimum age requirements for elected positions, citizenship and residency requirements, or term limits may also vary by state.\nGenerally, states must abide by federal law. Although federal law supercedes state law, states may enact laws that differ or are counter to federal laws, executive orders or other federal guidelines. In such cases, the federal judiciary may take action against the state. \nState executive branch\nThe state governor is elected by the states voters to lead the executive branch. Depending on the state, people may also elect other members of the executive branch, such as the lieutenant governor, attorney general, secretary of state, and auditors and commissioners. The state executive branch typically works independently from the federal executive branch. However, the governor may request that the president declare a federal emergency to allow the state to receive federal funding.\n\n\tGovernor: As the chief executive officer of the state, governors are responsible for implementing state laws and overseeing state executive branch operations. Governors can promote legislative proposals, enact executive orders and veto state legislation. Most state governors can appoint judges. All states except Oregon allow for the impeachment of governors.\n\tLieutenant Governor: This is the second-highest executive office in a state and the lieutenant governor serves as governor if the governor is temporarily absent or removed from office. The positions other powers may vary by state. In Hawaii and New Jersey, the lieutenant governor also serves as the secretary of state.\n\tSecretary of State (also called Secretary of the Commonwealth): Most states have this position in their executive branch; Alaska, Hawaii and Utah do not. Duties vary by state, but may include recordkeeping, the monitoring of elections and registering businesses.\n\tAttorney General: All 50 states have this position. The Attorney General serves as the chief legal advisor and chief law enforcement officer for the state government, and represents the state in legal matters.\n\tTreasurer: This position handles state finances. Some states may refer to this position as controller. In other states, the treasurer may handle certain duties of the comptroller or auditor (see definitions below).\n\tAuditor: In 48 states, the person in this position manages accounting and financial functions of the state. The state auditor can also audit other state departments and investigate fraud allegations. In some states this position may be considered part of the legislative branch rather than the executive branch.\n\tSuperintendent: Other names for this position include superintendent of education, superintendent of public instruction or chief school administrator. This person oversees the state's elementary and secondary schools.\n\tInsurance Commissioner: All 50 states have an insurance commissioner that is either appointed or elected. The commissioner regulates state insurance and may include consumer protection duties.\n\tComptroller: Also sometimes referred to as controller, the position may include duties similar to those of the treasurer, such as managing the budget.\n\tAgriculture Commissioner: This person manages the states agricultural department and enforces state agricultural regulations.\n\tNatural Resource Commissioner: The commissioner, in general, maintains and regulates the states natural resources, such as state parks, forests and recreation areas.\n\tLabor Commissioner: This person typically makes sure that state labor and workforce laws arent being violated.\n\tPublic Service Commissioner: The public service commissioner regulates utility services such as energy, telecommunications and water.\n\nState legislative branch\nLocally elected representatives make up a states legislative branch. Legislative duties include creating state legislation (from matters raised by the governor or by members of the state congress), approving the states budget and issuing articles of impeachment. Except for Nebraska, all states have an upper chamber (the Senate) and a lower chamber (the House of Representatives). Senate legislators typically serve longer terms than House legislators. The lower chamber may also be called the House of Delegates or General Assembly. Legislators are elected from districts throughout the state. The number of legislators elected to each chamber varies by state.\nNote: People who serve in a states Senate and House are separate from those who represent the state in the U.S. Congress. In the U.S. Senate, for example, each state has two senators representing the state, which equals a total of 100 U.S. senators in Congress. The number of U.S. House Representatives per state varies by population. The U.S. House currently has a maximum of 435 representatives.\nState judicial branch\nThe state judicial branch is the states court system. The judicial branch is led by the state supreme court, which hears appeals from lower-level state courts. Since state legislators can determine a states court structure, the number of courts and the number of elected judges may vary by state. A state supreme court ruling is typically binding, unless the ruling is appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.\nLocal governments\nLocal governments can also vary by state. Some states may have local representation for counties, boroughs, parishes, municipalities, cities, towns, villages or townships. They are usually responsible for regulating parks services, police and fire departments, housing services, emergency medical services, municipal courts, transportation services (such as buses and road maintenance) and waste removal.",

Armenian President Armen Sarkissian signed the decree appointing Pashinyan, who leads the Civil Contract party and its coalition partners, to the position.\nThe election took place almost a week after the Armenian parliament initially voted to reject Pashinyans candidacy for prime minister. He called for demonstrations, and more than 30,000 people protested, blocking some transport routes to the capital of Yerevan and its airport. \nFormer Prime Minister Serzh Sargsyan resigned two weeks ago following earlier protests calling for his resignation. Pashinyan had called for those protests, saying Sargsyan lacks legitimacy. Pashinyan was then arrested and subsequently released.\nSargsyan had served as president for two five-year terms prior to the parliament voting him into the role of prime minister on April 17, before resigning on April 23. In 2015, Armenia voted to change its constitution to grant some of the roles of the president to the prime minister. Sargsyans Republican party holds a majority in parliament. \nRussian President Vladimir Putin congratulated Pashinyan on the election result. Pashinyan has said he would maintain current relations with Moscow. Armenia was formerly part of the Soviet Union. \nPashinyans plans \nAfter the vote, Pashinyan announced that on May 9 he would visit Nagorno-Karabakh, a region of Azerbaijan under the control of ethnic Armenian forces since a six-year war ended in 1994. The new prime minister said the regions self-declared government there must be a part of any talks to end the conflict. Pashinyan, in a speech to parliament before his election Tuesday, said his protest movement would lead to the recognition of realizing the rights of Karabakh to self-determination. \nAzerbaijani Foreign Ministry spokesman Hikmet Hajiyev issued a statement saying the Nagorno-Karabakh region, which is currently occupied, has always been an integral part of Azerbaijan. \nSources: AP, NPR",

      "Content": "On Tuesday, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration for adding a citizenship question to the 2020 U.S. Census. The Department of Commerce had announced plans to add a question asking about the respondents' citizenships to the upcoming census the day before Becerras announcement. \nAccording to Becerras announcement, the question violates Article I, section 2 of the Constitution, which requires the actual Enumeration of all people in each state. He argues that the question may discourage both legal and undocumented immigrants from participating, potentially misrepresenting the number of California residents.\nIn December, the Department of Justice had requested the citizenship question be added back in to the census in order to provide census block level citizenship voting age population (CVAP) data that is not currently available from government surveys, according to the Commerce Department. CVAP figures include data on the citizenship and race of the voting age population.\nU.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said the information would help to enforce the Voting Rights Act, which protects minority voting rights and prohibits the use of potentially discriminatory voting measures, such as literacy tests. Ross concluded that obtaining complete and accurate information to meet this legitimate government purpose outweighed the limited potential adverse impacts.\nNew York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman announced plans to lead a multi-state lawsuit to block the Department of Commerces decision. His office plans to file the suit and announce the other cities and states involved, after the Department of Commerce submits its report to Congress on Saturday, according to Reuters. \nFormer U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder also said he would sue the administration to block the question from the census, on behalf of the National Democratic Redistricting Committee.\nLast week, Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.) introduced legislation that would prohibit the commerce secretary from making major changes to the census before such changes have been researched and tested. The bill has nine Democratic and no Republican co-sponsors.\nThe Census Act of 1954 states that the Census Bureau must give Congress the opportunity to review the proposed subjects within three years, and the questions within two years, prior to the next decennial census.\nThe U.S. Census\nRequired by the U.S. Constitution, the census is distributed by the U.S. Census Bureau to residents every 10 years. The data is used to allocate federal funding for schools, hospitals, infrastructure and other local services. It is also used to determine the number of congressional seats each state needs for adequate government representation. According to the Department of Commerce, a citizenship question was included in the census between 1820 and 1950.\nThe census is distributed by mail and by workers who go door-to-door to gather responses. According to AP, about 74 percent of households responded to the mail-in census forms in 2010. \nSources: USA Today, AP, Reuters",

      "Content": "National Football League (NFL) Commissioner Roger Goodell announced on Wednesday that owners had approved a rule that would fine teams if their players on the field do not stand for the national anthem. The new policy also allows players to remain in the locker room during the anthem, in lieu of standing.\nOf the owners who voted, the decision was unanimous. San Francisco 49ers owner Jed York said he abstained from voting.\nBackground\nBeginning in 2016 and continuing during the 2017 season, some NFL players did not stand during the playing of the U.S. national anthem. San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick was the first to sit, and then kneel during the anthem. He said he did not want to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color. (For more background, see our context sectionhere.)\nLast September, President Donald Trump tweeted, Sports fans should never condone players that do not stand proud for their National Anthem or their Country. NFL should change policy! He also said players who did not stand should be fired.\nThe policy\nPrior to the ruling, the NFLs game operations manual said players were required to be on the field and that they should stand for the anthem, since 2009. The league did not previously have codified penalties against players not standing. The new policy will remove the requirement that players be on the field while the anthem is played. \nUnder the new policy, individual teams could discipline their players for not standing for the pre-game anthem. The NFLs statement on the new rules also said, the Commissioner will impose appropriate discipline on league personnel who do not stand and show respect for the flag and the Anthem. \nThe statement did not define what it meant by show respect. Goodell said the NFLs policy included standing at attention, hats off and focused. Pittsburgh Steelers owner Art Rooney he would consider raising a fist or linking arms during the anthem, which players have done, as an example of not showing respect. \nGoodell said, The efforts by many of our players sparked awareness and action around issues of social justice that must be addressed. He also said, We are honored to work with our players to drive progress.\nIt was unfortunate that on-field protests created a false perception among many that thousands of NFL players were unpatriotic. This is not and was never the case, Goodell said. \nPlayers association response\nThe NFL Players Association (NFLPA) said it would review the policy and challenge any aspect of it that is inconsistent with the collective bargaining agreement. It also said: \n\nThe NFL chose to not consult the union in the development of this new policy. NFL players have shown their patriotism through their social activism, their community service, in support of our military and law enforcement and yes, through their protests to raise awareness about the issues they care about. \n\nThe NFL owners met and discussed the issue for two hours on Tuesday and another hour on Wednesday before voting. The NFLPA was not present at those meetings. Goodell said he met with players over the past year to discuss the issue. \nWeve talked to tens if not hundreds of players about this over the last year or so to get their input, to understand their position and, again, to respect them as I think weve stated here, Goodell said.\nThis week, the NFL agreed with players to put $89 million towards national and local social justice projects over the next seven years to address some of the underlying issues behind the anthem protests, according to Mark Murphy, the Green Bay Packers president.\nSources: AP, CNN, ESPN, ESPN, Fox News, NFL, NFL, The New York Times",

      "Content": "German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Interior Minister Horst Seehofer, two leaders of the governments grand coalition, agreed to a new migration policy on Monday. According to German news outlet Deutsche Welle (DW), the plan still needs to be approved by the grand coalitions third party, the Social Democrats (SPD), and the government of Austria before it can be implemented.\nGermanys governing grand coalition includes three political parties: Merkels Christian Democratic Union (CDU), Seehofers Christian Social Union (CSU) and the SPD, which is led by Andrea Nahles.\nAfter multiple days of negotiation, Merkel said they had reached a good compromise. Seehofer said the agreement was sustainable and matched his convictions, and had allowed him to remain head of the Interior Ministry.\nThe tentative plan includes:\n\n\tRejecting asylum seekers at the German-Austrian border if they are registered in another EU country\n\tCreating transit centers at the border to expedite deportations\n\tA bilateral deal with Austria that has yet to be drafted on how to handle EU countries that refuse to take back asylum seekers; the announcement didnt include specifics\n\nSPD party leader Andrea Nahles said there was still a lot that needs to be discussed. SPD members have spoken against transit centers, which SPD migrant expert Aziz Bozkurt described as migrant camps.\nPeter Beyer, a member of parliament and the CDUs official commissioner for transatlantic relations, told CNBC he felt the SPD would agree to the deal, but of course now it needs a lot of negotiation with our neighboring countries, with our partners within the European Union and then what has been negotiated will then have to be implemented.\nAccording to DW, Austria said it was prepared to take unspecified measures to protect the countrys southern borders with Italy and Slovenia. Should this agreement become the German government's position, we see that as prompting us to take action to prevent negative consequences for Austria and its population,\" Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said in a joint statement with his vice chancellor, Heinz-Christian Strache, and interior minister, Herbert Kickl.\nEuropean Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said of the deal: I have not studied it in detail but at first glance  and I have asked the legal services to look at it  it seems to me to be legally compliant.\nSources: CNBC, Deutsche Welle, Deutsche Welle",

      "Content": "Brett Kavanaughs confirmation vote by the Senate Judiciary Committee on his nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court has not yet been scheduled, after delays following an accusation of sexual misconduct in high school. \nPsychology professor Christine Blasey Ford has alleged that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her at a house party when they were both teenagers. Both attended high school in Maryland, where she attended an all-girls and Kavanaugh attended an all-boys school. Kavanaugh denies the allegation. \nFord had initially sent a private letter about the alleged incident to Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and requested it not be made public. The senator forwarded the letter to the F.B.I., and Ford later came forward publicly. The Senate Judiciary Committee has delayed a vote on Kavanaughs confirmation. Both Ford, through her lawyer, and Kavanaugh had said they would testify before the committee on the matter. \nOn Saturday, Fords lawyers confirmed to the committee that Ford accepted a request to testify. Dr. Ford accepts the Committee's request to provide her first-hand knowledge of Brett Kavanaugh's sexual misconduct next week, the lawyers said. The date for the testimony was tentatively scheduled for Thursday, Sept. 27. \nFord, Kavanaugh and Kavanaughs wife have all received violent threats over the allegations; the F.B.I is investigating the threats. \nMaryland does not have a statute of limitations on felony sexual offense criminal cases, which would include attempted rape. \nTimeline \n1982: Ford and Kavanaugh were 15 and 17 years old, respectively, and attended different Maryland high schools. Ford later alleged that while at a house party they both attended, Kavanaugh was intoxicated, pushed her into a bedroom, locked the door, tried to grope her, tried to remove her clothes, and put his hand over her mouth while a male friend of Kavanaugh was in the room. Ford said the friend was laughing. Ford said she was able to leave the room after the friend jumped on top of them, and Kavanaugh and the friend fought. She later tells the media that she did not tell anyone about the incident at the time. Kavanaugh and the male friend deny the incident. \n2012: Ford discusses the incident in couples therapy with her husband, according to a therapists notes Ford later provides to The Washington Post. Ford said she mentioned Kavanaughs name; the notes do not include a name. A therapists notes from the following year with a session with Ford mention a rape attempt.\nJuly 9, 2018: President Trump nominates Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court to replace retiring Justice Anthony Kennedy. \nLate July: Ford sends a letter to Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) detailing the allegation, and asking to keep the matter confidential.\nEarly August: Ford takes a polygraph test administered by a former FBI agent, on the advice of her lawyer. The polygraph test does not show her to be lying about her recollection. (The Supreme Court will not accept polygraph tests as evidence due to inconclusive evidence of their validity, but the tests are sometimes used by law enforcement during the investigation process, according to the American Psychological Association.)\nSept. 4-7: The Senate Judiciary Committee holds hearings on Kavanaughs potential confirmation to the Supreme Court. \nSept. 12: The Intercept reports that Feinstein has the letter about the allegation against Kavanaugh and would not share it with other senators. The following day, Feinstein says she referred the matter to law enforcement.\nSept. 14: The New Yorker reports on the allegations without naming Ford, followed by other media outlets. Kavanaugh categorically and unequivocally denies the allegation in a statement issued by the White House. Senate Republicans release a letter from 65 women who says they knew Kavanaugh while he was in high school, claiming he behaved honorably.\nSept. 16: The Washington Post publishes an article about the allegations in which Ford agrees to be publicly named for the first time. \nSept. 17: Fords lawyer says her client would be willing to speak publicly to the Senate Judiciary Committee. Kavanaugh also says he would be willing to testify before the committee about the matter.\nTrump says regarding the confirmation process, if it takes a little delay, itll take a little delay. Ten Democrat senators on the Senate Judiciary Committee say the FBI should investigate the matter before they vote. The panel postpones a vote on Kavanaugh that was scheduled for Sept. 20. \nSept. 18: Former students at Fords high school who knew her release a letter attesting to her her honesty, integrity, and intelligence.\nSept. 19: Fords lawyer tells The New York Times that due to the number of death threats her client has received, she has relocated out of her home. Multiple media sources later report on threats received by Ford, Kavanaugh and Kavanaughs wife. \nSept. 20: The media reports on a letter to the committee from Fords lawyer. In it, she repeats that Ford would be willing to testify to the committee next week if it is done under fair conditions that ensure her safety. \nSept. 21: Fords lawyers discuss conditions for Fords potential testimony before the committee, including a request that Kavanaugh not be present in the room when she is, that the other boy who Ford says was in the room be subpoenaed, and that Kavanaugh be questioned before Ford to not be influenced by her testimony. \nFords lawyer requests the testimony not be before Thursday, Sept. 27. Senate Republicans suggest that Ford testify on Wednesday, Sept. 26, with some requesting Monday, Sept. 24. \nKavanaugh has not requested specific conditions for his testimony. \nAlso on Sept. 21, Trump releases a series of tweets about the allegations (here, here, here, here and here), including saying that if the attack on Dr. Ford was as bad as she says, charges would have been immediately filed with local Law Enforcement Authorities by either her or her loving parents. He also accused Democrats of obstructing the confirmation process by waiting until after hearings to release the letter. \nSept. 22: Fords lawyers send a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee saying Ford accepts the Committees request to provide her first-hand knowledge of Brett Kavanaugh's sexual misconduct next week. The date is reportedly set for Sept. 27. \n\n\nSources: APA, CBS News, CNN, CNN, CNN, Fox News, Fox News, Legal Match, NBC News, Senate Judiciary - Letter, The Intercept, The New Yorker, The New York Times, The Washington Post, USA Today, USA Today",

      "Content": "Homosexuality is treated quite differently throughout the world. In more than one-third of countries, homosexual sex acts are criminal (and in about 4 percent of countries, they are punishable by death). Conversely, in just over one-quarter of the worlds countries, same-sex marriage or civil partnerships are legal. And in between the two extremes lies a wide array of other forms of discrimination and protection.\nLegislation regarding same-sex relations has changed significantly over the centuries. In 1791, France became the first country to decriminalize same-sex sexual acts between consenting adults with the adoption of a new penal code, which also applied to many of its colonized countries.\nA number of countries decriminalized same-sex sexual acts throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. Some countries also formally criminalized same-sex relations in their penal codes during that period.\nIn the 21st century, the Netherlands became the first country to formally legalize same-sex marriage in 2000, with the legislation going into effect in 2001. The country was followed by Belgium, Canada and Spain over the next few years. The U.S. joined them in 2015 with a Supreme Court decision legalizing same-sex marriage throughout the country. Last year, Australia, Germany and the European island country of Malta all legalized same-sex partnerships or civil unions. \nSame-sex marriage is legal in 22 countries, according to a 2017 International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association (ILGA) report. Additionally, another 28 allow for a legal civil partnership or civil union of same-sex couples  some offering the same rights as in marriages. (Of these 50 countries, 26 also allow for joint adoption of children by same-sex couples.)\nCriminalization, legality and protections around the globe\n\nDeath penalty for same-sex acts (including in only specific areas)\nSame-sex sexual acts are illegal\nDiscriminatory laws against homosexual people or LGBT organizations\nSome discrimination or prohibition, some protections\nNeither notable legal protections nor criminalization\nLegal protections against discrimination\nSame-sex marriage or civil unions are legal\nBreakdown of categories\n Death penalty for same-sex acts \nThese countries have laws allowing for capital punishment for same-sex sexual acts, and known cases of executions. In some of the countries, the death penalty for same-sex sexual acts is only applicable in certain regions.\n Same-sex sexual acts are illegal\nLaws in these countries criminalize same-sex sex acts, either for men or both men and women. Penalties for convictions on these offenses can include months or years in prison. A few of these countries also have the death penalty on the books, but do not enforce it.\n Discriminatory laws against homosexual people or LGBT organizations\nWhile same-sex relations are not specifically criminal in these countries, they have discriminatory laws against either homosexual people or LGBT organizations. For example, laws may prohibit public displays of affection by same-sex couples, disallow NGOs that advocate for same-sex rights, or other forms of discrimination.\nSome discrimination or prohibition, some protections\nThere is both protection and discrimination in these countries. For example, in Botswana, same-sex sexual acts for both men and women are illegal under the 1964 Penal Code, yet there is also a 2010 law prohibiting employment discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. \nNeither notable legal protections nor criminalization\nNone of these countries have laws that criminalize same-sex sexual behavior. They also do not have laws expressly protecting rights of homosexual people.\n Legal protections against discrimination\nThese countries have explicit laws prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexuality  either equal rights guarantees in their constitutions, anti-hate crime laws, anti-discrimination laws for employment, or other protections.\n Same-sex marriage or civil unions legal\nIn addition to having other legal protections for people on the basis or sexual orientation, these countries have legalized either same sex-marriage or same-sex civil partnerships.\nCriminalization of same-sex sexual acts\nAs of last year, there were 72 countries where same-sex sexual acts between consenting adults were criminal, either for only men (27) or both men and women (45). Thats equivalent to roughly 37 percent of the countries in the world. In 2018, Indias Supreme Court overturned the law prohibiting consensual, adult same-sex relations, reducing the number of countries to 71. \nThe language of the laws that prohibit sexual acts between members of the same sex vary throughout the world: some prohibit any sexual act, some sodomy (anal sex), some buggery (anal or oral sex), some prohibit acts against nature, or use other wording. Globally, punishment for such offenses can vary from public lashings to prison time, and in some cases include capital punishment.\nOf the 72 countries where same-sex sex acts are illegal, eight also carry out capital punishment for same-sex sexual intercourse in at least some areas. The countries are Iran, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Sudan, specific provinces of Somalia and Nigeria, as well as areas of Iraq and Syria controlled by the Islamic State.\nAdditionally, five other countries (Afghanistan, Pakistan, Mauritania, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates) have laws that technically allow for capital punishment for same-sex sexual acts, but are not believed to have carried out official executions in relation to these laws in recent decades, the ILGA reported. In the Asian country of Brunei Darussalam, a proposed law would allow for the death penalty for same-sex sexual acts; the legislation has not been finalized.\nLegal discrimination\nLegal discrimination can come in different forms  from restrictions on assembly to banning public expression of homosexual acts of identity (such as pride parades or holding hands between same-sex partners) to denying organizations that advocate for LGBT rights NGO status.\nIn Russia, for instance, while same-sex sexual acts were decriminalized in 1993, various promotion or morality laws prohibit expression of homosexual identity or advocacy work. A law prohibiting the Promotion of Non-Traditional Sexual Relations Among Minors was used to prosecute members of a St. Petersburg-based LGBT youth organization. Certain expressions of homosexual activity in public are punishable by jail time. Russia also drafted a U.N. resolution to deny benefits to same-sex partners of U.N. staff members.\nLegal protections\nMore than one-third of the countries in the world have some explicit legal protections for homosexual people, according to data from ILGA.\nNine countries explicitly prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in their constitutions. For example, Mexicos constitution prohibits discrimination based on sexual preferences. In other countries, such as Canada, while the constitutions wording does not explicitly mention sexual orientation, case law has established that equal rights and protections apply on this basis.\nIn September 2018, Indias Supreme Court ruled that all constitutional protections should apply to homosexual people and that discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation is illegal. The decision overturned a law that banned same-sex sexual acts.\nGlobally, in 2017, there were laws prohibiting certain workplace discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in 72 U.N. member states, as well as in Taiwan. \nAdditionally, 43 countries in 2017 had laws against hate crimes that target people on the basis of sexual identity, and 39 countries had laws banning actions that incite hate towards homosexual people.\nNon-legal forms of violence and discrimination\nLegality is one thing, but discrimination and violence can come outside of the dictates of law. In the extreme, this can include extrajudicial killings and other hate crimes against people who are homosexual or perceived to be homosexual.\nIn Russia, aside from the discriminatory laws mentioned above, extrajudicial discriminations and violence have been reported. In 2017, a Russian newspaper reported that authorities engaged in extrajudicial imprisonment and torture of at least 100 men believed to be homosexual in Chechnya, in southern Russia. One anonymous Chechen man who was allegedly detained illegally told CNN in an interview that he was beaten and electrocuted.\nThe Russian news report alleged that the authorities illegally executed 27 of the men one night. Apart from authorities engaging in violence, civilians in the area have engaged in hate crimes against those believes to be homosexuals. One Chechen man told CNN that he feared that his family would murder him if they found out he was homosexual.\nIn the U.S., according to the FBIs 2016 hate crime statistics, 16.7 percent of reported hate crimes were committed due to sexual orientation or perceived sexual orientation, totaling 1,255 incidents that year. Hate crimes are crimes that manifest evidence of prejudice based on race, religion, sexual orientation, or ethnicity, according to the definition in a U.S. law, and can include violence against people or property.\nBeyond violence, other types of discrimination or unequal treatment can exist. In countries where homosexuality is legal and there are legal protections against discrimination, some people who are homosexual or perceived to be homosexual report instances of discrimination or harassment at school, in the workplace, in housing opportunities, while in public or while receiving medical care.\nIn the U.K., for example, where same-sex marriage is legal and discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation is illegal, a recent national government survey found that more than a quarter of LGBT respondents experience verbal harassment for their sexuality over the past year. Additionally, 6 percent reported they were physically threatened, and 4 percent said they were physically or sexually assaulted.\n\nSources: Amnesty International, 76Crimes, CNN, ILGA State-sponsored homophobia report, FBI UCR, Sibalis via GLBTQ Archive, HRW Report, The New York Times, UK LGBT Survey, UN OHCHR News, World Atlas",

      "Content": "On Wednesday, British Prime Minister Theresa May announced measures the country would take against Russia, including the expulsion of 23 diplomats, in response to the March 4 poisoning of former Russian agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter. According to British intelligence, the two were poisoned with Novichok, a nerve agent originally created by the Soviet Union, while in Salisbury, England. May said Russia gave no explanation for the presence of Novichok after the U.K. requested such information be provided by midnight Tuesday. Russia denied responsibility for the attack.\nDuring her announcement to parliament, May repeated the governments conclusion that either Russia was directly responsible for the attack or it could have \"lost control\" of the nerve agent, which allowed others access to it. She said, There is no alternative conclusion other than that the Russian State was culpable for the attempted murder of Mr. Skripal and his daughter  and for threatening the lives of other British citizens in Salisbury, including Detective Sergeant Nick Bailey. This represents an unlawful use of force by the Russian State against the United Kingdom.\nThe Russian Embassy to the U.K. issued a statement saying May's measures to \"punish\" Russia were made \"under the false pretext\" of Russia's alleged involvement in the poisoning. The Russian Foreign Ministry also said it had been prepared to cooperate with an investigation under the framework of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, had Britain pursued an investigation there. The statement added that the \"hostile\" measures Britain planned to take were \"unacceptable,\" and that Russia's \"response measures will not be long in coming.\"\nMay said the U.K. had identified 23 Russian diplomats as undeclared intelligence officers and they would be expelled under the terms of the Vienna Convention. She said the diplomats have one week to leave Britain, noting it was the biggest expulsion in over 30 years and that it \"reflects the fact that this is not the first time that the Russian State has acted against\" the U.K.\nPrior to May announcing the measures, Russian President Vladimir Putin said through a spokesman: \"Moscow won't accept absolutely unfounded accusations against it, which are not substantiated by any evidence, and won't accept the language of ultimatum.\"\nIn addition to expelling diplomats, the measures announced by May included:\n\n\trevoking Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrovs invitation to visit the U.K.;\n\tfreezing Russian state assets when evidence indicates they may be used to threaten the life or property of people in the U.K.;\n\tincreasing checks on private flights, customs and freight;\n\tgranting U.K. border agents the authority to detain people suspected of \"hostile state activity,\" not just terrorism;\n\tstrengthen[ing] powers to impose sanctions in response to the violation of human rights\";\n\tMinisters or Royals not visiting Russia for this years FIFA World Cup.\n\nOn Wednesday, U.K. officials met with NATO and the U.N. Security Council to discuss the attack and pus[h] for a robust international response, according to May.\nSources: BBC, The Guardian, The Independent",

      "Content": "A federal judge in Manhattan ruled on Wednesday that it was unconstitutional for President Donald Trump to block users from viewing his @realDonaldTrump Twitter account. The Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University brought the case last July, arguing that Trumps Twitter account is a public forum under the First Amendment. The judge agreed that the account qualified as a public forum and that blocking users violated their First Amendment rights.\nJudge Naomi Reice Buchwald wrote in her ruling, We hold that portions of the @realDonaldTrump account -- the interactive space where Twitter users may directly engage with the content of the President's tweets -- are properly analyzed under the public forum doctrines set forth by the Supreme Court, that such space is a designated public forum, and that the blocking of the plaintiffs based on their political speech constitutes viewpoint discrimination that violates the First Amendment.\nWhile we must recognize, and are sensitive to, the Presidents personal First Amendment rights, he cannot exercise those rights in a way that infringes the corresponding First Amendment rights of those who have criticized him, the judge continued. \nThe Department of Justice had argued that blocked individuals could still access Trumps tweets by not logging in to Twitter. Buchwald ruled that blocking users from interacting directly with Trump on Twitter was a violation of a real, albeit narrow, slice of [free] speech.\nBuchwald also wrote, no government official -- including the President -- is above the law, and all government officials are presumed to follow the law as has been declared.\nThe Knight First Amendment Institute brought the suit against Trump and two of his aides on behalf of seven people whose Twitter accounts had been blocked by the presidents account.\nAt a hearing in March, Buchwald had proposed that the parties settle out of court, suggesting that Trump could mute rather than block people from his account. \nIf someone blocks an account, it makes it so the owner of the blocked account cannot follow the blocker, find tweets sent by him or her when logged into Twitter and searching, or send direct messages to the blocker. If an account is muted, it can still follow and direct message. If a user mutes an account he or she does not follow, he or she will not see replies from that account in any Twitter conversations clicked into and muted accounts tweets will not appear in their Twitter timelines.\nTrumps @realDonaldTrump account currently has 52.2 million followers; his @POTUS account has 23.2 million followers.\nThe ruling does not affect private citizens ability to block Twitter accounts. \nSources: CNN, NBC News",

      "Content": "On Saturday, The New York Times published an article describing a January letter from President Donald Trumps lawyers to Special Counsel Robert Mueller, which responded to a list of questions from the special counsels Russia investigation by saying, we have concluded that your office has already received the answers from the documents and testimony provided by the President, the White House, his staff, the Trump campaign and the Trump organization. The confidential 20-page letter was dated Jan. 29 and authored by John Dowd and Jay Sekulow. \nWith respect to the allegations that Trump may have obstructed justice in the Russia investigation, the letter says Trump by virtue of his position as the chief law enforcement officer, could neither constitutionally nor legally constitute obstruction because that would amount to him obstructing himself, and that he could, if he wished, terminate the inquiry, or even exercise his power to pardon if he so desired.\nThe reference to obstruction of justice may relate to former FBI Director James Comeys account of comments Trump allegedly made in February 2017. One comment alleges former national security advisor Lt. Gen. Mike Flynn. Flynn, who resigned on Feb. 14, 2017, had inadvertently briefed Vice President Mike Pence and others with incomplete information regarding his phone calls with the Russian Ambassador. Trump allegedly told Comey the following day, I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. Media outlets have published articles about whether this, or a December 2017 tweet from Trump, constitutes obstruction of justice. \nThe letter also says Trumps lawyers are guided by the Espy case, that those seeking information from the President must demonstrate with specificity why it is likely that the subpoenaed materials [here, his testimony] contain important evidence and why this evidence, or equivalent evidence, is not practically available from another source. \nThe Espy case refers to Circuit, In re Sealed Case (Espy), 121 F.3d 729 (D.C. Cir. 1997). During the case, an independent counsel prosecuting former Secretary of Agriculture Mike Espy for improperly accepting gifts subpoenaed the White House Counsels investigation into Espy, seeking the White House Counsels notes. Former President Bill Clinton withheld documents, claiming executive privilege. An appeals court ruled the prosecutor could subpoena the notes if they likely contain important evidence and the evidence is not available with due diligence elsewhere.\nDowd and Sekulow also wrote that the President of the United States is not above the law, but just as obvious and equally as true is the fact that the President should not be subjected to strained readings and forced applications of clearly irrelevant statutes. The letter concluded with an offer to receive any further questions and provide you the answers to help you complete your report and resolve any other remaining questions you might have.\nOn Saturday, Trump wrote on Twitter, There was No Collusion with Russia and questioned which party was leaking his letters to the media.\nHarvard Law School professor Jack Goldsmith said the intersection between the obstruction statutes and the president exercising his constitutional power to supervise an investigation in the Justice Department is an open question, according to the Times.\nSources: Jan. 29 Letter, AP, Politico, The New York Times",

The van reportedly traveled over the curb and hit pedestrians on the sidewalk, according to Constable Jenifferjit Sidhu. On Tuesday, Alek Minassian, 25, was charged with 10 counts of murder and 13 counts of attempted murder in connection with the incident. \nThe police were called to Yonge Street and Finch Avenue West at approximately 1:30 p.m. local time, and took the driver into custody about 90 minutes later. \nThe New York Times described video footage from bystanders showing a man standing beside a damaged white rental van being told repeatedly to get down by police. The man yelled, kill me, before being taken into custody.\nSidhu said on Monday the police do not know the cause or reason for the collision. Canadas Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale said the events do not appear to be connected in any way to national security based on the information available at this time, adding that theres not current information that would indicate a change in the risk level to security.\nOn Tuesday, police said the incident appeared to be intentional. Minassian appeared in court to hear the charges against him, and was ordered not to have any contact with the surviving people he allegedly hit. His next court date is scheduled for May 10. \nSources: BBC, CBC, The New York Times",

The attackers have not been identified. \nThe U.S. Africa Command said there were 800 U.S., Somali and Kenyan troops present where the attack took place in Jubaland, about 218 miles (350 km) southwest of the countrys capital city of Mogadishu. The troops were reportedly in the area to set up a permanent combat outpost. \nThe U.S. troops were aiding the Somali government in combating the al-Qaida-affiliated al-Shabab group for control of the Jubaland region.

      "Content": "The U.S. House of Representatives passed a short-term spending bill on Thursday night that, if approved by the Senate and signed into law, would fund the government until Feb. 16. If the bill is not signed by the president before midnight on Friday, a government shutdown is scheduled to go into effect. \nThe joint resolution passed the House 230-197. Sixty votes are needed for approval in the Senate. Republicans hold 51 seats in the Senate, but Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) is not in Congress due to ill health. With his absence, Republicans would need all Republicans and at least 10 Democrats to vote in favor of the measure for it to pass. Three Republican senators have said they would vote against the bill: Mike Rounds (S.D.), Rand Paul (Ky.) and Lindsey Graham (S.C.).\nOther measures were attached to the spending bill that the House approved. It included the repeal of some Affordable Care Act taxes, as well as a six-year extension of the Childrens Health Insurance Program (CHIP). The program provides services to about 9 million children from low-income families. \nSome Democrats had also requested that a congressional replacement for the Deferred Action on Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program be included in the bill; it wasnt. \nThe government has passed three other short-term spending bills since September of last year, two of them in December.\nWhat happens in a government shutdown?\nIf the government were to shutdown, some nonessential government departments would close and employees would be placed on furlough, which means they would not come to work or be paid. Visa and passport processing could be delayed. \nServices deemed essential would continue. These could include food inspections, air traffic control, national security, disaster assistance, prison operations, taxation, electricity production and Social Security. The U.S. Postal Service would continue to deliver mail, according to CNN. \nMilitary services would still operate, though, The Washington Post reported, service members would not be paid unless Congress passed a special measure for them.\nDuring past shutdowns, national parks and monuments have closed at least partially. U.S. Department of the Interior spokeswoman Heather Swift said that if a shutdown occurs, the department would allow limited access wherever possible to national parks, adding that war memorials and open-air parks in Washington, D.C., would remain open to the public.\nThe last government shutdown occurred in 2013 and lasted for 16 days. The Washington Post reports that about 800,000 government workers were furloughed at the time. That shutdown occurred as Republicans lobbied for changes to the Affordable Care Act, which were not granted.\nSources: AP, BBC, CNN, Fox News, The Washington Post, The Washington Post, The New York Times",

      "Content": "The owner of a non-profit company that makes designs for 3D-printed firearms began selling gun plans on Tuesday, a day after a federal judge in Seattle extended a preliminary injunction temporarily blocking the company from uploading the plans online. Cody Wilson, who runs the Texas-based non-profit Defense Distributed, argued the judges order blocks the company from giving the plans away for free, but not from selling them.\nAnyone who wants these files is going to get them. I'm gonna sell it to them, I'm gonna ship them, Wilson said. That began this morning. That will never be interrupted. The free exchange of these ideas will never be interrupted.\nWilson is known to have created the first working 3D-printed gun in 2013, and then began sharing blueprints. In 2013, the government had blocked the company from posting such blueprints. Wilson then sued the government in 2015, and in June of this year, after a multi-year lawsuit, the company came to an agreement with the U.S. Department of State allowing it to post designs online starting on Aug. 1. \nAt the end of July, eight state attorneys general sued to stop the company from being able to post the designs online. They argued that 3D-printed plastic firearms are dangerous because they are untraceable (as they do not have serial numbers), can be undetectable (if made with all plastic parts) and do not require background checks to produce. The Undetectable Firearms Act, which is already law, makes all plastic guns illegal. Defense Distributed includes a metal part in their guns in attempt to be compliant with that law. \nOn July 31, a federal judge temporarily blocked the plans from being posted. Prior to the judges decision, more than 1,000 people had downloaded the designs. Then on Monday, Judge Robert S. Lasnik of the U.S. District Court for Western Washington extended the temporary ban pending the outcome of the trial.\nThe court finds that the irreparable burdens on the private defendants First Amendment rights are dwarfed by the irreparable harms the states are likely to suffer if the existing restrictions are withdrawn and that, overall, the public interest strongly supports maintaining the status quo through the pendency of this litigation, Lasnik wrote.\nMondays court order also reads: Regulation under the [Arms Export Control Act of 1976] means that the files cannot be uploaded to the internet, but they can be emailed, mailed, securely transmitted, or otherwise published within the United States. The Act prohibits exporting weapons to outside the U.S. without prior government permission. \nAlthough the judge granted the plaintiff's injunction, saying the parties shall preserve the status quo until the case is decided, Wilson said he interpreted that section of the ruling to mean he has the legal authority to sell the gun designs. Wilson said he would prefer to give the plans away for free, but is happy now to sell them instead. He said customers could name their price. \nWilson argues that the case is an intersection between the First Amendment of the Constitution, which guarantees free speech, and the Second Amendment, which addresses the right to bear arms. He said in an interview with PragerU last week that the two amendments should grant his cause further protection. \nWilson also noted that manufacturing the 3D guns is as simple as pressing a button and you have a gun, and it requires making individual parts and then assembling them. His company also sells milling machines for $2,000 that are pre-loaded with design files. Milling machines can essentially carve away a part of a larger block of material to create an object. Wilsons machines can be used to create handguns and AR-15-style rifles in about two days. The company has a three-month backlog of orders for the machines, and Wilson says he screens people who want to buy his companys milling machines. He did not say how he screens them. \nAs Wilson has noted, other individuals have also created and distributed 3D gun blueprints online. \n\nSources: ABC News, Arms Export Control Act, CBS News, CNN, CNN, Defense Distributed, PragerU Interview, Preliminary Injunction",

Mel Reynolds (D-Ill.) was sentenced on Thursday to six months in prison for failing to report income from consulting work in Africa on his tax returns from 2009 to 2012, according to prosecutors. Reynolds, who acted as his own attorney, admitted guilt and asked for a year of probation, The Associated Press reported. \nReynolds has already spent two months in prison, which will count towards his six-month sentence, according to a prosecutors spokesperson. The maximum sentence he could have received was four years in prison, and prosecutors had asked for at least two years.\nReynolds was accused of not reporting nearly half a million in income to the IRS for consulting work performed in Africa on behalf of two Chicago businessmen. Reynolds said the money was for travel and expenses, didnt need to be reported as income, according to the Chicago Tribune. \nU.S. District Judge Robert Gettleman sentenced Reynolds, saying the time in prison will give you some time to think where you go from here. Reynolds, an African American, had told the judge putting him in jail wouldnt teach him a lesson because he has been taught about this racist society already. After his hearing, Reynolds told reporters outside the court that after his sentence he planned to go home to Africa.\nReynolds, a 66-year-old Harvard graduate who has served in the military, was elected to Congress in 1992, representing Illinois's 2nd Congressional District. He resigned in 1995 after being convicted of sexual assault and child pornography charges. Reynolds had engaged in a relationship with a campaign worker who was 16 years old. In 1997, he was convicted on unrelated charges of bank fraud and misusing campaign funds. He was released from prison in 2001.\nUpdate: This post has been updated to clarify that Reynolds failed to report income on tax returns he filed. \nSources: AP, Reuters",

      "Content": "Given the ongoing news of North Koreas plans to dismantle its nuclear facilities and to stop testing missiles, information about the countrys nuclear and missile capabilities may be useful. Weve compiled a timeline of the Norths missile and nuclear-weapon development from 1981 to 2018.\n1981: North Korea and Egypt agree to a ballistic missile development deal. Egypt transfers Russian-built Scud-B missiles and MAZ 543 transporter-erector-launchers (TEL) to North Korea.\n1983: Iranian Prime Minister Ruhollah Musavi and Defense Minister Colonel Mohammad Salimi arrange to finance North Koreas Scud-B development program in exchange for the ability to purchase production models.\n\n1984: North Korea successfully tests its first Scud-B missile.\n1985: North Korea signs the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). The treaty is intended to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and weapons technology, according to the U.N. Office for Disarmament Affairs.\n\n1987: Scud-B production facilities capable of producing 50 missiles annually are established near Pyongyang, the capital of North Korea. Later, South Korean Defense Minister Yi Ki-paek claims North Korea conducted a long-range guided missile (Scud-C prototype) test north of the city of Wonsan in Hamgyong-Namdo.\n1988: North Korea upgrades the Scud-B program to a Scud-C program, increasing the missiles range to about 373 miles (600 km). The same year, North Korea signs the Geneva Protocol, which prohibits the use of asphyxiating, poisonous or other gases, and of bacteriological methods of warfare.\n1989: North Korea starts to develop the Rodong, also called Nodong, intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM).\n1990: North Korea successfully launches a Scud-C missile over the Sea of Japan. A U.S. intelligence satellite also photographs the launch of a new IRBM (Rodong-1), with an estimated range of 620 miles (about 1000 km).\n1991: North and South Korea are admitted into the U.N. General Assembly. North Korea produces between four and eight Scud-C missiles per month, purportedly for resale rather than security. The country reportedly completes its prototype of the Rodong-1. South Koreas Ministry of Defense reports that North Korea has produced at least 1,000 tons of chemical warheads for its missiles, in violation of the Geneva Convention.\n1992: U.S. CIA Director Robert Gates announces that North Koreas nuclear and ballistic missile programs are our most urgent national security threat in East Asia. He says, North Korea has invested heavily in the military and depends on arms sales for much of its hard currency earnings.\n1993: North Korea successfully launches four missiles from Taepodong in Hwadae-gun. U.S. and Japanese intelligence officials suspect two of the missiles to be Rodong-1 missiles. They were reportedly fired at target buoys in the Sea of Japan. One missile traveled 311 miles (500 km) and another traveled about 62 miles (100 km); the other two reportedly did not surpass 62 miles.\n1994: In January, South Korean news outlet Hanguk Ilbo reports that North Korea has 12 to 18 Rodong-1 missiles and is developing the Rodong-2. \nIn February, U.S. intelligence satellites detect a new missile hardware mock-up at Pyongyang, which the U.S. designates as Taepodong-2. According to the intelligence report, the dimensions of Taepodong-2 suggest that it could travel up to 2,175 miles (3,500 km). \nIn March, U.S. officials report that North Korea is building two new medium-range missiles: Taepodong-1 (1,000+ mile range, or 1609+ km) and Taepodong-2 (2,000+ mile range, or 3,218+ km).\n1995: CIA Director James Woolsey tells the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence that the technology is moving from an era of Scuds of single-stage missiles into an area of Taepodong-1 and -2s with ranges in the few thousands of kilometers  not quite intercontinental yet, but the path is clear.\n1998: North Korea conducts the first flight test of its two-stage Taepodong-1 IRBM. The first stage of the missile separated, or fell off, about 186 miles (300 km) east of the launch site, decreasing the mass of the remainder of it. The second stage continued over the Island of Honshu and landed in the Pacific Ocean 205 miles (330 km) east of the Japanese port city of Hachinohe, after flying about 857.5 miles (1,380 km). North Korea says the launch was an attempt to place a satellite in orbit. Japan calls the launch a very dangerous act [that] will have a serious impact on the security of northeast Asia. The U.S. says its concerned about the launch.\n1999: U.S. intelligence reports say that North Korea conducted propulsion tests for the Taepodong-2 missile in April or May. The reports say that North Korea refurbished its missile launch pad and is transporting rocket fuel to storage centers.\n2003: North Korea withdraws from the NPT and starts acquiring weapons-grade plutonium from spent fuel rods.\n2005: North Korea announces that it possesses nuclear weapons.\n2006: North Korea test fires Taepodong-2, Rodong and Scud missiles. The Taepodong-2 can now travel about 9,320 miles (15,000 km). Later that year, North Korea reportedly conducts a successful nuclear test.\n2009: North Korea says it carried out a second nuclear test, as well as additional missile tests.\n2012: North Korea launches an Unha-3 rocket that puts its first satellite into space.\n2013: North Korea says it conducted a third nuclear test.\n2015: North Korea says it tested a submarine-launched missile and has developed technology to mount nuclear warheads on missiles.\n2016: North Korea claims it successfully tested a hydrogen bomb. Later in the year, the country says it conducted a fifth nuclear test and several ballistic missile tests.\n2017: Throughout the year, North Korea launches several missiles and announces that it conducted a sixth nuclear test. \nIn May, North Korea fires an intermediate-range Pukguksong-2 ballistic missile into the sea, as well as the Hwasong-12. \nIn July, Pyongyang says it carried out its first successful intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), the Hwasong-14. \nIn August, North Korea flies a missile over Japan for the first time since 2009. \nIn September, North Korea reportedly launches its sixth nuclear test: a hydrogen bomb estimated to have an explosive yield of 120 kilotons. North Korea also launches ICBMs in September and November.\n2018: North Korea meets with South Korea and U.S. leaders to discuss denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. In March, North Korea agrees to halt its testing of both nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles. \nIn June, U.S. President Donald Trump meets with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un for the first time; Trump later declares on Twitter that North Korea is no longer a nuclear threat. A month later, The Washington Post reports that U.S. spy agencies have seen signs that North Korea is constructing new ICBMs. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo also tells the U.S. Senate that North Korean factories continue to produce fissile material used in making nuclear weapons. \nIn a meeting with South Korean leaders in September, Kim reportedly agrees to permanently dismantle at least one nuclear test site and shut down at least one missile launch site, contingent on unspecified measures taken by the U.S.\n\nSources: BBC, Bloomberg, CBS, CNBC, CNN, NK missile timeline, South Korea statement, The Guardian, The New York Times - 1993, The Washington Post, Trump Twitter, UN NPT, Variety",

      "Content": "Early Wednesday morning local time, North Korea suspended talks with South Korea that were scheduled for later that day, citing South Korea-U.S. joint military drills. The North Korean state-run Central News Agency (KCNA) called the drills a provocation and alleged they were a preparation for an invasion of North Korea, South Korean news agency Yonhap reported. In March, the U.S. said it would conduct the joint military drills with South Korea as it has done in previous years.\nKCNA also said the U.S. would have to undertake careful deliberations about the fate of the planned meeting between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump in light of this provocative military drill. That meeting is scheduled for June 12 in Singapore. \nU.S. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said, We have not heard anything from the North and South Korea governments to indicate that we would not continue conducting these [joint military] exercises or that we would not continue planning for our meeting between President Trump and Kim Jong Un next month.\nWednesdays meeting between the Koreas was to be a follow-up to the April 27 meeting between Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in. Following that meeting, the two leaders issued a document called the Panmunjom Declaration for Peace, Prosperity and Unification of the Korean Peninsula. That document announced the countries had agreed to work towards the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and a formal close to the Korean War that ended in an armistice in 1953. Wednesdays meeting had been scheduled to discuss these goals.\nKCNA said, according to Yonhap, that the military exercise in South Korea is a flagrant challenge to the Panmunjom Declaration and an intentional military provocation running counter to the positive political development on the Korean Peninsula. \nThe U.S. and South Koreans began conducting air combat drills with U.S. stealth fighters and B-52 bombers last Friday for a period scheduled to last for two weeks.\nSources: CNBC, CNN, Reuters",

      "Content": "The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced Monday it will terminate El Salvadors Temporary Protected Status (TPS) on Sept. 9, 2019. The DHS indicated Salvadorans could in the interim leave the U.S. or \"seek an alternative lawful immigration status in the country, if eligible. \nDHS officials said 262,500 Salvadorans have been granted TPS since 2001. Close to 200,000 Salvadorans currently reside in the U.S. under TPS. Salvadoran Foreign Minister Hugo Martnez said the country will spend the next 18 months lobbying the U.S. Congress for a permanent solution to the issue.\nTPS was originally signed into law by President George Bush in 1990, and El Salvador participated in the program in 1994 because of its civil war. The designation was reissued for El Salvador following the 2001 earthquakes that killed more than 1,200 people and destroyed about 150,000 homes. TPS allowed illegal Salvadorans residing in the U.S. before the earthquakes to apply for protected status, allowing them to obtain work permits and prevent deportation. To remain and work in the U.S., TPS beneficiaries must renew permits every 18 months.\nThe DHS statement said the U.S. has repatriated more than 39,000 Salvadorans in the past two years, and that the temporary inability of El Salvador to adequately return their nationals after the earthquake has been addressed. \nThe statement also said, Only Congress can legislate a permanent solution addressing the lack of an enduring lawful immigration status of those currently protected by TPS who have lived and worked in the United States for many years, adding that, the 18-month delayed termination will allow Congress time to craft a potential legislative solution.\nEl Salvadors government has said TPS workers bring benefits to the U.S. economy. This weekend, the Foreign Ministry tweeted that 95 percent of Salvadorans in the program are employed or own their own businesses. The World Bank estimated that TPS remittances to El Salvador surpass $4.5 billion a year, which accounts for about 17 percent of the countrys GDP.\nOpponents of the decision have cited concerns over violence and gangs in the country, and a potentially destabilizing effect of so many people being sent home, according to The Washington Post. One estimate says El Salvador had the worlds second highest murder rate in 2016, with 64.2 murders per 100,000 population. The same estimate indicates about 60 percent of murders are due to gang activity.\nOpponents also cited concerns regarding the more than 192,000 U.S.-born children of TPS beneficiaries, should their parents or relatives be deported. \nProponents of the decision said it will open jobs to U.S. citizens and other lawful residents, and that those who return to El Salvador would bring with them skills and resources that could have a positive impact on the economy.\nIn November, Haitis and Nicaraguas TPS was also terminated. Honduras TPS was extended by six months in December.\nSources: The Los Angeles Times, NPR, The Washington Post (1), The Washington Post (2)",

      "Content": "President Donald Trump said on Friday morning that he was talking to North Korea after the day before canceling a meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un planned for next month. Well see what happens, it could even be the 12th, Trump said, referring to the June 12 date for which the summit was originally scheduled. \nIn an open letter to Kim on Thursday, Trump canceled the planned meeting between the two leaders in Singapore next month, writing: based on the tremendous anger and open hostility displayed in your most recent statement, I feel it is inappropriate, at this time, to have this long-planned meeting. Earlier on Thursday, North Koreas vice minister of foreign affairs called Vice President Mike Pence a political dummy after comments he made about North Korea on Monday.\nOn Friday, in response to Trumps cancellation, North Korea released a statement saying it was still willing to give the U.S. time and opportunities to reconsider talks at any time, at any format. Trump called the Norths statement good news in a tweet, adding, will soon see where it will lead, hopefully to long and enduring prosperity and peace. To reporters outside the White House on Friday morning, he said, everybody plays games.\nPences comments on Monday\nOn Monday, Pence spoke about North Korea on Fox News, referring to comments made by National Security Adviser John Bolton in April. At that time, Bolton spoke about North Korean nuclear disarmament, saying the U.S. had in mind the Libya model from 2003, 2004. In 2003, Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi agreed to denuclearization in exchange for sanctions being lifted. Rebels overthrew and killed Gadhafi in 2011. Prior to Gadhafis death, NATO forces carried out an airstrike on Gadhafis convoy, and later said they did not know he was in it.\nLast week, Trump said, the Libyan model isnt a model that we have at all when were thinking of North Korea. He said, In Libya we decimated that country, adding, There was no deal to keep Qaddafi. Trump also said, That model would take place if we dont make a deal [with North Korea], most likely.\nPence said on Fox News, \"There was some talk about the Libya model. As the President made clear, this will only end like the Libya model ended if Kim Jong Un doesn't make a deal.\" When Fox News Martha MacCallum said some people may have taken Bolton's comments about the Libya model as a threat, Pence said \"I think it's more of a fact.\" \nNorth Koreas comments on Thursday\nNorth Koreas vice minister of foreign affairs Choe Sun Hui said Pences remarks comparing North Korea to Libya were unbridled and imprudent. She said, \"As a person involved in the U.S. affairs, I cannot suppress my surprise at such ignorant and stupid remarks gushing out from the mouth of the U.S. vice president. \nHui also said, \"Whether the U.S. will meet us at a meeting room or encounter us at nuclear-to-nuclear showdown is entirely dependent upon the decision and behavior of the United States.\nHui said the U.S. asked for the dialogue with North Korea and now it is misleading the public opinion as if we have invited them to sit with us. In his letter to Kim, Trump said, We were informed that the meeting was requested by North Korea, but that to us is totally irrelevant.\nTrumps letter on Thursday\nTrump wrote that he had been very much looking forward to meeting with Kim. He said, the Singapore summit, for the good of both parties, but to the detriment of the world, will not take place.\"\nTrump thanked Kim for the release of three American hostages earlier this month, calling it a beautiful gesture and very much appreciated. \nTrump ended the letter to Kim, saying, If you change your mind having to do with this most important summit, please do not hesitate to call me or write. The world, and North Korea in particular, has lost a great opportunity for lasting peace and great prosperity and wealth. This missed opportunity is a truly sad moment in history.\nSources:AP,CNBC, CNN, The White House",

      "Content": "California Supreme Court ruled Monday that online review site Yelp.com cannot be ordered by a judge to remove posts against a San Francisco law firm. The court ruled that federal law protected digital platforms like Yelp from liability for statements written by others, and that removing a post would be up to the companys discretion. The 4-3 decision by the justices overturned a lower court ruling.\nForcing a site to remove user-generated posts can impose substantial burdens on the online company, Chief Justice Tani Cantil-Sakauye wrote in the majority opinion. Even if it would be mechanically simple to implement such an order, compliance still could interfere with and undermine the viability of an online platform.\nWhile the plaintiffs lawyer, Monique Olivier, argued that the state Supreme Courts ruling stands as an invitation to spread falsehoods on the internet without consequence, Yelp argued that the court order would have given businesses the ability to seek legal action for unwanted or negative reviews.\nAaron Schur, a deputy general counsel for Yelp, said Mondays decision lets online publishers in California know that they cannot be lawfully forced to remove third-party speech through enterprising abuses of the legal system. Schur also said Yelp had determined that the reviews about Hassells law firm were not libelous.\nOlivier said her client was considering an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.\nBackground\nIn a 2013 lawsuit, attorney Dawn Hassell accused a client she had represented in a personal injury case of defamation after the client posted a Yelp review claiming the attorneys firm didnt adequately communicate with the client. San Francisco Superior Court Judge Donald Sullivan ruled in favor of Hassell and ordered the client and Yelp to remove the review. When the client and Yelp didnt remove the post, Hassell received a court order from a second judge telling Yelp to remove it. The order was also upheld by a state appeals court.\nFacebook, Twitter and Microsoft sent a letter to the California Supreme Court that said the lower court ruling radically departs from a large, unanimous and settled body of federal and state court precedent and could be used to silence a vast quantity of protected and important speech.\nYelp then began working with the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), which filed an amicus brief in the Yelp case in 2016. Amicus briefs arefiled with a court by non-litigants with an interest in a given case, to provide the court with additional information or arguments it might deem relevant. \nThe ACLU argued that the removal order requires Yelp to remove speech from its website without giving it any opportunity to argue that the speech in question is constitutionally protected.\nSources: AP, The New York Times",

Under the new agreement, beginning May 1, South Korea would be exempt from a 25 percent U.S. tariff on steel. Negotiators are finalizing the terms of the deal, which requires domestic approval in both countries before being implemented.\nUnder the agreement, South Koreas exports of steel to the U.S. would be subject to a quota of 2.68 million tons, about 70 percent of 2015-2017 average exports to the U.S. South Korea was the third-largest exporter of steel to the U.S. in 2016, according to The New York Times.\nU.S. tariffs on imports of goods from South Korea would remain the same as under the 2012 agreement, according to Krystal Tan, an economist at the research firm Capital Economics. South Korea is subject to the 10 percent tariff on aluminum that Trump announced on March 1, CNN reported.\nThe yearly quota of U.S. vehicles that could be sold in South Korea without adhering to local safety standards would be raised from 25,000 per automaker to 50,000. The agreement would remove labeling requirements on American cars that meet U.S. safety standards and do not meet Korean ones. In 2017, no U.S. car company sold more than 11,000 cars in South Korea, CNN reported. A 25 percent tariff on pickup truck imports from South Korea to the U.S. would remain in effect until 2041; it had been scheduled to be phased out in 2021. \nThe countries also agreed not to manipulate their respective currencies to make their exports cheaper. There was no mechanism of enforcement related to this aspect of the agreement.\nA joint statement between the countries said the agreement addresses issues related to investment, tariffs, trade in automobiles, and trade remedies. Negotiators also made additional progress in the areas of pharmaceuticals, customs and textiles.\nThe joint statement added, This represents important progress in improving U.S.-Korea trade and economic relations, based on their strong and enduring security relationship.\nAccording to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, the original KORUS FTA was signed in 2007 and came into effect in 2012. Total trade in goods and services between the countries in 2016 was $144.6 billion. South Korea was the U.S. sixth largest trading partner in goods, at $112.2 billion total. The U.S. trade deficit in goods with South Korea was $27.7 billion, while in goods and services it was $17.0 billion. \nIn 2016, top export categories to South Korea from the U.S. were machinery, electrical machinery, aircraft, vehicles, and optical and medical instruments. Top import categories were vehicles, electrical machinery, machinery, pharmaceuticals and mineral fuels. U.S. vehicle exports to South Korea were $2.2 billion and imports were $21 billion.\nSources: CNN, The New York Times",

Such devices allow semi-automatic weapons to fire faster. A bump stock device was used by Stephen Paddock in the Oct. 1, 2017 Las Vegas shooting in which he killed 58 people.\nIn the memo, Trump said that after the Vegas shooting he asked his administration to fully review how the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives regulates bump fire stocks and similar devices. Trump said the Department of Justice had received over 100,000 comments from the public by Jan. 25 on proposed regulations. Trump called for the Justice Department to review the comments before recommending a rule banning all devices that turn legal weapons into machineguns.\nProposed regulations would have to be published in the Federal Registrar and would be subject to further public comment before being adopted.\nSources: CNBC, The New York Times",

      "Content": "On Wednesday, Poland signed a deal with the U.S. to purchase a $4.57 billion Patriot missile defense system. Polish President Andrzej Duda said the deal was Polands introduction into a world of state-of-the-art technology, modern weaponry, and defensive means. Two-thirds of Polands weapons systems are from the communist era, according to Reuters. Russia has nuclear-capable missile systems in Kaliningrad, bordering Poland, BBC reported.\nPoland increased the rate at which it was acquiring new weaponry after Russia annexed Ukraines Crimea peninsula in 2014, according to both news outlets.\nThe Patriot missile deal is the largest ever military procurement for Poland. Deliveries of the Raytheon-manufactured system are scheduled to begin in 2022. Raytheon is to deliver two Patriot batteries, each with two firing units. Patriot systems are surface-to-air missile systems for striking aircraft, and cruise and ballistic missiles. The U.S. is deploying anti-missile systems in Europe, and placed a land-based missile defense base in Romania in 2016. \nRussian Deputy Foreign Minister Vladimir Titov said in November that deployments of Patriot missiles were part of a U.S. effort to put missile defense systems around Russia under the pretext of mythical threats to security.\nOn March 1, Russian President Vladimir Putin delivered his annual state of the union address, in which he said Russia had developed missiles with a practically unlimited range that can travel an unpredictable flight path. Putin said the missile would make existing missile defense systems useless. \nPoland is in negotiations with the U.S. to purchase additional Patriot missile systems in the future, as well as a low-cost interceptor missile and a 360-degree radar, Reuters reported. At least 14 countries, six within the 29-member North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), have Patriot missile systems. Poland joined NATO in 1999.\nOn Monday, the U.S. and other countries, including Poland, expelled a total of more than 100 Russian diplomats in response to the March 4 poisoning of Sergei Skripal, a former Russian double agent, and his daughter in the U.K. On March 12, British Prime Minister Theresa May said it was highly likely that Russia was responsible for the attack, which utilized a Soviet Union-developed nerve agent, Novichok. The U.S., France and Germany issued a joint statement with the U.K. agreeing with its assessment.\nSources: BBC, Reuters",

Mordaunts comment was in response to an article published by the Times on Friday reported that Oxfam mishandled allegations of sexual misconduct by its employees in Haiti. The article reported that Oxfam failed to notify legal authorities after conducting an internal investigation and dismissing certain employees. \nThe allegations of sexual misconduct are from 2011, when Oxfam was working in Haiti after a 7.0 magnitude earthquake that killed up to 300,000 people. The allegations include a claim that Oxfams country director Roland Van Hauwermeiren used prostitutes. The Times investigation report said it could not be ruled out that any of the prostitutes were under-aged. It alleged there was a culture of impunity among some staff in Haiti.\nThe charity conducted an internal investigation at the time, which led to four people being fired. Three others, including Van Hauwermeiren, resigned. The details of the allegations were not published in the organizations concluding report, which referred to serious misconduct.\nOxfam said in a statement on Friday that its misconduct findings had related to offences including bullying, harassment, intimidation and failure to protect staff as well as sexual misconduct. It neither confirmed nor denied specific allegations in The Times article. \nMordaunt said the organization did the wrong thing by not reporting the details of the allegations. She said she wrote to British organizations about their efforts to safeguard staff and people they work with from harm. She said the ministry expected organizations with safeguarding issues to cooperate fully with the authorities, and would cease to fund any organization that does not. The minister is scheduled to meet with an Oxfam representative about the allegations on Monday.\nThe charitable organization received 32 million ($44m) from the U.K. government in the last financial year.\nOxfams chair of trustees Caroline Thompson said it was introducing new measures to increase vetting and induction of new staff, as well as reporting between aid agencies about people who have been found guilty of sexual misconduct. She added that improvements had already been made since 2011.\nSources: BBC, Reuters,The Times",

      "Content": "Israeli soldiers have killed at least 19 Palestinians and injured more than 1,000 since protests began along the Gaza border last Friday. An Israeli aircraft killed a Palestinian protester near the Gaza Strip border fence on Thursday, according to Palestinian health officials. Another protester that Israeli soldiers shot last Friday also died on Thursday. \n\nPalestinians began demonstrations and sit-ins on the anniversary of Land Day, and they were scheduled to last a total of six weeks. Land Day is held in remembrance of an incident in which Israeli forces fatally shot six Palestinians on March 30, 1976, as the Palestinians were protesting Israeli land seizures. \nThe protests, called The March of Return, are scheduled to end on May 15, known as Nakba Day, which recognizes the approximately 750,000 people who left their homes in the violence leading up to and during the May 1948 war between Israel and neighboring countries. Protesters are calling for Palestinians who left Israeli areas during and around the May 1948 war, and their descendants, to be granted the right to return to those areas. Israel said it will not allow the right of return. \nThere are tens of thousands of demonstrators gathered in five locations along the border between Israel and the Palestinian territory of Gaza. Initially, Palestinians stayed about 2,300 feet (700 meters) away from the border fence, Al Jazeera reported. \nSome of the protesters have rolled burning tires, thrown rocks and reportedly attempted to damage the border fence. Some have said they intend to use mirrors and lasers to distract Israeli snipers, according to The Jerusalem Post. Israeli Public Security Minister Gilad Erdan said Israel was prepared for every scenario, even an attempt to cause sharpshooters to lose focus. \nIsraeli snipers have shot protesters that the Israeli military said had approached the border fence. Israel has also used rubber bullets and tear gas on Palestinian protesters.\nThe Jerusalem Post reported that Palestinian militant groups said some of those killed were their members. It didnt specify which groups reportedly said this. Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus, and Israeli army spokesman, said Hamas was attempting to use the protests as a diversion to open up the fence and then to insert terrorists into Israel.\nIsraeli Minister of Defense Avigdor Lieberman said Israel did not intend to change its rules of engagement and that if there are provocations, there will be a reaction of the harshest kind like last week.\nHamas, the political group that governs Gaza, said on Thursday it would give $3,000 to the families of anyone killed in the protests and $500 or $200 to those wounded, depending on the severity of the injuries. Hamas official Mohammed Thuraya said, This is our duty to our people, to ease the suffering of our citizens. He said it wasnt a price tag on casualties.\nU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for an independent investigation into the deaths. On Saturday, the U.S. blocked a draft resolution by the U.N. Security Council that called for an investigation into the killing of 17 Palestinian protesters near the Gaza border during the current protests. Walter Miller, U.S. representative to the U.N., said bad actors were using the protests as a cover to incite violence.\nJason Greenblatt, the U.S. envoy to the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, said in a statement, We condemn leaders and protesters who call for violence or who send protesters - including children - to the fence, knowing that they may be injured or killed.\nSources: Al Jazeera, Reuters, The Jerusalem Post, The New York Times",

      "Content": "The U.S. Supreme Court ruled 6-3 on Monday in favor of New Jersey to invalidate a federal law that prohibited states from legalizing and regulating sports betting. The invalidated legislation, the federal Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) of 1992, had made the majority of sports gambling illegal outside of Nevada. The Supreme Court ruled that PASPA violates the Constitutions 10th Amendment on powers reserved by the states from the federal government.\nPASPA and background\nExcept in cases where specific types of sports gambling were already legal in a state during a certain time period, PASPA made it illegal for states to sponsor, operate, advertise, promote, license, or authorize sports betting. Sports gambling in Nevada, as well as more restricted sports betting such as lotteries in Montana, Delaware and Oregon, were allowed to continue under the law.\nIn 2014, New Jersey passed a law to repeal some provisions of its prohibitions on sports gambling at racetracks and casinos, after a 2011 gambling law was overturned in court. The National Collegiate Athletics Association (NCAA) challenged the 2014 law and a lower court ruled against the state. Then Governor Chris Christie took the case, Christie vs. NCAA, to the Supreme Court. The case was later renamed Murphy vs. NCAA after Phil Murphy became the governor. New Jersey was joined in the lawsuit by 18 other states.\nThe NCAA and professional sports leagues such as the NFL and NBA had argued in favor of keeping PASPA. With legal sports gambling in more states, these sports organizations may incur additional expenses for the education of players, monitoring of betting trends for any suspect activity, and investigations, according to The Washington Post. The NFL said in a statement, Congress has long-recognized the potential harms posed by sports betting to the integrity of sporting contests and the public confidence in these events. The organization said it would work to protect our fans and the integrity of our game in any states that legalize sports gambling.\nSupreme Court Ruling\nIn the majority opinion for the court, Justice Samuel Alito wrote, referencing the 10th Amendment: The legalization of sports gambling requires an important policy choice, but the choice is not ours to make. Congress can regulate sports gambling directly, but if it elects not to do so, each state is free to act on its own. He also wrote that Congress cannot issue direct orders to state legislatures.\nThe 10th Amendment says, The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people.\nJustice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote in her dissenting opinion that the majority decision wields an ax to cut down the law instead of using a scalpel to trim it. She favored rewriting the PASPA to no longer prohibit certain state laws as it does now, and instead ban states and private parties from sponsoring sports gambling regardless of what the state laws were.\nResponse\nNew Jersey and West Virginia have passed legislation that allows sports gambling, according to The Washington Post. In New Jersey, Monmouth Park racetrack said it could open windows for sports betting within two weeks.\nDraftKings, a fantasy sports site, said Monday that it would enter the sports betting market and would work with states that passed legislation authorizing sports gambling to apply for licenses to do so.\nFormer Gov. Christie, who initiated the suit, tweeted that it was great day for the rights of states and their people to make their own decisions.\nA study by University of Nevada Las Vegas (UNLV) found that there was about $5 billion in legal sports betting in Nevada last year, with $1.76 billion of that from college and professional football.\nSources: CNN, Delaware Online, The Washington Post 1, The Washington Post 2, US Congress, US Supreme Court",

      "Content": "A British court ruled Tuesday that the ride-hailing company Uber should be issued a 15-month probationary license to operate in London. After a two-day hearing, the judge said the license could be granted on the condition that Uber is subject to independently verified audits every six months. Uber agreed to report all serious safety complaints, train drivers on ride-sharing safety, and report any major data breaches to the citys transportation regulatory body, Transport for London (TfL). \nLast September, TfL declined to renew Ubers license to operate in London due to what it called public safety and security implications relating to the companys operations. Uber appealed the decision and was permitted to keep operating in the city while the appeal was ongoing. \nDara Khosrowshahi, a former Expedia CEO, was named Ubers CEO last August, after the companys former CEO Travis Kalanick resigned in June of last year. Khosrowshahi implemented changes in how the company operated, including changes in the U.K. such as adding a 24-hour phone line for driver support, limiting working hours and providing limited insurance. The ruling judge, Emma Arbuthnot, said that with the companys new governance, it was now fit and proper to hold a private hire vehicles operator license in the city.\nTfL's interim head of licensing, Helen Chapman, told the court on Tuesday, \"We've had five years of a very difficult relationship where Uber has felt that they haven't required regulation and being regulated in the same way as everyone else we regulate.\nAs part of its hearings this week, Uber lawyer Thomas de la Mare said it accepted Septembers rejection of its license application as right. Uber also requested an 18-month license, down from the five-year license it had previously requested. Uber said it had passed the TfLs last three inspections. \nUbers U.K. general manager, Tom Elvidge, said the company was pleased with the decision. We will continue to work with TfL to address their concerns and earn their trust, while providing the best possible service for our customers, he said. \nAs part of the agreement, the court ruled Uber would pay for the cost of the appeal, about $562,000 (425,000 British pounds). \nAbout 45,000 of Ubers 60,000 drivers in Britain are in London, according to Business Insider. About 3.6 million passengers use Uber in the city.\nSources: Business Insider 1, Business Insider 2, The Guardian",

Opposition leader Nelson Chamisa had failed to prove his claim that the election was fraudulent, the court ruled. Chamisa did not attend the inauguration, while some other opposition leaders did. \nThe vision of a new and prosperous Zimbabwe, the Zimbabwe we want, is a shared one and transcends political party lines, Mnangagwa said during his inauguration speech. As your President, I pledge to act fairly and impartially, without fear or favor, as a President of all Zimbabweans. I am your listening President, a servant leader.\nIn reference to violence around the election, the president said, such conduct should be alien and vile to our nature, culture and traditions as the Zimbabwean people. At least 6 people were killed during the protests following the election.\nAfter the election on July 30, official results were not immediately released and the opposition alleged the delay was to fabricate results. The main opposition party, the MDC, organized protests in the capital city of Harare, which resulted in 6 deaths. The military shot live ammunition at some protesters, after firing warning shots and used a water cannon. Protesters reportedly damaged property, burned tires, threw rocks and blocked streets. \nThen on Aug. 3, the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC) declared incumbent President Mnangagwa of the Zanu-PF party the winner with 50.8 percent of the vote. Chamisa of the MDC party won 44.3 percent of the vote, according to the ZEC. The MDC filed a complaint with the court.\nFor the first time since 2012, Zimbabwe permitted election observers from the U.S. and the European Union to monitor the vote. Elmar Brok, leader of the EUs election observer mission, was critical of the election commissions lack of transparency and noted some problems around polling stations on voting day. He also said that in some senses, up to this point, the conduct of the polls has had a number of positive features, though said delays in the election commission releasing official results could result in it losing credibility.\nRights groups also alleged there was state-sponsored vote-buying and intimidation leading up to the election.\nIn the rural areas people's houses get burned, destroyed, on account of expressing themselves. It's un-African, it is undemocratic, it is unacceptable, Chamisa said. And this is the issue we must be able to resolve, because five years from now, 20 years from now, we will still have a vicious circle of disputed elections.\nThe August election was the first since former President Robert Mugabe resigned from office last November after a 37-year rule. He resigned following a military coup took over the government. Zanu-PF then appointed Mnangagwa, who had previously been vice president under Mugabe, as its new leader.\n\nSources: Al Jazeera, BBC, NPR, The Washington Post, The Washington Post, The Washington Post",

      "Content": "Two assailants killed at least 39 people and injured at least 80 others at a Shiite mosque in eastern Afghanistan on Friday, local officials said. Two men armed with guns and explosives entered the mosque in the city of Gardez, about 50 miles (80 km) south of Kabul in Paktia province, during Fridays afternoon prayers. No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack, and the Taliban denied it was responsible.\nThe assailants were dressed in burkas with full face veils, according to a spokesman for Paktia province, Sardar Wali Tabasum. One opened fire on the worshipers before the second one blew up explosives on his body, Tabasum said. \nAbdullah Hasrat, a spokesman for the provincial governor, confirmed that 39 people had been killed. He said children and several senior Shiite clerics were among the deceased. \nPresident Ashraf Ghani called the attack inhumane, and alleged it was intended to create sectarian division. \nAfghanistans population is approximately 99 percent Muslim, with an estimated 80 to 89 percent Sunni Muslims, and estimated 10 to 19 percent Shiite Muslims, according to World Population Review statistics. The Islamic State (IS) militant group has previously attacked Shiite mosques and considers Shiites heretical. IS has not claimed responsibility for this attack. \nRecent Afghanistan attacks\nOn Tuesday, an attack at a government compound in the eastern Afghanistan city of Jalalabad killed at least 15 people, and injured 15 others. IS claimed responsibility for that attack.\nIn a separate incident Tuesday, at least 11 people were killed and 37 more wounded when a passenger bus drove over a roadside bomb in the city of Farah, officials said. The government said the Taliban was responsible for the attack, according to Al Jazeera correspondent Charlotte Bellis. The Taliban did not immediately claim responsibility.\nAlso on Tuesday, unknown assailants abducted 22 people from their vehicles in a highway between Kabul and Gardez, BBC reported. \nOn Saturday, attackers entered a training center for midwives in Jalalabad and battled government forces there for nearly six hours. Two people were killed in that attack.\n\nThe United Nations reported that 1,692 Afghan civilians were killed in the first half of the year, the most in a six-month period since 2009, when it began keeping records. Al Jazeera reported that 2,427 Afghanis have been killed and 3,929 injured in 151 attacks since January 2016.\nU.S.-led forces removed the Taliban from power in Afghanistan in 2001, following the 9/11 attacks. In June, the Afghan government declared a temporary ceasefire with the Taliban and the Taliban responded by declaring a ceasefire with the government for three days. IS and other militant groups are also active in Afghanistan. The U.S. has recently conducted airstrikes against IS targets, BBC reported. \nSources: Al Jazeera, BBC, The Washington Post, World Population Review",

Cape Town officials originally predicted that water would run out on April 21, a date referred to as Day Zero. Deputy Mayor Ian Neilson said on Tuesday that due to a drop in the dam levels of 1.4 percent, Day Zero has, as of today, moved forward. \nNeilson said that desalination (the removal of salt from sea water) and aquifer projects would not produce enough water to prevent the city from running out of drinking water.\nIn a statement released on Monday, the mayors office said that starting Feb. 2, Cape Towns 3.7 million residents would have a daily allowance of 50 liters, or slightly more than 13 gallons, per person for the next 150 days, or face fines for exceeding use. Residents have been asked to limit showers to 90 seconds, and some are reusing bath water to flush toilets, CNN reported. \nWe can no longer ask people to stop wasting water. We must force them, the mayors statement said. The city council is scheduled to vote on Friday to impose a punitive tariff for water usage over 6,000 liters (1,585 gallons) per month. \nSources: CNN, Fox News",

      "Content": "Seventeen states plus the District of Columbia filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration on Tuesday, seeking the reunification of separated immigrant families. The states, all with Democratic attorneys general, including California, New York and Washington, filed the suit in a federal court in Seattle. \n \n President Donald Trump signed an executive order last week to detain alien families together where appropriate, without commenting on what would happen with families that were already separated. \nThe lawsuit alleges that the Trump administration \"violated the constitutional due process rights of the parents and children by separating them as a matter of course and without any finding that the parent poses a threat to the children,\" according to the New York Attorney General's Office.\nIt also alleges that the practice of family separations is \"irrationally discriminatory\" and violates the constitutional guarantee of equal protection \"because it targets only people crossing our southwestern border, the majority of whom are from Latin America, and not anyone crossing the northern border or entering the United States elsewhere,\" according to the New York Attorney Generals Office.\n\"The Court should order Defendants to reunite every family separated by these unlawful acts immediately,\" the lawsuit reads.\nThe states that sued are California, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia and Washington.\nIn a separate case in a San Diego federal court, a judge is considering a request brought by the American Civil Liberties Union to issue an injunction ordering the administration to reunite separated children with their parents. \nBackground on the immigration policy\nThe Trump administration announced a zero-tolerance policy in April that called for all adults who were found illegally crossing the border to be charged with federal crimes for illegal entry or attempted entry. Under federal law, children cannot be held in adult criminal detention centers, so the policy has resulted in children being separated from parents or guardians. Last week, Trumps executive order said his administrations policy was to detain alien families together where appropriate and consistent with law and available resources. \nThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) last week said 2,342 immigrant children had been separated from their parents since April. Alex Azar, Secretary for Health and Human Services (HHS), said on Tuesday that HHS has 2,047 immigrant children in its custody. DHS said in a statement over the weekend that the U.S. government knows the location of all children in its custody and is working to reunite them with their families. DHS said that 522 children had been reunited with their parents since May. This process is well coordinated, DHS said. \nOn Monday, the Customs and Border Protection commissioner, Kevin McAleenan, said Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) would stop referring cases for criminal prosecution involving undocumented parents who arrived in the U.S. with their children, unless the child was in danger or the adult had a criminal record. McAleenan said ICE does not have enough detention space to accommodate all undocumented immigrant families. \nOn Monday, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the U.S. was not changing its zero-tolerance policy. Were simply out of resources, she said. Were working with Congress, hopefully, to provide more resources and the ability to actually enforce the law.\nSources: AP, CNN, The Guardian, The New York Times, The White House",

Changes to presidential powers are scheduled to take effect after the next election, originally planned for November 2019, in accordance with a referendum last year. Erdoan cited the situation in Syria, where Turkey is fighting a Kurdish group, as a factor in the decision to call early elections. \nSwitching to a new system of government has increasingly gained urgency so that decisions regarding our countrys future can be made and implemented with greater strength, Erdoan said in announcing the decision. He added that the cross-border operations in Syria and incidents of historic importance centered in Syria and Iraq have made it imperative for Turkey to overcome uncertainties quickly.\nTurkish forces have been fighting the Kurdish YPG group in northwestern Syria. Turkey considers the YPG a terrorist group with ties to the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has fought for autonomy in southeastern Turkey. The YPG has denied direct links with PKK.\nErdoan said he decided to call early elections after talking to the head of the MHP party, Devlet Bahceli. This year, Erdoans AK party formed an election alliance with the MHP party, according to The Washington Post.\nTurkish governmental powers \nIn April of last year, Turkey passed a referendum on constitutional changes in a 51.4 percent vote. The changes, which are scheduled to be implemented after the next presidential election, include eliminating the position of prime minister, allowing the president to appoint ministers without parliamentary approval and increasing the numbers of senior judges chosen by the president. \nThe referendum vote was held almost a year after a failed coup attempt to overthrow Erdoans government in July 2016. After the coup attempt, which led to 241 deaths, Turkey implemented a state of emergency. Turkeys parliament is scheduled to vote on Wednesday on whether to extend the state of emergency again, after six previous extensions.\nA U.N. report last month said there had been human rights violations in Turkey under the state of emergency, including arbitrary detentions and torture. There have been some sit-in protests in Turkey this week against extending the state of emergency.\nRead more about the 2016 coup attempt andthe events that followed here.\nSources: Reuters, The Washington Post",

      "Content": "Women marched in multiple cities and unions in Spain went on strike this Thursday for International Women's Day. There were womens protests in 170 countries, Spanish newspaper El Pas reported. Spain had proposed a general strike with union backing for Thursday in support of gender equality between men and women, according to El Pas. About 5.3 million people went on strike for a day in Spain, according to unions there. Spanish law prohibits unions from holding strikes that only apply to one of the sexes, so both men and women were allowed to stop working.\nThe population of Spain in 2016 was 46.4 million, and the labor force in 2017 was 22.9 million, according to the World Bank; the strike represented 11 percent of the population and 23 percent of the labor force.\nSpains nationwide strikes were an initiative of Comisin 8M, a group of about 400 members of various womens organizations, El Pas reported. One hundred and twenty marches and 182 gatherings were planned in 200 Spanish municipalities, according to Comisin 8M. Large unions such as UGT and CC OO called for two-hour strikes, and others such as CGT and CNT called for 24 hours. The female mayors of Barcelona and Madrid supported the strikes.\nOne of the Spanish protests slogans was, If we stop, the world stops. Organizers also called upon women to not spend money and not perform domestic work, such as housework, on Thursday. \nA survey of Spaniards by El Pas found that 82 percent of people said the strikes were justified, according to the newspaper. \nIn Spain, men in the public sector make an unadjusted average of 13 percent more than women, and in the private sector they make an unadjusted average of 19 percent more, according to Eurostat.Eurostat reported that Spain's \"explained\" gender pay gap is around 4 percent; it's \"explained\" figures account for \"differences in average characteristics of men and women (including sectoral and occupational gender segregations) in the labour market.\"\nTwo of the five female ministers in the Spanish government said they would work longer hours on Thursday to demonstrate the capacity of women for work.\nDuring the strike, Spanish authorities guaranteed certain percentages of transit services would continue on Thursday. This included 50-75 percent of the countrys commuter train lines and 35-65 percent of domestic flights. The National Federation of Self-Employed Workers said the majority of the more than 1.1 million self-employed women in Spain worked on Thursday.\nOther demonstrations\nPeople demonstrated in other cities around the world, including: Kabul, Afghanistan; Manila, Philippines; Seoul, South Korea; New Delhi, India; and Karachi, Pakistan. \nIn Rome, Catholic women called for increased influence in church governance. Women in Saudi Arabia and in Mosul, Iraq, went out in jogging and running groups. A French newspaper, Libration, increased its price for men by 25 percent for one day. AP reported that, on average, women in France earn 25 percent less than men.\nAlso on Thursday, the White House announced that First Lady Melania Trump would present the 2018 International Women of Courage Award on March 21.\nSources: AP, BBC, El Pas, The Guardian",

The three-member NSU also was responsible for two bombings in areas of Cologne with Turkish immigrant populations, and for 15 bank robberies, according to prosecutors. Zschepe denied having prior knowledge of the murders, which were allegedly carried out by the other two NSU members.\nThe judges said Zschepe, 43, bore a particularly heavy guilt, and gave her the maximum possible sentence. After a five-year trial, Zschaepe was also found guilty of arson, being a member of a terrorist organization and being a co-perpetrator in two bombings.\nZschepes lawyer, Mathias Grasel, called the verdict wrong and said he would appeal the ruling. Grasel said, Conviction for complicity is legally untenable. The fact is: Ms. Zschepe was demonstrably present at no crime scene and never fired a weapon or detonated a bomb.\nZschepe later said she felt morally responsible for not stopping the two men in the NSU from committing the murders, and apologized to the victims families. In her closing statement in court last week, she said, \"I am a compassionate person and was able to see and feel the distress and despair of the families.\nNSU members Uwe Behnhardt and Uwe Mundlos allegedly committed the murders. The two men killed themselves in 2011 when police located them after they allegedly robbed a bank. Investigators then connected the group to the murders, according to NBC News. Zschepe later turned herself in to police. Prosecutors said she was involved in planning the murders and providing money and alibis for the men.\nThe chairman of a parliamentary inquest, Uli Gretsch, alleged that the three NSU members were supported by a broad network of neo-Nazis. Four men were also found guilty of supporting the NSU, including by the procurement ofweapons, and were sentenced to between two and a half and 10 years in prison.\nThe NSU is described as a neo-Nazi group in the media, and Zschepe has been called the Nazi bride.\nResponse to the verdict\nGerman Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said, What the perpetrators did cannot be made up for. The victims will never be forgotten. He said diversity and enforcement of the law could help Germany reduce racially-motivated violence, according to Reuters.\nBavarian Interior Minister Joachim Herrmann said, This is a just punishment for the NSUs cold-blooded and unprecedented series of crimes. Five of the 10 murders occurred in Bavaria. \nTurkeys foreign ministry said, Unfortunately, the ruling made today has not brought to light the real criminals, the background of the NSU murders and the connection between the deep state and intelligence to its full extent. It did not elaborate further on the meaning of its statement.\n\nSources: Al Jazeera, NBC News, Reuters, The Guardian",

Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariris Future Movement party won 21 seats, fewer than the 33 it previously held. \nHariris Future Movement has maintained its position as the largest Sunni Muslim bloc in the House and Hariri will likely to be asked to form the new national unity cabinet, according to BBC. In Lebanon, the power sharing system requires the prime minister to be a Sunni Muslim, the president to be a Maronite Christian, and the parliament speaker a Shiite Muslim. Parliamentary seats are divided in accordance with quotas according to the religious sects.\nVoter turnout on Sunday was 49.2 percent of 3.6 million eligible voters, compared with 54 percent in 2009, according to Reuters.\nLebanons 2013 elections were delayed when Members of Parliament (MPs) extended their terms because parties could not agree on a new electoral law, BBC reported. The system was later changed from first-past-the-post (FPTP) to a proportional representation (PR) system. \nFPTP refers to election systems that grant a seat to the candidate who receives the most votes in his or her district, similar to the U.S. system. PR electoral systems grant seats to candidates based on the percentage of total votes that party receives. For example, in a basic PR system, if a party receives 25 percent of the votes, it would get to fill 25 percent of the seats with its preferred candidates, regardless of the local area in which each candidate lives. \nHezbollah\nHezbollah is a political, military and social organization. It is designated a terrorist group by the U.S. and Israel. The group has sent thousands of fighters to support Syrian President Bashar al-Assads conflict against Syrian rebel groups and the Islamic State. \nTwo of Hezbollahs allies in Lebanon are the Shiite Amal Movement and the Christian Free Patriotic Movement. Hezbollah is also supported by Iran, according to The Washington Post. \nLeaders responses\nHezbollahs leader, Hassan Nasrallah, said the election result was a political and moral victory and that the new government should form quickly and through cooperation. \nPrime Minister Hariri said, My hand is extended to every Lebanese who participated in the elections to preserve stability and create jobs. He added about the voter turnout, The problem with this election: a lot of people didn't understand it, referring to the new electoral system. \nSamir Geagea, leader of the Christian opposition party Lebanese Forces, said the election results showed a popular ground that would give strength to a coalition known as March 14, which opposes Hezbollah, to fix the path. The March 14 coalition won a parliamentary majority in 2009 and was supported by Saudi Arabia, but the alliance had disbanded, according to Reuters.\nSources: BBC, Reuters, The Washington Post\n",

      "Content": "On Wednesday, the outgoing Iraqi parliament voted to order a manual recount of the 11 million votes cast in the May 12 national election. Parliament also replaced leaders of the election commission and annulled votes of Iraqis who were overseas or displaced. Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi had said on Tuesday that security agencies had evidence of unprecedented voting violations, including issues with electronic vote-counting machines that had not been used before the May 12 election. \nIntelligence services tested the voting machines and the machines produced what Al Jazeera reported to be varied results.\nA committee of Iraqi security and anti-corruption leaders submitted a report on the election and the role of the Independent High Electoral Commission (IHEC) to al-Abadi. The prime minister said Tuesday that at first he planned to let the commission deal with the violations, as there are violations each election, here and there. He changed his mind after the report, saying the security and anti-corruption committee had revealed dangerous things. \nThere may have been some violations by candidates but the election commission bears the largest share of the responsibility, al-Abadi said. Officials in the IHEC had not taken the needed measures or had taken wrong ones, including not checking the vote-counting machines for errors, the prime minister said. \nAl-Abadi prohibited some IHEC officials from leaving the country without permission, and said criminal charges may be brought against some of the officials.\nThe IHEC previously denied there were abnormal violations in this election. It did not immediately respond to Wednesdays decision. \nThe official May 12 election results showed that a coalition between Shiite Muslim cleric Muqtada al-Sadr and other parties had won 54 of the 328 seats in parliament. Another coalition won 47 seats, and al-Abadis coalition came in third with 42 seats. A majority coalition of at least 165 seats is needed to form a new government with a new prime minister. \nAl-Abadi will stay in office until a new prime minister is chosen. Al-Sadr, the leader of the coalition with the most seats prior to the recount, would not be eligible to be the next prime minister under the new government because he did not run in the May 12 elections, according to Al Jazeera.\nThe May election was the first since the Iraqi government declared victory over Islamic State last December. The voter turnout was 44.5 percent.\nSources: Al Jazeera, BBC",

The news outlet said in a statement that it stresses that it will closely watch the developments that may result from the Israeli decision and will take the necessary legal measures towards it.\nKara asked the Government Press Office (GPO) to revoke press passes held by the networks journalists. Al Jazeeras Israeli journalists are members of the Foreign Press Association, and most have government-vetted GPO credentials, The Jerusalem Post reported. Kara said cable television providers have agreed to take the network off the air.\nKara asked Defense Minister Avigdor Liberman to close Al Jazeeras Israeli offices. Kara said he would propose legislation that would allow the government to favor security concerns over freedom of expression in certain circumstances.\n\nSources: Al Jazeera, The Guardian, Jerusalem Post, BBC",

Win Myint, 66, is a lawyer and was the speaker of parliaments lower house until he resigned last week. Parliament selected Win Myint out of three candidates, and he is scheduled to be sworn in on Friday. Kyaw, 71, has been in poor health and the presidencys Facebook page posted that he resigned to take a rest.\nKyaw became president after the National League for Democracy (NLD) party won a majority in parliament in the 2015 elections. After the elections, Aung San Suu Kyi, the leader of the NLD, took the position of state counselor. She was not allowed to serve as president under the countrys constitution, written by the military, because she has children who are not citizens. Win Myint is from the NLD party, as was Kyaw. \nSuu Kyi, 72, won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991 \"for her non-violent struggle for democracy and human rights in Myanmar. The ruling military junta placed her under house arrest in 1989 and released her in 1995.\nFormerly known as Burma, Myanmar was under military rule until democratic elections in 2010, when it became a quasi-civilian government, according to the U.S. State Department. \nMyanmar has experienced violence between Buddhists and Rohingya Muslims.

      "Content": "The Supreme Court recently ruled on two partisan gerrymandering cases. That news may raise the question: what isgerrymandering anyhow? We answer that question and more below.\nWhat is gerrymandering?\nGerrymandering is the act of dividing an area into election districts to give special advantages to one group, as defined by Merriam Webster. This can be done through processes known as packing or cracking when a states congressional districts are redrawn.\nPacking is when a district is drawn so that the electorate includes as many members of the opposing party as possible to limit the number of representatives won by that party in other districts. For example, a district could be packed with people registered with one party so they win that district by far more than the required 50 percent. This would remove those supporters from other districts in the state so those districts are not as competitive, and can be more easily won by the other party. \nCracking is when the opposing partys supporters are spread across multiple districts to dilute their voting power and to make it more difficult to win the most votes in a single district. \nCracking and packing are effective at altering the number of seats each party receives because of the first-past-the-post (FPTP) electoral system. Under FPTP, the candidate in a district who receives the most votes (but not necessarily a majority of votes) wins the seat. Whichever party has the most votes in each district wins that districts seat, regardless of the total percentage of of votes that party won in the state overall. (This is different than a proportional representation system that bases the number of seats a party receives on the percentage of total votes it won.)\nRedrawing congressional districts is not considered gerrymandering unless the district is drawn to deliberately favor one particular group.\nWhat is a congressional district?\nCongressional districts are the 435 areas across the U.S. from which members are elected to the House of Representatives. The number, size and shape of congressional districts in each state varies and can change based on population, as determined by U.S. census data gathered every 10 years. Because of this, states need to adjust their districts to ensure that constituents are adequately represented. Each state is responsible for creating and maintaining its congressional districts.\nEach congressional district is to be as equal in population to all other congressional districts in a state as practicable, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. The boundaries and numbers shown for the congressional districts are those specified in the state laws or court orders establishing the districts within each state.\nWhos in charge?\nRules regulating congressional district boundaries vary by state. In some states, the state legislature controls redistricting. Legislators may vote on a redrawn district in the same manner as any law; and the states governor can elect to veto the change.\nOther states may limit the governors ability to veto district changes. Connecticut, Florida, Maryland, Mississippi, and North Carolina approve district lines by a joint resolution that the governor cannot veto, according to Loyola Law School.\nStates such as Iowa, Maine, New York, Rhode Island, and Vermont appoint advisory commissions to help the legislature redraw or adjust district lines. Commissions may include state legislators, public officials chosen by legislators or people considered unaffiliated or independent of the legislature.\nWhere did the term gerrymandering come from?\nIn February 11, 1812, Massachusetts Governor Elbridge Gerry signed into law a redrawn district that opponents said favored his political party. According to the Library of Congress, Republican legislators redrew voting lines so that the Federalist vote was concentrated in a few districts, while the Republican vote was spread over many. In the following election, the Republican party won 29 seats and the Federalists won 11 seats. After the governor signed the new district into law, editors at the Boston Gazette compared the districts shape to that of a salamander. One of the editors reportedly said, Salamander! Call it a Gerrymander. (The governors last name was actually pronounced with a hard g, like the name Gary, but gerrymander later came to be pronounced with a soft g.)\nIs gerrymandering legal?\nThe constitutionality of adjusting districts based on political affiliation has not been decided. However, the court has ruled that gerrymandering is unconstitutional when districts are drawn based on the race or ethnicity of the areas electorate.\nThe issue of race in redistricting was decided in the case Shaw v. Reno. In 1993, North Carolina sent then-Attorney General Janet Reno a congressional reapportionment plan that created one majority-black district. Reno objected to the new district, arguing that that a second district could have been created to give minority voting strength in the State's south-central to southeastern region. The state then added a second majority-black district that stretched 160 miles along Interstate 85 and about the width of the interstate, according to court documents.\nFive North Carolina residents then sued claiming that the state had created an unconstitutional racial gerrymander. They argued that the districts concentrated black voters arbitrarily without regard to considerations such as compactness, contiguousness, geographical boundaries, or political subdivisions, in order to create congressional districts along racial lines and to assure the election of two black representatives. \nIn a 5-4 decision, the justices ruled in favor of the plaintiffs. The court said that the plaintiffs had standing under the Equal Protection Clause of the constitution, which, among other things, prevents states from discriminating against people based on race. The court ruled that North Carolinas redistricting rationally cannot be understood as anything other than an effort to separate voters into different districts on the basis of race, and that the separation lacks sufficient justification.",

      "Content": "The European Union (EU) is a body that currently includes 28 countries, known as member states. When a country joins the EU, its representatives agree to divert some of their decision-making powers to EU institutions. In exchange, countries receive benefits, including access to free trade.\nEU laws supercede laws of member states for areas in which the EU has jurisdiction, such as agriculture, fisheries and transport. The EU Commission can propose new laws that the Parliament and Council can decide to adopt. Then, member states and the EU Commission implement the new laws. EU citizens can also elect members of the Parliament, and qualifying member states can use the official EU currency, the euro. \nBrief EU history\nThe EU was created in 1951, after World War II, and was aimed at preventing neighboring countries from going to war. The EU began with an alliance among Belgium, Germany, France, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands. \nThe participating members established trade agreements and removed customs duties. By the 1960s, member states also agreed to have joint control over food production to reduce supply shortages among EU citizens.\nBetween 1973 and 2013, an additional 22 member states joined the union, with Croatia being the most recent country added. However, the U.K. is scheduled to leave the EU at 11 p.m. U.K. time on March 29, 2019, after voting in a referendum to exit the union in 2016. The U.K. would be the first country to leave the EU, though it could return at a later date if it still incorporated the unions regulations and laws.\nThe Euro\nThe EU has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the 28 member countries. The group of countries that use it is known as the euro zone. Countries such as the U.K. and Denmark didnt adopt the euro. The EU also has a single marketplace in which all members can exchange goods and services without paying tariffs. \nEU member states must meet certain economic and legal standards known as the Maastricht criteria to be a part of the euro zone. The Maastricht criteria includes rules on inflation, budget deficits limits, national debt, interest rates and exchange rates.\nCitizens within the EU can move freely between member states.\nEU Parliament\nThe EU Parliament has 751 MEPs, or Members of the European Parliament, elected directly by the citizens of EU member states every five years. The last election was held in 2014. \nMEPs elect a president for a renewable term of 2-1/2 years. The president represents EU Parliament internationally, oversees members work, and signs budgetary and legislative acts adopted by parliament.\nThe parliament has three primary functions: 1) passing EU laws and deciding on other international agreements and legislation; 2) supervising EU institutions such as banks, and reviewing petitions or inquiries posed by its citizens; and 3) managing the unions budget. The parliament also includes at least 20 committees that focus on specific issues, such as human rights, international trade, and transportation.\nMEPs are grouped by political affiliation, not by country. Parliament currently has MEPs representing nine political parties. With 218 MEPs, the European Peoples Party (EPP) is the largest political group in parliament. According to parliamentary rules, no EU country can have fewer than six or more than 96 MEPs, and the total number cannot exceed 751, including the president.\nTreaty on European Union\nThe Treaty on European Union, also called the Treaty of Maastricht, named for the Dutch city, forms the constitution of the EU and outlines principles of the union. Article 9, for example, says, the Union shall observe the principle of the equality of its citizens, who shall receive equal attention from its institutions, bodies, offices and agencies. \nArticle 7 of the treaty was designed to prevent member states from enacting laws or policies that went against the democratic principles on which the EU was founded. The article allows parliament or the EU Commission to determine whether there is a clear risk of a serious breach by a member state of the values referred to in Article 2 of the treaty by questioning the member state and reviewing evidence against them. Article 2 values include: human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to minorities.\nA member state and parliament can attempt to remedy any alleged breaches. If the member state is found to continue to not comply with EU values, it may have certain rights suspended, such as the ability to vote on EU laws in parliament.\n\n\nSources: Article 2, Article 7, BBC Brexit, DW on article 7, EU member list, EU history, EU law, EU law monitor, Euro currency, EU Parliament, EU political breakdown, EU president, Maastricht Criteria",

He also said he had great confidence in U.S. intelligence agencies. \nLast year, the CIA and FBI assessed with high confidence that Putin ordered an influence campaign into the 2016 election, and NSA assessed it with moderate confidence. \nPutin said at the conference the U.S. could ask Russia, under a 1999 agreement, to interrogate 12 Russian military officers who were indicted in the U.S. last week for allegedly hacking into the Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee and releasing stolen emails. He said the U.S. could request to be present at the interrogation. He was responding to a question about whether Russia would extradite the officers to the U.S. \nPutin said Russia would expect the U.S. to cooperate similarly in a Russian investigation of an American-British investor, William Browder, who is in the U.S. and is accused of financial crimes in Russia. Browder had lobbied for U.S. legislation that sanctioned Russian officials suspected of human rights abuses, following the death of Browders lawyer. \nTrump said it was an incredible offer to allow the countries intelligence forces to work together on the investigation into alleged cyber attacks. \nPutin, when asked, said he favored Trump in the election. Yes, I wanted him to win because he spoke of normalization of Russian-U.S. ties, Putin said. Putin also called the allegation that he had compromising information collected on Trump sheer nonsense, and had not known Trump was in Moscow prior to the election. Do you really believe that we try to shadow every businessman? asked the president, a former KGB member. \nOn Tuesday, Trump told reporters at the White House, I accept our intelligence community's conclusion that Russia's meddling in the 2016 election took place, adding, it could be other people also. A lot of people out there. \nI dont see any reason why it wouldnt be Russia, Trump said Tuesday, saying his comment needed some \"clarification.\" He said he initially intended to say \"wouldn't\" instead of \"would,\" and hoped that would be \"obvious.\" He added, \"We are doing everything in our power to prevent Russian interference in 2018.\"\nOther topics discussed\nAt Monday's press conference, Putin said Trumps efforts toward North Korean denuclearization were good, and attributed it to Trump personally becoming involved in the resolution, building dialogue in the spirit of cooperation, not confrontation.\nThe leaders also said they are examining ways to protect Israel from conflict along its Syrian border, without stating any specific measures. In the Syrian war, Russia supports Syrian President Bashar Assads government, the U.S. has supported certain rebel groups, and both countries have fought the Islamic State. \nWe also discussed at length the crisis in Syria, Trump said. Cooperation between our countries has the potential to save hundreds of thousands of lives. \nTrump called Putin a competitor, which he said was a compliment, and mentioned that the U.S. and Russia compete in the energy market. \nAt the press conference, Trump did not mention the topic of the Russian annexation of Crimea from Ukraine. Putin said Trumps position on the topic was well-known, and that as far as we, the Russian Federation, are concerned, this issue is off the table.\nTrump and Putins comments were made at a press conference after a summit in Finlands capital city, attended only by Putin, Trump and translators. The meeting was originally scheduled for 90 minutes, according to the White House, and lasted more than two hours. \nPrior to the meeting, Trump thanked his Finnish counterpart, President Sauli Niinist, for hosting the summit and for his commitment to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. NATO members met in Brussels last week and committed to improving the balance of sharing the costs and responsibilities of alliance membership.\nThe U.S. president left Helsinki on Monday evening local time, and is scheduled to visit Joint Base Andrews, an air base in Maryland, before returning to Washington.\nResponse to the meeting\nFollowing the Putin-Trump news conference, U.S. Speaker of the House Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) said Trump must appreciate that Russia is not our ally. The Speaker added, There is no question that Russia interfered in our election and continues attempts to undermine democracy here and around the world. Ryan, in his role in the House, has attended briefings by U.S. intelligence personnel on the alleged interference. \nRussian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said the bilateral talks went better than super, Russian media reported. \n\nSources: AP, CNN, Intelligence report, TASS, TASS, The Hill",

The Justice Department filed a notice of appeal with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and said it plans to file a petition with the Supreme Court later this week, asking for a direct review of the ruling.\nLast week, San Francisco-based Federal District Judge William Alsup ruled that lawsuits from California and other states were likely to succeed on the merits of their claim that the Trump administrations efforts to end DACA were arbitrary and capricious. The ruling stated the administration must continue accepting DACA renewals nationwide, but it does not need to receive or process new applications. On Saturday, the administration resumed accepting renewal requests, citing Alsups ruling.\nIn the Justice Departments press release, Attorney General Jeff Sessions said, \"It defies both law and common sense for DACA  to somehow be mandated nationwide by a single district court in San Francisco\nThe DACA program protects immigrants who illegally entered the U.S. as children from deportation. DACA was established in 2012 during the Obama administration, and has around 700,000 participants. In September last year, President Donald Trump announced an end to the program starting in March 2018.\n\nFor more information about what DACA is, click here.\nSources: CNN, Fox News, The Washington Post",

      "Content": "Martin Shkreli, a former hedge fund manager and pharmaceutical company CEO, was sentenced to seven years in prison for federal securities fraud on Friday. He was also fined $75,000 in a ruling by U.S. District Judge Kiyo Matsumoto. Earlier this week, Matsumoto had ruled Shkreli would forfeit more than $7.3 million in a brokerage account and personal assets. Shkreli apologized to his investors, saying, I am terribly sorry I lost your trust.\nFraud trial\nShkreli, 34, was arrested by the FBI in Dec. 2015 on fraud charges. On Aug. 4, 2017, a jury found him guilty of three charges: securities fraud in connection with MSMB Capital, securities fraud in connection with MSMB Healthcare and conspiracy to commit securities fraud in connection with Retrophin. He was also found not guilty of five charges.\nIn September 2017, Matsumoto revoked Shkrelis $5 million bail for posting online that he would pay $5,000 per hair obtained from Hillary Clinton. The defense said it was a joke, but Matsumoto ruled it could be seen as a solicitation of an assault. Shkreli was sent to a federal jail in Brooklyn.\nThe time Shkreli spent in prison will be credited to his seven-year sentence. The prosecutors had sought a 15 year sentence. The minimum sentence for Shkrelis crimes is 18 months.\nWho is Shkreli? \nShkreli began working on Wall Street at age 17 before establishing his own hedge fund at age 23. He later taught himself biology and co-founded a biotechnology firm, Retrophin Inc. After leaving Retrophin, he founded another biotech company called Turing Pharmaceuticals. \nTuring Pharmaceuticals purchased the rights to manufacture and sell the drug Daraprim, which is the only FDA-approved treatment for toxoplasmosis infection, according to The Guardian. Some people, including some AIDS patients, cancer patients and in utero fetuses, are at risk of dying due to toxoplasmosis infection. \nShkreli received media attention when the company raised the retail price of Daraprim from $13.50 to $750 per pill. A House of Representatives oversight committee also subpoenaed Shkreli in 2016 as part of an investigation into accusations of profiteering. Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md) said Turing earned $98 million in revenue from the drug, while it cost the company $1 million to manufacture. \nAt the hearing, Shkreli invoked the fifth amendment, which gives people the right to avoid self-incrimination. The House committee investigation was unrelated to the fraud charges. \nSources: ABC News, Associated Press, Associated Press, Los Angeles Times, NPR, The Guardian, The Washington Post",

Van der Zwaan pleaded guilty to the charges, which do not involve alleged Russian interference in the 2016 election. Van der Zwaan was accused of making the false statements during an interview with investigators regarding work he did in 2012 for the Ukrainian government, according to court documents.\nGates, along with former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort, were indicted by Mueller in October on charges related to political consulting they did in the Ukraine. Manafort and Gates pleaded not guilty to the charges. The indictment cited a 2012 report that was produced for the Ukrainian government by van der Zwaans firm. According to Ukrainian court documents, Manafort worked to set up the contract between Ukraine and the law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher  Flom LLP. In November, prosecutors questioned van der Zwaan about the 2012 report. It was during this interview that van der Zwaan allegedly lied about his communication with Gates.\nMueller on Tuesday released a two-page indictment which said van der Zwaan told the FBI his last contact with Gates was in Aug. 2016, and that his last communication with an unidentified Person A was in 2014. The FBI alleges van der Zwaans last contact with both people was in Sep. 2016. Van der Zwaan also allegedly told the FBI he didn't know why an email he had written to \"Person A\" in Sep. 2016 had not been passed to Mueller's office. The indictment said van der Zwaan deleted and otherwise did not produce emails sought by Mueller's office, including the email with \"Person A.\"\nVan der Zwaans sentencing is scheduled for April 3. Sentencing could include prison time of up to six months and a fine as high as $9,500. His former law firm said on Tuesday it had fired van der Zwaan last year and is cooperating with authorities.\nVan der Zwaan is a Dutch national and is the son-in-law of Russian billionaire German Khan.\nSources: AP, BBC, CNN, Fox News, The New York Times",

Of the 350 Members of Parliament (MPs), 180 voted for no confidence, 169 voted against, and one abstained. Pedro Snchez, leader of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE), filed the confidence motion after former members of Rajoys party were convicted on corruption-related charges. Rajoy himself has not been accused of wrongdoing.\nBecause Snchez filed the confidence motion and received a parliamentary majority, his party must be prepared to govern and fill the role of prime minister, according to Spains constitution. Snchez is expected to take office, according to BBC and CNN.\nRajoy, 63, has been prime minister since 2011. Snchez said Rajoy did not take responsibility for the PPs involvement in corruption offenses. Last week, the party was fined after a Spanish court ruled it had benefited from receiving bribes. The court also sentenced one of the PPs former treasurers, Luis Brcenas, to 33 years in prison after being convicted of receiving bribes, money laundering and tax crimes. He was one of 38 defendants in the case, code-named Grtel. In addition to Brcenas, 27 other people were found guilty and given prison sentences, while eight were acquitted. Rajoy was called to testify against his own party members in the case. He has not been personally accused of any crime.\nRajoy spoke to parliament before the vote, saying, In light of what we all know, I presume that the vote of no confidence will go ahead, and Pedro Snchez will become the Prime Minister and I want to be the first to congratulate him.\nIt has been an honor to leave Spain better than I found it. Thank you to all Spaniards and good luck, he said.\nSnchez posted on Twitter, saying, \"Spain starts a new page. A period to recover the dignity of its institutions. From responsibility, dialogue and consensus, it is time to work for equality, to build a country that does not leave anyone behind.\" \nSnchez, 46, became leader of the PSOE in 2014 and resigned in 2016. In 2017, he won the PSOE primary. His party holds 84 seats in Spains lower house and will need support from other parties to pass legislation. Snchez does not hold a seat in parliament.\nSources: BBC, CNN, The Guardian, The Washington Post",

      "Content": "On Tuesday, authorities detained former French President Nicolas Sarkozy for questioning about campaign contributions he allegedly received from the late Libyan leader Colonel Muammar Gaddafi for the 2007 French presidential campaign. Police have previously questioned Sarkozy in the case and he has denied wrongdoing. Sarkozy, 63, is being held in Nanterre, west of Paris. BBC reported that he may be held up to 48 hours under French law.\nSarkozys Republicans party said they support him and reminded people about the principle of the presumption of innocence that is valid for everyone.\nAFP reported that authorities also questioned Brice Hortefeux, who was senior minister during Sarkozys one term as president from 2008 to 2012.\nIn November 2016, French news outlet Mediapart reported that Ziad Takieddine, a Franco-Lebanese businessman, had said that between 2006 and 2007 he had given a total of 5 million euros ($6.2 million) in cash from the Libyan government to Sarkozy and his chief of staff, Claude Guant. The money was allegedly given in three suitcases. Guant denied receiving Libyan campaign financing. \nMediapart also published a document in 2012 that allegedly showed that Gaddafi agreed to contribute 50 million euros ($62 million) to Sarkozys campaign. The document was allegedly signed by Libyas intelligence chief at the time. Sarkozy sued Mediapart for forgery over the document. According to Mediapart, he lost the case.\nGaddafis son, Seif al-Islam, has also alleged that Sarkozy received money from Libya for his presidential campaign and asked that the money be returned. Sarkozy said the former Libyan leadership made the allegations because Frances military had intervened in Libya and aided in ending Gaddafis rule.\nInvestigators are reportedly looking into the two media reports by Mediapart, in addition to a cash transfer of 500,000 euros to Guant that he says was for the sale of two paintings.\nSarkozy was detained in 2014 as part of a separate investigation into alleged campaign funding violations. Separate investigations into alleged secret funding of his 2007 presidential campaign and allegations of trying to influence investigators did not lead to charges, according to BBC. \nSarkozy has been ordered to stand trial in a separate case for alleged illicit campaign financing during his unsuccessful 2012 re-election campaign. Prosecutors said that Sarkozy spent approximately double the 22.5 million euros ($24 million) limit that is allowed by law during that campaign. They also alleged that Bygmalion, a public relations firm used by Sarkozy, engaged in false billing during the campaign. Sarkozy said he did not know about the false billing. \nGaddafi, who died in 2011, visited Paris in 2007, and made arms and nuclear energy deals with France, AFP reported. Gaddafi ruled Libya for more than 40 years.\nSources: AFP, BBC",

      "Content": "U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced on Friday that the Department of Justice (DOJ) has proposed that the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) classify bump stocks as machine guns under federal law, which would effectively ban them. Bump stocks are devices that allow a semiautomatic firearm to initiate a continuous firing cycle with a single pull of the trigger, similar to an automatic firearm. \nLater on Friday, President Donald Trump said he would ban bump stocks himself if Congress does not ban them through legislation. He also called for other measures, including the ability to institutionalize people who are suspected of becoming violent, common sense background checks for gun purchases, and the arming of teache\nA bump stock device was used in the Oct. 1, 2017 Las Vegas shooting that killed 58 people. In February of this year, Trump sent a memo to Sessions directing him to implement new federal guidelines banning bump stocks very soon. While announcing the proposal, Sessions said that since the Vegas shooting, banning bump stocks is a critical step in our effort to reduce the threat of gun violence that is in keeping with the Constitution and the laws passed by Congress.\nThe proposal will now be sent to public comment for a period of 90 days. (Instructions for submitting public comments are available here.)\nIn 2010, the ATF concluded that bump stocks did not turn a gun into a semi-automatic or machinegun, which meant they were not prohibited under the National Firearms Act of 1934. The ATF determined at that time that it could not regulate bump stocks without Congress passing a new law. \nSen. Diane Feinstein (D-Calif.) has called for legislation to ban bump stocks, arguing that the AFT would not have the legal authority to do so. If ATF tries to ban these devices after admitting repeatedly that it lacks the authority to do so, that process could be tied up in court for years, and that would mean bump stocks would continue to be sold, the senator has said.\nTrumps press conference\nAt a press conference, Trump said he wanted to discuss public safety at schools and in general, adding that after the shooting at a Florida school we need to turn our grief into action. Trump said he would prohibit bump stocks himself even if Congress does not legislate them. He also repeated support for arming some teachers, noting that schools would not be able to hire enough security guards. \nTrump said that in the old days we had mental institutions and you could nab somebody like the alleged Florida school shooter, when authorities or family members notice signs indicating the potential for violence. Trump said such institutions were closed due to cost, and called to explore reopening them as a halfway between prison and leaving him at his house.\nThe president also said he met with leaders of the National Rifle Association recently and said the NRA wanted to do something. He made the comment in the context of introducing more extensive background checks for gun purchases. Trump also said the NRA members are doing what they think is right, though we have to fight the NRA every once in a while. \nTrump noted that senators were already working on legislation, and said they were going to strengthen it.\nSources: DOJ Press Release, ABC News, Fox News",

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said these entities jeopardize the safety and security of the U.S. because they have directly contributed to improving Russias cyber and underwater capabilities through their work with Russias Federal Security Service (FSB).\n \n The OFAC press release said Russias activities include the 2017 NotPetya cyber malware attack, cyber intrusions against the U.S. energy grid, and tracking undersea communications cables that carry the majority of the worlds telecommunications data.\nThe NotPetya cyber-attack, in June 2017, was a mock ransomware virus that damaged hard drive files. It affected computer systems of banks, energy firms, government officials, hospitals and an airport in Kiev, Ukraine. According to cybersecurity firm Cybereason, it cost an estimated $1.2 billion worldwide in lost revenue to companies; other estimates are higher. Russia has denied responsibility for NotPetya.\nThe sanctioned Russian entities and individuals were designated under Executive Order 13694, Blocking the Property of Certain Persons Engaging in Significant Malicious Cyber-Enabled Activities. \nThe entities and individuals are:\n\n\tDigital Security, which the U.S. says provided material and technological support to the FSB.\n\tERPScan, a subsidiary of Digital Security.\n\tEmbedi, owned or controlled by Digital Security.\n\tKvant Scientific Research Institute, owned or controlled by FSB.\n\tDivetechnoservices, which obtained underwater equipment and diving systems for the FSB, according to the U.S.\n\tAleksandr Lvovich Tribun, General Director of Divetechnoservices.\n\tOleg Sergeyevich Chirikov, Program Manager of Divetechnoservices.\n\tVladimir Yakovlevich Kaganskiy, Owner of Divetechnoservices.\n\nThe sanctions freeze any property or assets owned by the entities or individuals that are subject to U.S. jurisdiction, and generally prohibit U.S. persons from engaging in transactions with them. \nIn March, the department sanctioned five entities and 19 individuals for alleged malign Russian cyber activity, including NotPetya. In April, the Treasury Department imposed sanctions on 17 Russian government officials, 12 companies and a state-owned weapons trading company and its subsidiary bank.\nSources: Treasury Press Release, CNN, Los Angeles Times, The Washington Post, RT",

      "Content": "French President Emmanuel Macron addressed a joint session of the U.S. Congress on Wednesday, at the end of a three-day visit to the U.S. He spoke about the Iran nuclear deal, the Paris Agreement on climate change, multilateralism, the April joint airstrike on Syria, civil rights, digital privacy, fake news, and more. \nIran deal\nSpeaking about the 2015 nuclear agreement, under which Iran agreed to limit its nuclear program in exchange for reduced economic sanctions, Macron said it may not address all concerns and very important concerns. But we should not abandon it without having something substantial and more substantial instead. He added, Our objective is clear: Iran shall never possess any nuclear weapons. \nIn October of last year, President Donald Trump had allowed a deadline to pass without recertifying Irans compliance with the deal. Later that month, the U.S. House of Representatives voted in favor of new sanctions on Iran in response to its ballistic missile program. Trump has set a deadline of May 12 to either renegotiate and fix the agreement or withdraw from it. \nClimate\nMacron spoke about carbon emissions during his address, saying, I am sure one day the U.S. will come back and join the Paris agreement. He added, We must find a smoother transition to a lower carbon economy. \nTrump announced the U.S. would withdraw from the agreement in June of last year. The accord called on nations to set voluntary goals to reduce carbon emissions with a stated goal of preventing the average global temperature from increasing 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit (2 Celsius) above pre-industrial levels.\nNationalism in the New World Order\nIn his speech, Macron said, The 21st century has brought a series of new threats and new challenges that our ancestors might not ever have imagined. Our strongest challenges are unknown New World Order. \nThe international community needs to step up [its] game and build the 21st century world order based on the perennial principles we established together after World War II, he said. The rule of law, the fundamental values which we secured peace for 70 years are now questioned by urgent issues that require our joint action. \nMacron said the world faces inequalities created by globalization, threats to the planet, our common good, attacks on democracy  and the destabilization of our international community by new powers and criminal states. \nHe said that in response to the problems and fear of the 21st century, we can choose isolationism, withdrawal and nationalism but closing the door to the world will not stop the evolution of the world.\nMacron said the U.S. invented this multilateralism, and its the one now who has to help preserve and reinvent it, and this would be decisive for creating and safeguarding this free world. He cited the recent joint strike by the U.S., Britain and France on alleged Syrian chemical weapons facilities as evidence of multilateralism.\nOther topics\nOn the subject of digital privacy, Macron mentioned a data protection law passed by the EU and said he believed the U.S. and EU should cooperate to find the right balance between innovation and ethics.\nMacron also said, to protect our democracies, we have to fight against the ever growing virus of fake news which exposes our people to irrational fear and imaginary risk.\nWe have shared the history of civil rights, Macron said of the U.S. and France, mentioning womens rights and saying that explains why the #MeToo movement has a deep resonance in France.\nPrior to Macron, seven French presidents have addressed a joint meeting of the U.S. Congress, according to House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.). Macrons speech came on the anniversary of French President Charles de Gaulles address to a joint session of Congress in 1960.\nSources: CNN, C-SPAN, Reuters, The New York Times",

      "Content": "On Thursday, U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued a memorandum that rescinded five Department of Justice (DOJ) memos from the Obama administration on the prosecution of marijuana-related offenses. Some of the rescinded memos had deprioritized the prosecution of marijuana violations in states that had legalized medical or recreational marijuana sales, or when the offense was unrelated to other federal law priorities.\nMarijuana use remains illegal under federal law. It has been legalized or decriminalized for medical or recreational purposes under some state laws. \nThe DOJ statement said rescinding the memos was a return of local control to federal prosecutors. Sessions said, todays memo on federal marijuana enforcement directs U.S. Attorneys to use previously established prosecutorial principles that provide them all the necessary tools to disrupt criminal organizations, tackle the growing drug crisis, and thwart violent crime across our country. The DOJ described it as a return to the rule of law.\nThe five rescinded memos were written between 2009 and 2014. James M. Cole, then-Deputy Attorney General, issued two of those memos to all U.S. attorneys: the Guidance Regarding Marijuana Enforcement on Aug. 29, 2013, and the Guidance Regarding Marijuana Related Financial Crimes on Feb. 14, 2014. Two more of the memos, dated 2009 and 2011, was related to medical marijuana. The final memo, dated 2014, dealt with marijuana in Indian Country. \nThere is parallel guidance from the Treasury Department to the 2014 DOJ memo on financial crimes, Politico reported. That guidance, which remains in place, relates to the deprioritization of prosecution of banks that do business with marijuana sellers who comply with state laws.\nAccording to nonprofit organization NORML, whose mission includes legalizing the responsible use of marijuana by adults, eight states and the District of Columbia have laws legalizing personal marijuana use, and an additional 14 states have laws decriminalizing its use. \nSources: Politico, The Washington Post",

The courts decision was unanimous. Puigdemont left Spain for Belgium in October last year, after Spain dissolved Catalans parliament following its declaration of independence.\nPuigdemont is currently the only candidate proposed for the Catalan presidency. The Catalan parliament is due to vote for a new president on Tuesday.\nThe Constitutional Court also said it would decide whether it would accept the governments request to challenge the legitimacy of Puigdemonts candidacy once it had spoken to all parties concerned. Under Spanish law, if the court accepts the request, Puigdemonts candidacy will be suspended while the court deliberates its legitimacy.\nAfter an independence referendum on Oct. 1, which a Spanish court ruled unconstitutional, Puigdemont declared Catalan independence from Spain. As a result, the Spanish government brought charges of sedition and rebellion against Puigdemont and other Catalan lawmakers. If convicted of these charges, Puigdemont could be sentenced to as many as 30 years in prison.\nAfter imposing direct rule in Catalonia, the Spanish government called for a new election for the regional parliament on Dec. 20. Independence supporters won a majority in this election. Puigdemonts party, Junts per Catalunya (Together for Catalonia), said on Saturday that there was no legal basis to bar him from being president. His supporters have argued he could rule remotely from Brussels using video link technology.\nSources: BBC, Reuters",

The National Weather Service forecast the winds to increase in speed on Thursday, before lessening Friday and Saturday. Chief Ken Pimlott of Cal Fire said gusts could be up to 80 miles per hour (129 km/h).\n\nSources: The Los Angeles Times, The New York Times, The New York Times #2",

      "Content": "The U.S. House of Representatives on Tuesday passed a bill to modify regulations placed on the banking industry by the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act. Under the new bill, the asset threshold at which banks and other financial companies will be automatically required to perform a stress test at least annually would be increased from $10 billion to $250 billion. \nCompanies with assets between $100 and $250 billion would still be subject to periodic stress tests at the discretion of the governing body. Stress tests examine how a company might fare in a financial downturn. \nThe House voted 258-159 on a version of the bill, called the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, after the Senate passed a version by a vote of 67-31 in March. The two bills must be reconciled and signed by the president before becoming law. \nThe new bill also exempts banks with less than $10 billion in assets from the Volcker rule, which currently prohibits them from proprietary trading and from making certain investments in hedge funds and private-equity funds. \nThe bill also reduces some home mortgage regulations and reporting requirements. \nWhite House officials said President Donald Trump would sign the Republican-drafted bill, which 33 House Democrats and 17 Senate Democrats had voted for along with Republicans. \nDodd-Frank Act\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act passed after the economic recession of 2008 to promote the financial stability of the U.S. Its goals are to improve accountability and transparency in the financial system, to end too big to fail, to protect the American taxpayer by ending bailouts, to protect consumers from abusive financial services practices, and for other purposes. The concept of too big to fail refers to when a given company has become so large that a government will provide assistance to prevent its failure because not doing so would have a disastrous ripple effect throughout the economy, according to Investopedia.\nThe number of banks subject to the Dodd-Frank regulations under the new bill would decrease from 38 to 12, according to The Washington Post. Institutions such as JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo would still be subject to the original Dodd-Frank regulations, NPR reported.\nThe new bill also leaves intact other elements of the Dodd-Frank Act, including the establishment of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.",

Zia, the current head of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), was convicted of stealing 21 million taka ($253,000) while prime minister from 2001 to 2006. She, along with her son and four aides, were charged with stealing foreign donations received by an orphanage trust she had created. Zia, 72, has denied the charges, and her attorney said she will appeal the verdict.\nDemonstrators in the capital city of Dhaka and other cities protested the charges. Police used tear gas and rubber bullets in the northeastern city of Sylhet to disperse protesters. Media outlets broadcast images of motorcycles on fire. According to a BNP spokesman, about 3,500 opposition activists and officials were arrested during the protest.\nThe BNP secretary general said the case was politically motivated, calling it false and staged. Human Rights Watch director Brad Adams said the Bangladeshi government is trying to stop political dissent and asked that it cease arbitrary arrests and detentions.\nBangladeshi Law Minister Anisul Hug said Zias conviction proves that no one is above the law.\nZia is scheduled to run in parliamentary polls in December. She may still run for office if an appeal is pending at the time, The Guardian reported.\nSources: Reuters, The Guardian",

      "Content": "A South Korean court sentenced former President Park Geun-hye to 24 years in prison on Friday after being found guilty of charges related to corruption. The Seoul Central District Court also fined Park 18 billion won ($16.9 million). Park has denied wrongdoing and said she would appeal her sentence. \nPark was found guilty of 16 of the 18 charges brought against her, mostly related to abuse of power, coercion and bribery. Prosecutors alleged that Park conspired with her friend Choi Soon-sil to influence companies, including Samsung and retail company Lotte Group, to donate to foundations controlled by Choi. Park was accused last year of receiving 59.2 billion won ($52.1 million) in bribes from several companies. Park was also convicted of leaking 47 confidential presidential documents to Choi, who had no political credentials. Park has known Choi since the 1970s.\nKim Se-yoon, the sentencing judge, said during the hearing, the defendant abused her presidential power entrusted by the people, and as a result, brought massive chaos to the order of state affairs and led to the impeachment of the president, which was unprecedented. Kim said Park had not shown any sign of repentance, and had attempted to say Choi and her secretaries were responsible. We cannot help but sternly hold her accountable, the judge said.\nProsecutors had asked the court to sentence Park to 30 years and fine her 118.5 billion won ($112 million).\nThe sentencing was broadcast live in South Korea; the court cited public interest in the case for the decision to televise the hearing. Park was not in attendance at the Friday hearing. She has boycotted her trial hearings, BBC reported, alleging the court is biased against her.\nAs many as a thousand people gathered outside the courthouse to support Park, Reuters reported, including some who held signs that called her conviction political revenge.\nBackground\nPark, 66, is the daughter of former President Park Chung-hee, who was killed in office in 1979. She reentered politics in the 1990s and later ran for the presidency. She took office in 2013 as the countrys first female leader.\nIn 2016, protests called for her removal from office as she was being investigated for corruption. In December of that year, South Koreas National Assembly voted to impeach her. Then on March 10, 2017, the Constitutional Court upheld that decision. The ruling meant Park had to leave office and lost her immunity from prosecution. Park is the first democratically elected South Korean president to be impeached.\nPark was arrested on March 31, 2017, and has been in jail since then. \nSouth Korea elected Moon Jae-in as its new president in May of last year.\nRelated cases \nThe Seoul Central District Prosecutors Office said in April of last year that it had investigated 110 people regarding the alleged bribery involving Choi and Park.\nChoi, Parks friend, was convicted in a separate trial and sentenced in February to 20 years in prison.\nShin Dong-bin, the chairman of the Lotte Group, the countrys fifth largest retailer, was sentenced to two years and six months. \nLee Jae-yong, also known as Jay Y. Lee, a leader and heir to the Samsung Group, was originally sentenced to five years in jail last August. In February, some of his convictions were overturned and the sentence was reduced to two-and-a-half years. The court suspended his sentence for four years, and he was released from jail in the interim.\nSources: AP, BBC, Reuters, The Korea Times",

The State Department announced on Friday that the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) cannot operate an office in Washington if Palestinians attempt to have the International Criminal Court (ICC) prosecute Israelis for crimes against Palestinians. According to anonymous State Department officials, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson determined that the Palestinians had done so at the United Nations in September when Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas called on the court to investigate Israelis.\nThe U.S. does not recognize the Palestinian territories as a state, but has allowed the PLO, which formally represents Palestinians, to maintain a diplomatic mission in the U.S. since 1994. U.S. law contains a provision that prohibits the PLO from operating the office if it supports the ICC investigating and prosecuting Israelis for alleged crimes against Palestinians, the Associated Press reports. The law allows the mission to remain open if Palestinians are engaged in direct and meaningful negotiations with Israel. It does not specify what it determines to be direct and meaningful. U.S. President Donald Trump now has 90 days to determine if the Palestinians are engaged in such dialogue.\nSenior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said Palestinians will put on hold all our communications with this American administration if the decision moves forward. Erekat said the decision was the result of Israeli pressure on the U.S., and called it unacceptable.\nThe Trump administration did not immediately respond. Prior to the PLO response, U.S. officials had said the decision was a matter of law and was not intended to increase leverage over Palestinians in negotiations towards peace with Israel.\nPalestinian Foreign Minister Riyad al-Maliki said the U.S. had told him that the State Department would meet with legal teams on Monday to decide how the decision would affect the Palestinians diplomatic office in Washington, the diplomats and contact with Palestinians. \nSources: AP, NPR",

      "Content": "California became the first state to eliminate cash bail on Tuesday when Gov. Jerry Brown signed into law the California Money Bail Reform Act, which would replace the states current system. The law is scheduled to go into effect on Oct. 1, 2019. \nThe law would establish a new system for determining a defendants custody status while they await trial. Under the previous system, the person could not leave jail prior to trial unless he or she paid the bail amount set by a judge. Activists claimed this system disproportionately affected lower-income people who could not afford to pay bail, potentially resulting in loss of employment and other financial hardships as they awaited trial.\nUnder the new law, a defendants potential risk to the public and probability of missing a court date would be the primary determining factor when considering whether to jail them until trial, instead of their ability to pay cash bail.\nToday, California reforms its bail system so that rich and poor alike are treated fairly, said Brown.\nBrown, California Chief Justice Tani Cantil-Sakauye and the bills authors, Sen. Robert Hertzberg (D-Los Angeles) and Assemblymember Rob Bonta (D-Alameda), worked together to pass the law.\nAbolishing money bail and replacing it with a risk-based system will enhance justice and safety, Bonta said. For too long, our system has allowed the wealthy to purchase their freedom regardless of their risk, while the poor who pose no danger languish in jail. No more. Freedom and liberty should never be pay to play.\nCalifornias American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) branch said the bill didnt guarantee fairness in the pretrial system. We are disappointed to see Senate Bill 10 signed into law. SB 10 is not the model for pretrial justice and racial equity that California should strive for. It cannot guarantee a substantial reduction in the number of Californians detained while awaiting trial, nor does it sufficiently address racial bias in pretrial decision making, the ACLU said in a statement.\nThe law, also known as Senate Bill 10, passed with a vote of 26-12 in the State Senate, and by 42-31 in the General Assembly.\n\nSources: ACLU California, CNN, Calif.

The FTCs confirmation follows media reports and statements from Facebook that it suspended the accounts of the data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica after it reportedly violated the social media companys policies, receiving data from 50 millions users. \nRead more about Cambridge Analyticas reported violations here, and an update on steps Facebook says it has taken to address the situation here.\nFacebooks CEO Mark Zuckerberg apologized to the public for the incident, calling it a breach of trust, and saying he was sorry we didnt do more at the time. He said Facebook was taking steps to make sure this doesnt happen again.\nThe acting director of the FTCs Bureau of Consumer Protection, Tom Pahl, said the commission is firmly and fully committed to using all of its tools to protect the privacy of consumers, including enforcement action against companies that fail to honor their privacy promises or engage in acts that cause substantial injury to consumers in violation of the FTC Act.\nSenate committee hearing\nAlso on Monday, the chairman for the Senate Judiciary Committee announced it had summoned Zuckerberg to testify before Congress on data privacy. The chairman, Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), said Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey were also called to testify at the hearing, which is scheduled for April 10.\nThe hearing will be on the future of data privacy in social media, and will include questions about privacy standards for how social media networks collect data and distribute it to third-party groups, and what steps the companies have taken to protect user data.\nOn Tuesday, Zuckerberg agreed to testify before Congress, according to unnamed sources cited by The New York Times.\nTwo other U.S. Congressional committees, the House Energy and Commerce Committee and the Senate Commerce Committee, had previously called on Zuckerberg to testify at hearings. \nAdditionally on Monday, a bipartisan group of 37 state attorneys general sent a letter to Facebook inquiring about the companys role in Cambridge Analyticas activities and how this would affect the protection of data in the future. \nFacebook collecting call and text data\nOn Saturday, two days prior to the FTC and Congressional announcements, tech news outlet Ars Technica first reported that Facebook was collecting call and text message information from some Android smartphones that had the Facebook app on them. This information included call times, call duration, and the names of phone numbers of people called or texted.\nFacebook said in a statement on Sunday following the report that the data collection was an opt-in feature for people using Messenger or Facebook Lite on Android. Users are given the option to continuously upload contacts as well as call and text history when logging in for the first time, and that they are given the option to accept, decline or learn more. The statement specified that the feature does not collect the content of your calls or text messages, and can be discontinued at any point.\nA Facebook representative told Ars, The most important part of apps and services that help you make connections is to make it easy to find the people you want to connect with. So, the first time you sign in on your phone to a messaging or social app, its a widely used practice to begin by uploading your phone contacts.\n\n Sources: FTC Press Release, Facebook Press Release, Ars Technica, CNET, CNN, Reuters, The New York Times",

      "Content": "President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is needed to deport MS-13 gang members. His comments came after some Democratic lawmakers called for the agency to be dismantled.\nWhen we have an infestation of MS-13 GANGS in certain parts of our country, who do we send to get them out? ICE! the president tweeted. They are tougher and smarter than these rough criminal elelments (sic) that bad immigration laws allow into our country. Dems do not appreciate the great job they do! Nov. Midterm elections will be on Nov. 6. \nIn following tweet, Trump said, How can the Democrats, who are weak on the Border and weak on Crime, do well in November. The people of our Country want and demand Safety and Security, while the Democrats are more interested in ripping apart and demeaning (and not properly funding) our great Law Enforcement!\nSens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), as well as congressional candidate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez have called for the abolishment of ICE. And Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) has suggested starting from scratch regarding ICE, which was created in 2003 under the George W. Bush administration.\nThe official White House Twitter account directed messages to both Warren and Harris about their stance on ICE, suggesting the lawmakers were not aware of what ICE really does. The account tweeted examples of ICE removing alleged MS-13 gang members or people alleged to be affiliated with the gang.\nHarris later responded, As a career prosecutor, I actually went after gangs and transnational criminal organizations. That's being a leader on public safety. What is not, is ripping babies from their mothers.\nICE facilitated the separation of immigrant children and families at the border as part of the Trump administrations zero-tolerance policy of prosecuting all illegal border crossers. Trump signed an executive order last month to end family separations. The order did not provide a plan for family reunification.\nLast week, a federal judge in San Diego issued a preliminary injunction ordering the government to reunite children with undocumented parents from whom they have been separated under the Trump administrations zero-tolerance policy. The injunction ordered that children under five years old must be reunited with their parents within 14 days, and older children must be reunited within 30 days.\nMore information on the history of MS-13 is available in our Context section.\nSources: Breitbart, CNN, Fox News, Politico",

      "Content": "Jared Kushner, President Donald Trumps senior adviser and son-in-law, spoke on Monday before the Senate Intelligence Committee. The committee is investigating alleged Russian hacking and interference in the 2016 U.S. election, which Russia denies, and whether Trump campaign officials may have coordinated with Russia to do so.\nPrior to the closed-door session, Kushner publicly released an 11-page statement. Kushner, who had worked on Trumps campaign as a digital strategist, wrote, I did not collude, nor know of anyone else in the campaign who colluded, with any foreign government. I had no improper contacts. \nKushners statement said, With respect to my contacts with Russia or Russian representatives during the campaign, there were hardly any, adding that he had perhaps four contacts with Russian representatives during the campaign and transition period.\nKushner is also scheduled to appear before the House Intelligence Committee on Tuesday to respond to questions on the same topic.\nHighlights of Kushners written statement\n\n\tKushner filed an SF-86 form to gain security clearance as a White House adviser. The initial version of the form, filed on Jan. 18, did not include contacts with foreign officials. The next day, his team filed an addendum stating he had numerous contacts with foreign officials and would provide further details. In a subsequent update, he provided a list of more than 100 foreign officials.\n\tKushner said the incomplete form was filed due to a communication error with his assistant. He wrote, People at my New York office were helping me find the information, organize it, review it and put it into the electronic form. They sent an email to my assistant in Washington, communicating that the changes to one particular section were complete; my assistant interpreted that message as meaning that the entire form was completed.\n\tKushner also referred to a meeting in June 2016 at Trump Tower with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya and others, organized by Trumps son Donald Trump Jr. According to Kushners statement, he arrived late to the meeting, quickly determined that [his] time was not well-spent at [the] meeting, and emailed his assistant to call his cell phone so he could have an excuse to leave the meeting. He said he had not spoken to the lawyer since.\n\tKushner discussed two meetings with then-Russian Ambassador to the United States, Sergei Kislyak. The first time was in April 2016, when Trump was giving a foreign policy speech at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington, where Kushner said they shook hands and exchanged pleasantries. The second time was at Trump Tower on Dec. 1, 2016, and Kushner said the ambassador wanted to address U.S. policy in Syria.\n\tKushner confirmed he met with Sergei Gorkov, the head of Russian state-owned VneshEconomBank (VEB), on Dec. 13. He said he attended the meeting in part because Kislyak said Gorkov had a direct relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Previously, VEB said Gorkov met with Kushner because of Kushners real estate development business. Kushner disagreed with this account of the meeting, CNN reported. VEB has been subject to U.S. sanctions since July 2014. \n",

The footage appears to have come from the helmet camera of one of the U.S. soldiers, according to BBC and other media outlets. The alleged helmet-camera footage appears to show U.S. soldiers taking fire, returning fire, running and then the viewpoint of the camera falls and remains still as militants fire shots at point blank range. \nThe video also includes still images that allegedly show members of the Sahel-based group Jamaat Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM) pledging allegiance to IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. The video was reportedly released on the Telegram messaging application. \nSpeaking at the Pentagon, Col. Rob Manning, director of Defense press operations did not confirm the authenticity of the video footage. We didnt produce the video. We cant confirm something that we didnt produce. Manning requested the U.S. media not to purchase or show the videos, so as not to aid in IS recruiting. \nOctober attack\nA joint Niger-U.S. patrol was attacked near the village of Tongo Tongo in Niger on Oct. 4 last year while on a mission to search for a particular IS member. Four U.S. soldiers were killed, one of whom was originally reported missing. The troops did not expect to encounter enemy forces at the time of the attack, according to Marine Corps Gen. Joseph Dunford Jr., chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. \nAn investigation into the incident was completed by the U.S. Africa Command and the report is currently being reviewed by U.S. Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, according to Manning. \nThere are about 800 U.S. troops in Niger aiding in counterinsurgency operations, according to BBC. \nSources: BBC, Politico, USA Today",

It was a 4 cent increase since January, to an average hourly wage of $26.75. \nThe average work week was at 34.5 hours, an increase of 0.1 hours.\nIn February, there were about 6.7 million unemployed people (those who have actively looked for work in the past four weeks), and 373,000 so-called discouraged workers (those who are not looking for work because they think there are no available jobs for them). That represents a decrease of 29 percent since the same period last year. There were an additional 1.2 million people who had sought employment within the last year but stopped looking because they were attending school, had family responsibilities or other reasons.\nTwo weeks ago, the Federal Reserve estimated that the labor market in early 2018 appears to be near or a little beyond full employment. It said unemployment was somewhat below most estimates of its natural rate, in its Feb. 23 report. \nThe Department of Labor bases its calculations in part on household surveys.\nSources: Department of Labor, The Fed, CNBC, Reuters",

      "Content": "Special Counsel Robert Muellers investigation indicted 13 Russian nationals and three Russian entities for alleged interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, the Department of Justice announced on Friday. \nDeputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said, The defendants allegedly conducted what they called information warfare against the United States, with the stated goal of spreading distrust towards the candidates and the political system in general. \nThe Russians were charged with conspiracy to defraud the U.S. Three were also charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and bank fraud, and five were charged with aggravated identity theft. \nMueller has convened a grand jury as part of his investigation into alleged Russian interference in the election and whether any members of Trumps campaign colluded with Russia. \nRodenstein said the indictment did not allege that any American was a knowing participant in illegal activity, or that the actions altered the outcome of the 2016 election. He repeated that the investigation is ongoing. \nThe White House said in a statement that President Donald Trump had been fully briefed on the matter. It said the indictment indicates there was no collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, given that the charges allege an interference strategy began in 2014, before Trump declared his candidacy.\nWhat the indictment alleges\nThe indictment names Russian organization Internet Research Agency LLC, along with its employees, as a defendant, claiming that as early as May 2014 it began a strategy to interfere with the election. The companys stated goal was to spread distrust towards the candidates and the political system in general, according to the indictment.\nThe charge alleges that defendants created false American personas, social media accounts and groups. They are accused of spreading derogatory information about candidates, as well as organizing rallies for or against candidates. \nThe indictment refers to a memo the Internet Research Agency sent its staff in February 2016 about posting content to U.S. social media sites, instructing them to \"use any opportunity to criticize Hillary and the rest (except Sanders and Trump  we support them). At the time, Hillary Clinton and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders were competing in the Democratic primaries. \nThe indictment also alleges that one of the false personas contacted an unwitting Trump campaign official to request assistance in rally locations. It does not indicate whether the campaign official responded. \nThe Russian nationals are accused of organized competing rallies, including two in New York on Nov. 12: a Trump is NOT my President rally and a show your support for President-elect Donald Trump\" rally.\nThe indictment further alleges that employees of the Internet Research Agency committed identity theft to obtain PayPal accounts that were used to purchase advertisements on social media sites, and to pay for expenses including buttons, banners and flags at the rallies.\nRussian Foreign Ministry reponse\nRussian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova questioned the indictment on a Facebook post. 13 people intervened in the elections in the US? 13 against billion-dollar budgets of special services? Against intelligence and counterespionage, against the newest technologies? Absurd?  Yes. \nRead the full indictment here.\nSources: CNN, Fox News, White House Statement, Indictment",

The State Department named three groups operating in Israel or Egypt  Harakat al-Sabireen, Liwa al-Thawra and HASM  as SDGTs. It also designated Ismail Haniyeh, president of the Palestinian Hamas Political Bureau, as an SDGT, saying he has close links with Hamas military wing.\nAccording to Al Jazeera, Haniyeh, 54, was born in Gaza and was elected president of Hamas political wing in May 2017. The State Department said Haniyeh was allegedly involved in terrorist attacks on Israeli citizens and has been a proponent of armed struggle, including against civilians.\nThe department designated Hamas as a Foreign Terrorist Organization in 1997 and an SDGT in 2001. Israel, the EU and the U.K. have also designated Hamas a terrorist group. Hamas was founded in 1987 and through its military wing, has waged three wars against Israel and its occupation of the Gaza Strip since 2008. The State Department said Hamas is responsible for terrorist attacks that have killed an estimated 17 Americans.\nThe department said two of the groups it designated as SDGTs, Liwa al-Thawra and HASM, are active in Egypt, and have each claimed responsibility for assassinations and attacks there. It said the third group, Harakat al-Sabireen, is Iranian-backed, and operates primarily in Gaza and the West Bank, carrying out terrorist attacks against Israel.\nAs a result of these designations, the State Department issued sanctions saying, Among other consequences, all of their property and interests in property subject to U.S. jurisdiction are blocked, and U.S. persons are generally prohibited from engaging in any transactions with them. A travel ban to the U.S. is also placed onSDGT designees.\nSources: Al Jazeera, BBC, U.S. State Department",

      "Content": "A Malaysian court sentenced a Danish citizen to one week in jail after he pleaded guilty to making a false statement about police response time to a shooting. The conviction of Salah Salem Saleh Sulaiman, 46, was the first under a new law prohibiting fake news. \nSalah was arrested on April 23, two days after he shared a YouTube video in response to the death of Fadi al-Batsh, a Palestinian electrical engineer and member of the political group Hamas who was shot by two people on a motorcycle. Salah said in Arabic on the video that police took 50 minutes to respond to the shooting. According to Malaysias inspector general of police, records show police responded within eight minutes of the distress call that was received at 6:41 a.m. local time on April 21. \nSalah, who was not represented by a lawyer, is a Danish citizen of Yemeni descent who was on holiday in Malaysia. He said he made a mistake and apologized to Malaysian police and everybody in the country, adding that he had posted the video in a moment of anger and did not intend harm. I agree I did a mistake because I didn't ask what is the law of this country, he said speaking in English.\nThe court in the capital city of Kuala Lumpur also ordered Salah to pay a fine of 10,000 ringgit ($2,550). He said he would serve an extra month in jail because he did not have the money to pay the fine, an option Judge Zaman Mohamad Noor presented. \nThe Malaysian parliament approved the new law on April 2, more than a month before the general election scheduled for May 9. The Anti-Fake News Act defines fake news as news, information, data and reports which is or are wholly or partly false. It applies to written news, social media posts, audio and visual reports, and carries a maximum sentence of six years in prison and up to 500,000 ringgit ($128,000) in fines.\n\nA Malaysian media company, Malaysiakini, has filed a lawsuit against the legislation claiming it is unconstitutional. The constitution grants Malaysian citizens the right to freedom of speech and expression, in Art. 8, clause 10(1)(a). Another clause, Art 8, c.10(2)(a), allows the government to impose laws that limit that freedom if it is deemed necessary in the interest of security of the Federation, public order or morality, to protect the government, or to provide against contempt of court, defamation, or incitement to any offence.\nSources: AFP, AP, Reuters, Malaysia Constitution in English",

The two journalists, Wa Lone, 32, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 28, were sentenced to seven years in prison. They can appeal the decision to a regional court.\nThe reporters had pleaded not guilty and alleged that they were framed by the police, according to The Associated Press.\nJudge Ye Lwin said Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo violated the Official Secrets Act when they reportedly obtained confidential documents from police. Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo had been reporting on the countrys treatment and alleged killing of Rohingya Muslims in Rakhine State.\nThe U.S., United Nations and other countries recently accused Myanmar military and police commanders of ethnic cleansing of the Rohingya people in Rakhine state. An estimated 700,000 Rohingya have left their homes since 2017.\nToday is a sad day for Myanmar, Reuters journalists Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, and the press everywhere, Reuters editor in chief Stephen Adler said in a statement. We will not wait while Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo suffer this injustice and will evaluate how to proceed in the coming days, including whether to seek relief in an international forum.\nNonprofit organization Amnesty International called for the journalists release and suggested the sentence may have been an attempt to censor the countrys media. This politically-motivated decision has significant ramifications for press freedom in Myanmar, Amnesty International director of crisis response Tirana Hassan said, It sends a stark warning to other journalists in the country of the severe consequences that await should they look too closely at military abuses. This amounts to censorship through fear.\nThe journalists had testified that two police officials handed them papers at a restaurant in the city of Yangon right before other police officers arrested them. A police witness at the trial corroborated the journalists account, saying the restaurant encounter was a set-up to punish them for reporting on the killing of Rohingya Muslims in Rakhine, according to Reuters.\nWa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo were arrested on Dec. 12 while investigating alleged abuses committed by Myanmar soldiers, including the killing of 10 Rohingya men and boys in a Rakhine state village called Inn Din. \nThe Myanmar government has denied allegations of abuse and denied that it has attacked civilians. The government has described its actions against the Rohingya in Rakhine State as counter-insurgency operations against militant terrorist groups. \n",

      "Content": "Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified for nearly five hours before the Senate Commerce and Judiciary committees on Tuesday about the social media platforms handling of user data.\n \n It is the first of two scheduled hearings on Facebooks data sharing practices. The second hearing will be held Wednesday before the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.\nAccording to The Guardian, 44 senators each had five minutes to question Zuckerberg. Senators questioned the CEO on issues such as hate speech, political bias, data collection, regulations, social media addiction, and political ad purchases. They also questioned Zuckerberg on the companys terms of service agreement, whether the company may be considered a monopoly, and Facebooks involvement with data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica.\nLast week, the company said the data of as many as 87 million users, about 82 percent of them from the U.S., had been improperly shared with Cambridge Analytica. \nIn his opening statement, Zuckerberg said Cambridge Analytica improperly accessed [Facebook user] information by buying it. He said the company planned to investigate every app on its platform to make sure no other app developers out there are misusing data. Zuckerberg also apologized for the companys inability to prevent the platform from being used to disseminate fake news stories, and for its role in improperly sharing user data with Cambridge Analytica.\nZuckerberg entered the Senate committee room at 2:29 p.m. Eastern, and the hearing ended around 7:27 p.m., accounting for short breaks.\nExcerpts from questions and testimony \nDuring the hearing, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) asked Zuckerberg how many other instances of improper data transfer have occurred, to which Zuckerberg replied that the company is currently conducting an audit to determine that. \nSen. John Thune (R-S.D.) asked Zuckerberg what the company was doing to address so-called hate speech on the platform. Zuckerberg noted that Facebook plans to increase staff and enhance artificial intelligence. \nI am optimistic, that over a five- to 10-year period we will have [artificial intelligence] tools that can get into some of the linguistic nuances of different types of content to be more accurate in flagging things for our systems, Zuckerberg said. But today we're just not there on that. So a lot of this [is] still reactive. People flag it to us, we have people look at it, we have policies to make it as not subjective as possible. But until we get more automated theres a higher error rate than I am happy with.\nSen. Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.) asked whether Facebook employees worked directly with any Cambridge Analytica employees during the 2016 presidential campaign. Zuckerberg said he didnt know. I know we did help out the Trump campaign overall in sales support in the same way that we [do] with all other campaigns, he added.\nSen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) asked whether Facebook employees had been interviewed by Special Counsel Robert Muellers office. While Zuckerberg confirmed that Facebook employees had been interviewed, he could not state whether they had been subpoenaed. The CEO said he had not personally spoken with the investigation. \nSen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) questioned whether Facebook has a political bias. Zuckerberg said he tries to make sure Facebook doesn't have any bias.\nSen. Deb Fischer (R-Neb.) asked Zuckerberg to describe the type of user data that Facebook collects. Zuckerberg said the two primary data categories include content that a person has chosen to share, and data that is used to make ads relevant to users who see it.\nWhen questioned by Sen. Tom Udall (D-N.M.) about Facebooks role in alleged Russian election interference, Zuckerberg said Facebook planned to increase its security team by more than 20,000 people to help verify the advertisers who post ads considered to be about either political or social issues, to prevent the type of interference experienced in the 2016 election. Zuckerberg also noted that he could not guarantee that fake political ads would not appear on Facebook again.\nSources: CNN, The Guardian, BBC",

      "Content": "The U.S. held an opening ceremony for its new embassy in Jerusalem at 4 p.m. local time on Monday, the 70th anniversary of the founding of Israel. About 800 people were expected to attend the event, including an American delegation whose members include Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, presidential senior advisors Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, and some foreign officials. President Donald Trump announced last December that the U.S. would relocate its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.\nSpeaking at a celebratory event on the ministry grounds on Sunday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said, President Trump is making history. Our people will be eternally grateful for his decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israels capital. About 1,000 guests attended the event, among whom was Treasury Secretary Mnuchin.\nSome ambassadors from countries that oppose the U.S. embassy move said they would not attend the opening ceremony. Ayman Odeh, leader of the Arab faction in Israels parliament, said, This one-sided move strengthens Israels occupation and takes us further from peace.\nThe U.S. repurposed another consular facility for the new embassy. Given the building is not large enough for all U.S. consular staff, some officials will commute back and forth from Tel Aviv. The two cities are about 44 miles (70 km) apart.\nThe U.S. is the first country to move its embassy to Jerusalem and recognize the city as the capital of Israel. Palestinians held protests after Trump announced the move. The Czech Republic, Guatemala, Paraguay and Romania later announced they will also move their embassies to Jerusalem, according to Egypt Today and The Times of Israel. \nOn Sunday, Israelis also commemorated the reunification of Jerusalem after Israel captured East Jerusalem in 1967. The annexation of East Jerusalem by Israel is not recognized internationally.\nMore than 1,000 Israeli police officers were working with U.S. officials to provide security for the embassy opening, according to an Israeli police spokesman. Palestinians have planned protests against the embassy opening in different parts of Palestinian territories.\nPalestinians have been protesting in Gaza since March 30. They have called for the return of Palestinians to areas of Israel where they or their ancestors lived prior to the May 1948 war between Israel and neighboring countries. Israeli snipers have killed at least 49 Palestinians and wounded more than 2,200 since the protests began, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. \nTuesday is Nakba Day, recognizing the approximately 750,000 people who left their homes in the violence leading up to and during the 1948 war. More than 70 percent of Palestinians who live in Gaza are refugees from Israel or descendants of refugees, according to The Washington Post. The U.N. has endorsed their right to return to Israel.\nIsrael withdrew its forces from Gaza in 2005, and restricts the movement of people and goods in and out of Gaza.\n\nSources: Al Jazeera, Bloomberg, Egypt Today, The Guardian, The Times of Israel, The Washington Post",

Strzok and Page, two senior FBI officials, are former members of Robert Muellers investigative team. Strzok was removed after a text message allegedly showed he had a bias against the president. \nStrzok and Page have investigated both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. They participated in the investigation into Clintons use of a private email server during her tenure as secretary of state, as well as the investigation into whether Trumps campaign coordinated with Russian agents during the 2016 presidential election. \nIn December, The Washington Post reported that in July 2017 Strzok was removed from the Mueller investigation into Trumps campaign, after an internal investigation found he and Page exchanged messages critical of Trump and messages in support of Clinton while investigating both politicians. Page had left the investigative team two weeks prior, reportedly due to an unrelated reason. \nOn Monday, U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions stated that Strzok and Page exchanged more than 50,000 texts between Dec. 14, 2016 and May 17, 2017. Federal officials announced Wednesday that thousands of FBI cell phones had a technical glitch, preventing Strzok and Page from uploading messages into the FBIs archive system. \nHorowitz said that copies of the messages would be provided to the DOJ and that attempts to recover additional messages are ongoing. \nSources: Fox News, The Washington Post",

The investigators ruled out other possible explanations such as aircraft malfunction, remote control of the planes operation systems and the pilots mental state.\nKok Soo Chon, head of the investigation team, said, we are not of the opinion it could have been an event committed by the pilots. He added the investigators werent ruling out the possibility the manual inputs came from the pilot, the co-pilot or unlawful interference by a third person or third party.\nOn March 8, 2014, flight MH370 carrying 237 passengers was en route from the Malaysian capital city of Kuala Lumpur to Chinas capital, Beijing. The last communication recorded from the aircraft was when Capt. Zaharie Ahmad Shah said, Good night, Malaysia, as the plane left Malaysian airspace. At some point after Shahs communication, the plane went off course and turned back towards Malaysia. \nMalaysian investigators say the planes course was probably manually changed and the planes systems were manually turned off. Australian Transport Safety Bureau investigators said that everyone on MH370 would have been unconscious when the plane ran out of fuel and crashed into the Indian Ocean.\nAfter the planes disappearance, Malaysia, China, and Australia carried out a search in a 710,000 square kilometer area of the Indian Ocean. The search was ended in January 2017. A privately funded search from Malaysia was ended in May of this year. The only pieces of the aircraft that have been recovered are three wing fragments. \nMalaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Bin Mohamad said the country would consider resuming the search for the aircraft if new evidence became available.\nSources: CNN, The Washington Post",

      "Content": "U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said on Tuesday that freedom of thought and speech at universities was under attack. Speaking at a High School Leadership Summit, he said, Too many schools are coddling young people and actively preventing them from scrutinizing the validity of their beliefs and the issues of the day. Mary Sue Coleman, president of the Association of American Universities, said in response, The idea that were somehow protecting [students] from any idea that may be controversial is a total mischaracterization.\nThe sponsor of the event, Turning Point USA, is a non-profit organization whose mission is to identify, educate, train, and organize students to promote the principles of fiscal responsibility, free markets, and limited government, according to its website. The speech was held at George Washington University in Washington, D.C. \nSessions said, Rather than molding a generation of mature, well-informed adults, some schools are doing everything they can to create a generation of sanctimonious, sensitive, supercilious snowflakes.  That is a disservice to the students and a disservice to the nation. \nSessions also spoke about freedom of speech zones on some university campuses where students could say things in limited areas that university policies prohibited them from saying elsewhere on campus. He discussed protests and cancellations of multiple conservative speakers events at universities as well.\nSessions said last year the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE) had surveyed 450 colleges and universities across the U.S. and found that 40 percent of universities had speech codes that he said substantially infringe on constitutionally-protected speech. That percentage had decreased to 32 percent this year, he added. According to its website, the mission of FIRE is to defend and sustain the individual rights of students and faculty members at Americas colleges and universities. It said those rights included freedom of speech and association, due process, legal equality, religious liberties and sanctity of conscience.\nToo many schools are coddling students, Sessions said. After the 2016 election, for example, they held a cry-in at Cornell  they had therapy dogs at the University of Kansas and Play-Doh and coloring books at the University of Michigan. They have cry closets, safe spaces, optional exams, therapy goats and grade inflation, he said. I can tell this group isnt going to have to have Play-Doh when you get attacked in college. \nSome of the practices that Sessions mentioned, such as therapy animals, are designed to reduce rates of stress, depression and suicide on college campuses. According to the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention (AFSP), in 2016, suicide was the second leading cause of death of college students. The AFSP said, Over the past decade, colleges and universities have made considerable efforts to promote how and where students can get help for mental health problems both on and off campus.\nIn his speech, Sessions also mentioned trigger warnings, which certain universities use to inform people about speakers subject matter that some may find traumatic. \nColeman, the university association president and a former president of the University of Michigan, said after Sessions speech, I dont think [college students are] coddled. I dont think theyre given undue access to support services.\nAt the event, Sessions said, When you get involved in a debate, youre going to stand up and defend yourselves and the values that you believe in. \nI like this bunch, I gotta tell ya, youre not going to be backing down, he said. Go get em! Go get em! \nA moment later, the crowd began to chant Lock her up! Sessions repeated the phrase once, then laughed and said, I heard that a long time over the last campaign. \nDuring President Donald Trumps presidential campaign and at rallies while he has been president, audiences have sometimes chanted Lock her up! in an apparent reference to Hillary Clinton, who was investigated by the FBI for her use of a private email server while she was secretary of state in the Obama administration.\nOther people scheduled to speak at the leadership event which runs through Thursday include U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, and Donald Trump, Jr.\nSessions' full speech is available to watch here.\nSources: AP, AFSP, C-SPAN, Fox News, Justice Department, Politico, The New York Times\n",

They are scheduled for a hearing before a judge on Jan. 16.\nThe suit filed in the U.S. District Court in Washington alleges Rosenstein went beyond his authority to appoint a special counsel as well as specific restrictions on the scope of such appointments in 2017 when he appointed Mueller as special counsel. It also says Rosenstein gave Mueller the authority to pursue any matters that arose or may arise from that investigation, including matters remote from the specific matter identified as the subject of the appointment order. The suit claims lobbying work Manafort and Gates did in Ukraine ended in 2014 and was not associated with Trumps campaign. \nSources: CNN, Fox News",

      "Content": "Facebook held its quarterly earnings call on Wednesday at 5 p.m. EDT, after markets had closed for the day. Revenue increased 42 percent to $13.2 billion for the second quarter. Analysts had projected $13.3 billion. CFO David Wehner said the company expected its operating margins to trend towards the mid-30s on a percentage basis over the next several years, down from the second quarters 44 percent. Facebook (FB) stock ended Thursday down 41.24 points (18.96 percent) at $176.26 per share. \nThe stock had closed the previous day at a record high of $217.50, up 23 percent from the years start. \nThe first quarter of 2015 was the last time the company missed revenue estimates, according to Bloomberg. Wehner said revenue growth rates would decline in the second half of 2018 due to currency headwinds, providing users more data privacy choices and greater investments in products like Instagrams Stories that have lower levels of monetization.\nThe companys margin decreased to 44 percent, compared to 47 percent in the second quarter a year ago. The company reported earnings of $1.74 per share, which exceeded analysts expectations of $1.72 per share.\nFacebook said it had 2.23 billion active monthly users, with 1.47 billion daily active users in June, up 11 percent from last year. The median analyst projection for the end of the second quarter was 1.48 billion daily active users. Daily active users in the U.S. and Canada remained at 185 million, and in Europe declined by 1 percent from 282 to 279 million. The 22 million daily active users Facebook added in the second quarter was down from the 41 million it added in the second quarter of 2017.\nFacebook owns WhatsApp, Messenger and Instagram, which combine with Facebook to host a total of 2.5 billion monthly users, the company said. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said Instagram had grown twice as fast as it would have, if it were not acquired by Facebook in 2012 for about $1 billion in cash and stock. He did not explain how he arrived at that number. \nWehner said the company putting privacy first will likely have some impact on revenue growth. He said complying with new European data protection regulations would have a modest impact on growth. The General Data Protection Regulation went into effect in Europe in the second quarter to protect all EU citizens from privacy and data breaches. Facebook then asked European users to check their privacy settings on the site, and noted it had fewer daily users in Europe after the regulation took effect.\nWehner said the company will invest billions of dollars per year in improving the safety and security of its product, and that we think thats the right thing to do for the business.\nWe plan to grow and promote certain engaging experiences like [Instagrams] Stories that currently have lower levels of monetization, and we are also giving people who use our services more choices around data privacy, which may have an impact on our revenue growth, Wehner said.\nFacebook said it would increase investments in video content, artificial intelligence and virtual reality. It also said it had 30,275 employees worldwide as of June 30, up 47 percent from last year.\nBefore the earnings call, Wall Street analysts had issued 44 buy ratings, two sells and two hold ratings on the companys stock. The median target price was $219.30. At least 16 analysts decreased their price targets for Facebooks stock after the call, Reuters reported. \nIssues facing the company\nIn April, Zuckerberg testified before the U.S. House and Senate committees, apologizing for the company not doing enough to prevent Facebook from being used for harm resulting from fake news, foreign interference in elections, and hate speech. He also spoke about privacy issues, including data from as many as 87 million users having been improperly shared with Cambridge Analytica, a company that used the data to aid the election campaigns of its clients, including Donald Trump and Sen. Ted Cruz. \nOne investor has filed a proposal to remove Zuckerberg as CEO, citing mishandling of multiple issues at the company, Fortune reported. \nIn April, Facebook announced data policy changes in response to the Cambridge Analytica data sharing. In May, Facebook implemented new rules for political advertisers to verify their identities to help prevent future interference in elections on Facebook.\nBefore the earnings report, Zuckerberg had a net worth of $82.5 billion, which decreased to $67.1 billion after the stock price decline Thursday, according to Forbes. Facebooks market cap decreased by about $119 billion in a day.\nSources: Bloomberg, CNN, Forbes, Fortune, Fox News, Reuters, Seeking Alpha, The New York Times",

      "Content": "On Monday morning, an explosion in a corridor connecting two subway stations in Manhattan injured four people, including the suspected bomber. The explosion took place at 7:20 a.m. local time in a tunnel beneath 42nd Street, between the Times Square and Port Authority stations. New York City Police Department Commissioner James O'Neill identified the suspect as Akayed Ullah, 27. O'Neill said the preliminary investigation at the scene indicates this individual was wearing an improvised low-tech explosive device attached to his body and that he intentionally detonated that device. U.S. Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders held a White House press briefing after the attack. \nUllah sustained burns to his stomach and hands. He has been taken into custody and is currently hospitalized. Three bystanders near the explosion sustained headaches and ringing in the ears. The New York City Fire Department reported the three went to the hospital.\nAccording to media reports, Ullah is a Bangladeshi national. The Associated Press reported that he was inspired by the Islamic State (IS) group, and that he had apparently no direct contact with the group and had probably acted alone. According to CNN, Ullah told investigators he had carried out the attack because of recent Israeli actions in Gaza.\nNew York Mayor Bill de Blasio said to reporters, This was an attempted terrorist attack.\nDuring the White House briefing, Sanders referred to President Donald Trumps policy to end so-called chain-migration, a term the administration has used to describe family-reunification-based immigration laws. These laws allow U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents to sponsor close family members to join them in the country. According to the White House, Ullah arrived in the U.S. in 2011 on an F-43 family immigrant visa.\nSanders told reporters, The president is certainly concerned that Congress, particularly Democrats, have failed to take action in some places where we feel we could have prevented this. She added, Specifically, the presidents policy has called for an end to chain migration, and if that had been in place that would have prevented this individual from coming to the United States. So the president is aggressively going to continue to push forth responsible immigration reform, and ending chain migration would certainly be a part of that process.\nCNN reported that Sanders did not answer a follow-up question about whether Ullah had been radicalized while living in the U.S., as have recent terrorist attackers in the US who were not natural born citizens.\nSources: AP, CNN, NPR, Politico",

      "Content": "Former movie producer Harvey Weinstein turned himself in to the New York City Police Department (NYPD) on Friday, was arrested and charged with two counts of rape and one count of a criminal sexual act in the first degree in a felony complaint. The charges relate to allegations from two women in separate incidents. Weinsteins attorney Benjamin Brafman said his client entered a plea of not guilty at his arraignment on Friday.\nWeinstein, 66, was released after posting $1 million bail and surrendering his passport. He will be required to wear a GPS monitoring device and refrain from traveling outside of New York and Connecticut, the court ordered.\nThe criminal sex act charge against Weinstein relates to a 2004 incident involving former actress Lucia Evans, CNN reported. The rape charges relate to a 2013 incident with a woman whose name has been sealed under an order of protection, as agreed by both parties, prosecutors said. \nThe maximum possible total sentence for these charges is 37 years in prison, according to Fox News.\nPrevious events\nArticles published last October by The New York Times and The New Yorker reported on at least 13 women who accused Weinstein of sexual misconduct or harassment. He was subsequently fired from the film studio he co-founded, The Weinstein Company. \nOn March 19 of this year, The Weinstein Company announced it would file for bankruptcy, and on May 1, the company announced Lantern Capital Partners had won the bid in its bankruptcy sale. Lantern acquired TWC for $310 million, assuming about $115 million of the companys debt.\nIn total, more than 80 women have made public accusations against Weinstein, according to Fox News. Weinstein has said he never engaged in non-consensual sexual behavior with anyone, according to Brafman.\nAfter the public accusations against Weinstein, other high-profile men were publicly accused of sexual misconduct. The New York Times wrote an article in February listing 71 such men. \nSources: Manhattan District Attorney Statement, CNN, Fox News, The New York Times 1, The New York Times 2, The New Yorker, USA Today\n",

      "Content": "Pope Francis conducted Mass at Phoenix Park in Dublin on Sunday to a crowd of hundreds of thousands during his two-day visit to Ireland. Francis visit was also met with protests over the Catholic Churchs handling of sexual abuse allegations against priests.\nWe ask forgiveness for the cases of abuse in Ireland, the abuse of power, the abuse of conscience and sexual abuse on the part of representatives of the Church, Francis said at the Mass. We ask forgiveness for all those times when, as a Church, we did not offer to the survivors of any type of abuse compassion and the pursuit of justice and truth by concrete actions.\nThe Catholic Church has been the subject of abuse allegations for several decades. Recently, claims of sexual abuse by Catholic priests have been made in Chile, Australia and the United States. On Aug. 14, a Pennsylvania Grand Jury released a report alleging that over 70 years, 301 priests in the investigated areas in the state sexually abused more than 1000 victims. It estimated the number of victims was in the thousands. \nOn Sunday, former Vatican ambassador to Washington, Carlo Maria Vigan, called for Francis to step down as pope, alleging he ignored the ambassadors report on sexual abuse allegations against U.S.-based Cardinal Theodore McCarrick in 2013. \nWhen asked about Vigans comments during the plane ride back to the Vatican, Francis said, I will not say a single word on this. Francis told reporters to make your own judgement on Vigans statement.\nMcCarrick, 88, resigned last month over the abuse allegations, which dated back to 1971. The allegations were made through the Archdiocese of New Yorks Independent Reconciliation and Compensation Program. The program aims to promote healing and bring closure by providing compensation to victim-survivors of abuse by priests or deacons of the archdiocese. \nMcCarrick, who was secretary to Cardinal Terence Cooke in New York at the time, allegedly grabbed an altar boys genitals on two separate occasions. The Archdiocese of New York, who also turned the case over to New York law enforcement, is leading the investigation. \nMcCarrick said of the allegations, While I have absolutely no recollection of this reported abuse, and believe in my innocence, I am sorry for the pain the person who brought the charges has gone through, as well as for the scandal such charges cause our people.\nMcCarrick was also accused of sexual misconduct three times while he served as a bishop in Metuchen and Newark, New Jersey. Two of those cases resulted in settlements with the alleged victims, according to CNN.\nFrancis visited Ireland to attend the World Meeting of Families, a church event held every three years to highlight the importance of marriage and the family.\nIrelands population is more than 78 percent Catholic, according to 2016 Census data, equaling approximately 3.7 million people. \n\nSources: CNN - Pope Mass, CNN - McCarrick, Faith Survey, Independent Reconciliation and Compensation Program, NPR, Vatican Mass report, World Meeting of Families",

      "Content": "On Thursday, the British government released a White Paper titled The future relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union. The government said the 104-page document provides a detailed proposal for a principled and practical Brexit, and that it explains how the U.K.-EU relationship would work, what benefits it would deliver for both sides, and why it would respect the sovereignty of the U.K. as well as the autonomy of the EU.\nThe White Paper expanded on the Chequers agreement released on July 6, which the cabinet approved as a vision for a relationship between the U.K. and the bloc.\nThe U.K. is scheduled to leave the EU on March 29, 2019, after the country voted to leave the EU in a June 2016 referendum. \nThe White Paper\nThe White Paper is divided into four chapters covering different areas of future cooperation between the EU and the U.K., including: economic partnership, security, cooperation in areas such as aviation and nuclear power, and institutional frameworks for enforcing agreements. \nThe White Paper said there will be more trade barriers with the bloc after the U.K. leaves. The U.K. would use a common rule book for trade of goods with the EU. It would not use such a rule book on services, which represent the majority of trade with the EU, according to the BBC. \nBritish citizens and businesses would no longer be able to bring cases to the European Court of Justice, and the court would not be able to rule on British cases.\nThe White Paper said the U.K. would stop the free movement of people from the EU to the U.K. by the end of December 2020. It said 3.5 million EU citizens currently live in the U.K., and that after December 2020, EU citizens may be allowed to enter the country without visas to do paid work in limited and clearly defined circumstances. It also said there could be reciprocal arrangements between the U.K. and the EU for limited benefits or social security for citizens of the two sides. The document also proposed EU students could be allowed to study in Britain.\nThe White Paper provides details on a proposed customs system, the Facilitated Customs Arrangement, under which the U.K. could collect some EU tariffs on goods. The European Court of Justice would be the interpreter of EU rules, such as the rules on trade. \nResponses to the White Paper\nDominic Raab, the newly appointed Brexit Secretary after David Davis resigned from the role on Sunday, said the White Paper was a proposal for a \"principled, pragmatic and ambitious future partnership between the U.K. and the EU.\nPrime Minister Theresa May said the proposal absolutely delivers on the Brexit we voted for. She added that the British people voted for us to take back control of our money, our law and our borders. That is exactly what we will do.\"\nConservative party member of parliament Jacob Rees-Mogg said, \"There are very few signs of the prime minister's famous red lines. It is a pale imitation of the paper prepared by David Davis, a bad deal for Britain. It is not something I would vote for, nor is it what the British people voted for.\"\nFormer Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith said he had \"deep misgivings\" about the White Paper. He added, \"I voted to leave not to half leave.\nThe EUs lead negotiator Michel Barnier said the bloc would analyze the White Paper and was looking forward to negotiations with the U.K. next week.\nThe European Parliaments lead Brexit negotiator, Guy Verhofstadt, said, \"We will analyze the White Paper in light of our priorities: citizens' rights, an operational backstop for Ireland and a deep economic relationship based on the integrity of the Union and internal market.\"\nSources: BBC, The Guardian, UK government",

      "Content": "President Donald Trump responded to Wednesdays shooting at a Florida high school that killed 17 students and teachers, saying that the nation is praying for the victims and their families. Speaking from the White House on Thursday, Trump told Americas children, especially those who feel lost, alone, confused or even scared that they are never alone and have people who care about them. \nTrump said America must work together to create a culture in our country that embraces the dignity of life, that creates deep and meaningful human connections, and that turns classmates and colleagues into friends and neighbors. \nThe president added that his administration was committed to working with state and local leaders to help secure our schools, and tackle the difficult issue of mental health. He announced he would meet with the nations governors and attorney generals, and the top priority of the meeting would be making our schools and our children safer. He did not elaborate on any specific measures or policies the administration would consider. \nPrior to his speech, Trump tweeted: So many signs that the Florida shooter was mentally disturbed, even expelled from school for bad and erratic behavior. Neighbors and classmates knew he was a big problem. Must always report such instances to authorities, again and again!\nThe shooting\nPolice identified Nikolas Cruz, 19, as the suspect who fatally shot 17 people and injured 14 more at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. He had been a student until he was recently expelled. The county sheriff said Cruz was armed with a AR-15 semiautomatic rifle and multiple magazines.\nCruz was charged on Thursday with 17 counts of premeditated murder, one for each person killed. He is being held without bail at a local jail, and was placed on suicide watch, according to the countys chief assistant public defender Gordon Weekes.\nThe New York Times reported that the AR-15 used in the attack had been purchased legally. Peter Forcelli, the special agent in charge for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives in Miami, said, no laws were violated in the procurement of this weapon. \nFlorida Senator Bill Nelson said the FBI also indicated the shooter wore a gas mask and carried smoke grenades. On the Senate floor on Thursday, Nelson said, lets talk about that 19-year-old carrying an AR-15. He called for better background checks. \nSources: White House Statement, Fox News, The New York Times",

      "Content": "Kanye West recently made headlines for tweeting his support for Donald Trump and saying slavery for 400 years sounds like a choice. Here's an overview of his life, accomplishments and previous comments and actions that made headlines. \nWho is Kanye West?\nFull name: Kanye Omari West.\nBorn: June 8, 1977 in Atlanta, Ga., to Ray and Donda West.\nSpouse: Kim Kardashian West (2014  present).\nChildren: North West, 4; Saint West, 2; Chicago West, 3 months.\nPersonal life: Wests father was a photojournalist, a former Black Panther member and counselor. Wests mother was a teacher. After his parents divorced in 1980, West moved with his mother to Chicagos South Shore neighborhood.

In 2015, West received an honorary doctorate from the School of the Art Institute in Chicago.\nMusic career:West started his career by producing for local artists.

He then went on to contribute tracks to artists such as Cam'ron, Talib Kweli, Nas, T.I., Beyonc, and Ludacris.\nIn 2002, after getting into a car accident that required his jaw to be wired shut, West wrote and recorded a song about his experience called, Through the Wire, while his jaw was still wired shut. According to Rolling Stone, the song helped West gain publicity for his first album, The College Dropout. In addition to creating his own music, West continued to produce tracks for other artists, including musicians John Legend and Brandy.\nStudio Discography\n2004: The College Dropout\n2005: Late Registration\n2007: Graduation\n2008: 808s  Heartbreak\n2010: My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy\n2013: Yeezus\n2016: The Life of Pablo\n2018: TBD\nAwards\nKanye West has won 21 Grammys and has been nominated 68 times.

Bushs handling of Hurricane Katrina during NBC's A Concert for Hurricane Relief. West said, George Bush doesn't care about black people. He also criticized the media, adding, I hate the way they portray us in the media. If you see a black family, it says they're looting. See a white family, it says they're looking for food.\n2009: West interrupted singer Taylor Swifts acceptance speech at the MTV Video Music Awards after she won for Best Female Video. West walked on stage while Swift was talking and took the microphone to say that Beyonc had one of the best videos of all time.

In response to Bushs memoir, on a Houston-based radio show, West said he could understand how Bush felt because he had also been called racist. He added, With both situations, it was strictly a lack of compassion that America saw. You know, with him not rushing, not taking the time to rush down to New Orleans. With me, it was the lack of compassion in cutting someone off in their moment. Nonetheless, I think we're all quick to pull a race card in America. And now I'm more open, and the poetic justice that I went through the same thing that he went through, and now I really more connect with him on a humanitarian level, because that next morning, when he felt that, I felt that same thing too.\n2011: During a performance in England, West said: I walk through the hotel and I walk down the street, and people look at me like I'm insane, like I'm Hitler, he said.
